 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Central Michigan University (CMU) to support the Museum of Cultural and Natural History (MCNH), which holds a research collection of fish, reptile, and amphibian specimens stored in alcohol, posing a significant and urgent safety risk for the campus. These collections are currently housed in a former classroom in a building not rated to hold flammable substances and lacks a fire suppression system and industry standard flammable storage cabinets.  These specimens are of research significance conducted in and around the Great Lakes Ecoregion, particularly in support of understanding and mitigating environmental threats. This vital ecosystem, which contains ninety percent of the fresh water in the United States, has large and direct economic, health, and well-being impacts on the region, necessitating its protection. The research and teaching value of the collection has led MCNH to identify dedicated space on campus with fire suppression where they can place proper flammable safety cabinets that will mitigate fire or explosion risks while maintaining the highest professional museum standards. This award will allow MCNH to acquire equipment and hire personnel to pack, move, rehouse in cabinets, and re-inventory the collection during the course of one year.  MCNH is a laboratory museum supporting Michigan's oldest practical museum training program.  This project will also support CMU's Museum Studies Program students to gain real-life experience in resolving safety hazard issues and to understand safe handling practices for natural history collections stored in alcohol. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis award will allow The Museum of Cultural and Natural History (MCNH) at Central Michigan University (CMU) to save critical ethanol-preserved specimens by eliminating a flammability threat to campus while maintaining safety and security.  These collections document the ichthyological and herpetological history of the Laurentian Great Lakes (both native and invasive species) and are used and developed by current researchers, including those working with CMU's Institute for Great Lakes Research (IGLR).  Completion of this project will also enable MCNH to resume accepting fish, reptile, and amphibian specimen donations, which is currently impeded due to safety concerns. The project will further increase access to these collections for research by allowing MCNH to maintain an online presence through the iDigBio (idigbio.org) and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) web portals, increasing access to MCNH collections.  The MCNH will eventually house these collections in one contiguous space, however due to the currently prohibitive cost of such an endeavor, this project addresses an immediate concern by dispersing the collections in flammable storage cabinets to a series of control areas while still allowing security and physical control of the specimens within accepted museum standards.  This project will prove invaluable experience for CMU's Museum Studies Program students, as well as making these specimens more accessible for future research, teaching, educational programming, and exhibits.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Measures to ameliorate the flammability risk issues with the collection started as early as 2015 and included new industry standard storage jars and lids, and the recommendation that the collection either be placed in flammables storage cabinets in a specially retrofitted room or consider disposing of the collection.  The ?one room? idea proved to be too costly and an alternative was devised to place cabinets in a series of spaces rated to spread the flammability load in various control areas around campus.  Ultimately the National Science Foundation chose to support this alternative project, and funding was allocated for 21 flammables storage cabinets, equipment/supplies, and labor costs. \n\nBecause the MCNH is a training museum that supports the Museum Studies Minor program, one Graduate Assistant and five undergraduate students worked under the supervision of the Co-PI?s throughout the duration of the project.   Specimens were evaluated, placed in new jars (as necessary), given fresh ethanol (as necessary), and inventoried.  Approximately 880 specimens were set aside for deaccessioning and disposal due to condition and/or scope of collections issues.  These specimens were placed in one flammables storage cabinet until the lengthy deaccessioning/disposal process can take place.

Student staff then moved the containers of specimens in groups across campus to these flammables storage cabinets using carts with pneumatic wheels.  An in-progress inventory was done, followed by a final inventory of all cabinets.  Location information was then updated in our PastPerfect collections database and any changes necessary made to information in the listing on iDigBio.  Staff from the Office of Laboratory and Field Safety monitored the Formaldehyde and Ethanol levels during the project and in the cabinets after the move was complete.  We will continue to monitor temperature and humidity within these spaces using wireless datalogging equipment provided by the grant and Formaldehyde and Ethanol vapors at prescribed times during the year to make sure the collection is properly preserved and personnel (museum staff/instructors) are safe to access these spaces.        \n\nThe dispersing of MCNH?s Ethanol-stored teaching and research collections has ultimately provided the following benefits:  1) Allowed retention and preservation of the collection within the University environment;  2)  Ameliorated a major explosion and fire hazard;  3)  Afforded six students practical and in-depth hands-on experience working with natural history specimen collections;  4)  Created a case study that can be used to illustrate proper Natural History collections management to future Museum Studies students;  5)  Increased access to the collection by instructors since many of the flammables cabinets are now much closer (if not within) teaching/prep lab spaces;  6)  Demonstrated a proactive approach by several university departments to solve a problem using a unique approach, while increasing exposure to the museum collection, informing new lab safety protocols, and promoting good collections stewardship;  7)  Advanced the mission of the Museum of Cultural and Natural History.\n\n \n\n* An exact number of specimens is currently unknown because some jars have multiple specimens with the same catalog number?some fish (like Fry or Fingerlings) can number in the hundreds or thousands within a single catalog number.    \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/23/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ronald Bloomfield"
