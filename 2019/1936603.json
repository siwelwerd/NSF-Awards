 "awd_abstract_narration": "Life operates on a hardware that is composed of cells enclosing molecular components and a software encoded by information and programs written in molecules. With the vision of understanding the natural molecular programs and further establishing novel molecular programming rules for engineering and developing synthetic systems inside or outside of living cells, the annual International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming has been one of the premier interdisciplinary forums where scientists with diverse backgrounds (e.g.; experts in computer science, physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics) come together to present their research and discuss new ideas.  The application of molecular programming include development of molecularly-defined electronic and optical materials, the integration of molecular-scale recognition and amplification circuits within analytical techniques for studying biology, and `smart' therapeutics with programmable control over drug delivery. This award provides student travel support for the 25th International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming (DNA25), held at the University of Washington, Seattle, August 5-9, 2019.  By funding travel for students the organizers are actively encouraging and incentivizing a new generation of researchers to attend the conference. The travel awards will help to foster the development of the next generation of molecular programmers, by encouraging students to attend, present their work, and interact with other experts in the field. Students who attend the conference will get exposure to early versions of work that will go on to be published in top venues and, furthermore, they will have the opportunity to interact with, and potentially collaborate with, researchers who are producing work of the highest quality.\r\n\r\nOranizers plan to support up to 20 successful student applicants, who will be funded for travel and accommodation expenses.  The primary purpose of these funds is to provide assistance to women and underrepresented minorities who are delivering oral or poster presentations at the conference, and to graduate students who are otherwise unable to afford attending this conference.  The availability of the awards to US citizens and students at US institutions will be included in conference announcements, soliciting applications.  A committee of three faculty will decide on awards based on the above priorities. This highly interdisciplinary conference emphasizes topics that bridge computation, biology, and nanotechnology and attracting researchers in the fields of computer science, mathematics, chemistry, molecular biology, and nanotechnology. The scope includes control of molecular folding and self-assembly to construct nanostructures; demonstration of switches, gates, devices, and circuits with biomolecules; molecular motors and molecular robotics; computational processes in vitro and in vivo; studies of fault-tolerance and error correction; synthetic biology and in vitro evolution; software tools for analysis, simulation, and design; a range of applications in engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
