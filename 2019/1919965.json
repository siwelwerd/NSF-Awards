 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents a step toward a computational model capable of detecting early social behavioral markers in children at risk for autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The real-time 3D Social Signal Imaging System (SSIS) will be designed to precisely measure social signals utilizing cameras producing billions of pixels dozens of times per second. The infrastructure will be designed to enable reconstruction of the 3D geometry of gaze, face, finger, body, and physical appearance. The system is expected to be capable of generating a vast amount of multiple perspective visual data to reconstruct high fidelity 3D signals, needed to enable social intelligence that can decode every nuance of human expression.\r\n\r\nThe ability to discern subtle social signals (e.g., gaze following) can be computationally modeled by leveraging a massive camera system. The Social Signal Imaging System (SSIS) facilitates quantitative measurements of the social signals in 3D at unprecedented temporal and spatial resolutions. This development involves the following steps: (i) Design a distributed visual computing architecture to efficiently process the Multiview visual data streams; (ii) Build a new high-fidelity 3D representation of the view-invariant social signals (gaze, face, finger, body, appearance); (iii) Create a novel 3D dataset of social signals for use in discovering behavioral markers; and (iv) Develop new computer vision algorithms (recognition, matching, tracking, reconstruction) tailored to social signal imaging that minimize computational latency while maintaining accuracy.  The system provides a unique characterization of microscopic social signals that enable overcoming fundamental limitations of existing approaches in behavioral assessment of at-risk children. This work impacts diverse disciplines such as robotics, neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, and medicine. The outcomes will be disseminated through K-12 students from under-represented groups via workshops, machine learning and technology summer camps, and other activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
