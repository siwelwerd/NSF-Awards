 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies demonstrate that extracurricular student activities can play an important role in the ethical development of students; however, it is not known which specific kinds of activities are most effective and why. This award supports a research project that proposes to address this question by identifying engineering student organizations, as well as institutional mechanisms within these student organizations, that are effective in cultivating ethical behavior. It will also test the effectiveness of informal practices outside of the classroom in four student organizations. The results of this research will contribute to the increasing scholarship in engineering education which emphasizes ethical concerns, the importance of social justice, educating globally competent engineers and critical thinking by focusing on contexts outside of the classroom that contribute to cultivating ethical cultures in the field of engineering. They will also serve to create a community of practice with the goal of increasing the visibility of ethical engineering and knowledge sharing among scholars in the field of ethical STEM.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates the role that different student organizations play in cultivating ethical behavior of engineering student in the U.S. and to identify the precise institutional mechanisms within those organizations that foster ethical behavior. Research shows that students are typically less interested in understanding the ethical implications of their work at the end of their studies than they were at the beginning. This gap between instruction and application indicates a continued need for research to identify factors that are effective in cultivating a culture of ethical STEM and promoting an awareness and understanding of ethics among engineering students. The results from the proposed research will directly affect student organizations within the studied institutions and beyond. This study will involve a diversity of key players in these organizations including leadership, mentors, and members to open discussion regarding improving engineering ethics behavior. The project will also test the efficacy of interventions and create a set of guidelines for student organizations. This research promises to educate ethical engineers within and beyond the university, and it is expected to have positive impacts on the people and communities that are affected by engineering projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
