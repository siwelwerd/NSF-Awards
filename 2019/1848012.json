 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eric Neuscamman of the University of California, Berkeley is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop new theoretical models to describe molecules that are excited by the absorption of light.  Interactions with light are fundamental to chemistry.  Lasers, for example, play a central role in molecular diagnostics. The absorption of light and its conversion to electricity is central to solar power and to many of the sensory devices used to guard against chemical and biological threats. Scientists are still unable to answer many critical questions about the behavior of molecules that have absorbed light.  By constructing theoretical models to describe light-activated molecules, Neuscamman's research provides insights that complement and enhance experimental methods.  Neuscamman is also building a multi-level outreach and education effort.  His program uses learn-by-playing and learn-by-teaching principles to improve numerical optimization concepts and methods across K-12 education. This effort centers around the design and deployment of age-appropriate games, such as \"program your own virtual robot\" for high school students. A key feature of this outreach is vertical integration, in which older students, especially undergraduates and high school students, are recruited into the outreach efforts targeting younger students, thus enabling learning-by-teaching. Together, these efforts give students a head start in numerical methods thinking and real-world applications that prepare them for formal calculus training and provide them with the required mathematical skills for scientific endeavors. \r\n\r\nThe ground state variational principle is the single most important theoretical tool in quantum chemistry, allowing wave function approximations and their orbital shapes to be tailored for the ground state of a specific molecule.  Historically, the modeling of a large variety of chemical processes has been hampered by the lack of analogous tools for excited states.  Such excited states play central roles in understanding light harvesting, atmospheric processes, and energy storage.  Although quantum Monte Carlo methods are able to work directly with rigorous excited state variational principles, they have important limitations and do not, at present, benefit from the same quantum-Monte-Carlo/quantum-chemistry synergies that exist for ground states.  Professor Neuscamman is extending the advantages of excited state variational principles into the ecosystem of traditional quantum chemistry.  This project begins with an excited-state-specific mean field theory that is a direct generalization of Hartree Fock Theory. Professor Neuscamman is developing new excited state generalizations of correlation theories like M'ller Plesset theory and coupled cluster theory.  These methods act both as natural partners for Monte Carlo methods and as powerful tools in their own right.  In summary, Neuscamman's work generalizes excited state variational principles beyond the world of quantum Monte Carlo in order to bring traditional ground state quantum chemistry to bear on excited state problems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nKnowing what color a molecule is, in other words what wavelengths of light it absorbs, is central to understanding chemical phenomena such as photosynthesis and air pollution. While color can often be measured in a lab, it can be essential to predict colors via computer simulations for molecules that exist only very briefly or that scientists have not yet succeeded in making in the laboratory. The research supported by this grant has developed new and more effective approaches to these types of computer simulation.\n\n\nAt the heart of these simulations is the following question: how do the electrons within a molecule arrange themselves in space, and how does this arrangement change when light is absorbed? Over decades, very accurate methods have been built to answer this question in the absence of light by designing computer programs that seek to arrange electrons so as to minimize their energy. However, this approach, known as the variational principle, does not work straightforwardly after light has been absorbed, as the act of absorbing light pumps energy into the electrons and rearranges them!\n\n\nThe research supported by this grant has developed a new class of simulation techniques that continue to be applicable even after light has been absorbed. In particular, these new algorithms avoid relying on the assumption that key aspects of the arrangement are unchanged by light. This assumption, which is currently used in one form or another by all of the most widely used simulation techniques today, can be grossly incorrect in cases where the light causes one or more electrons to move to a different part of the molecule in a process known as charge transfer. The new algorithms developed under this grant can therefore improve scientists' ability to predict a molecule's color and how it will react in the presence of light even when a charge transfer rearrangement is likely.\n\n\nAlongside these research developments, this grant has supported the creation of a middle school outreach initiative that teaches key numerical simulation principles through gameplay. Each semester, graduate students travel to local middle schools to instruct students in the basics of numerical optimization and (sneakily) the importance of basic calculus concepts like slope and curvature. Numerical optimization techniques underpin the design of aircraft, pharmaceuticals, and the mapping and navigation software we use every day. By opening students' eyes to these connections and familiarizing them with the concepts through interactive treasure-hunting games, this outreach helps to improve student awareness of and preparedness for advanced opportunities in STEM.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/26/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: EricNeuscamman\n"
