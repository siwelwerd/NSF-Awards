 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Division of Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program award supports acquisition of three survey-grade unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for airborne topographic mapping, hardware and software for associated Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetric processing, and two Global Navigational Satellite System (GNSS) receivers and antennas for ground-based surveying.  The requested instrumentation will support faculty and student research and research training at the University of Alaska Southeast in Juneau, AK.  The investigators will engage students in hands-on experiential learning using the requested equipment and are active in public outreach discussing avalanche and glacial lake outburst flood hazards and the effects of changing climate on regional mountain glaciers.  The University of Alaska Southeast is a Native Alaskan serving institution and the PIs are active in outreach to Native Alaskans through extant University programs and through contact with the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida in Juneau. \r\n\r\nResearch projects that will take advantage of the UAVs for topographic mapping include process-based studies of glacier-ocean interactions, glacier lake outburst floods, sedimentation and erosion, and avalanche dynamics. Field areas will include the Mendenhall glacier, Mt. Juneau avalanche field, and Taku glacier, all located very close to the University but comprised of rugged and largely inaccessible terrain across Southeast Alaska.  The UAVs and related GNSS base stations will permit topographic surveys in this challenging terrain with unprecedented accuracy and speed to observe rapidly changing mountain glaciers, glacial lakes and avalanche prone areas in a safe manner and with direct implications for monitoring potential hazards and mitigating loss of life and infrastructure in the municipality of Juneau.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We purchased survey-grade UAVs that allow us to do airbourne topographic mapping. We also purchase Structure from Motion photogrammetric mapping software that allows us to process the UAV imagery. Finally, the GNSS receivers allow us to accurately survey ground control points to use with our photogrammetric software. This instrumentation package has been used for two primary purposes: 1) to enhance faculty research in the Environmental Science Program at the University of Alaska Southeast, and 2) to create a ?Drone Lab? to train undergraduate students on using UAVs for environmental mapping applications.</p>\n<p>The primary research use of the UAVs has been to survey Suicide Basin along the Mendenhall Glacier above Juneau. This basin has a large ice dam and is the source of annual glacier lake outburst floods that threaten infrastructure in the residential areas along the Mendenhall River that drains from the glacier. The UAVs have been used by faculty and students to survey the basin and document its evolution as the glacier continues to think and recede. In particular, we have used the maps created by the UAV surveys to calculate the volume of water stored in Suicide Basin. These water volume estimates for the basin are used as the inputs to flood models created by the National Weather Service that are used to forecast the timing and magnitude of downstream flood events in Juneau. Our studies of the Mendenhall Glacier outburst flood are described in a paper entitled ?Deglacierization of a marginal basin and implications for outburst floods, Mendenhall Glacier, Alaska? that was published in Frontiers in Earth Science in 2020.</p>\n<p>University of Alaska southeast faculty and students are also using UAVs to survey the terminus of the Mendenhall Glacier. The Mendenhall is the most visited glacier in North America, with more than 500,000 visitors per year. We are using drone imagery to document glacier retreat rates and create maps of glacier retreat that can be shared with visitors at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center. Finally, we are also using UAVs to survey potential landslide areas above Juneau. By creating digital topographic models from UAV imagery, we can assess the degree to which tensions cracks on steep slopes are widening and changing position over time.</p>\n<p>In addition to research, the UAVs, processing software, and GNSS units purchased with this award have been used extensively to train undergraduate students. University of Alaska Southeast faculty Eran Hood and Sanjay Pyare and postdoctoral fellow Christian Kienholz designed a field class entitled ?Using Drones for Environmental Monitoring? that is now offered annually in the Environmental Science program. This class has trained approximately 30 students on how to use UAVs for environmental monitoring applications. This training provides an extremely valuable sill set for upper division science students at the University of Alaska Southeast. The instrumentation from this award has allowed us to develop our Drone Lab and we plan on using the instruments to train and recruit students into the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/30/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Eran&nbsp;Hood</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1921598/1921598_10616183_1635572810178_mendenhallorthoimate--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1921598/1921598_10616183_1635572810178_mendenhallorthoimate--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mendenhall Glacier Terminus\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1921598/1921598_10616183_1635572810178_mendenhallorthoimate--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mendenhall Glacier Terminus\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Orthoimage of the Mendenhall Glacier terminus created using UAV imagery.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Eran Hood</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eran&nbsp;Hood</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mendenhall Glacier Terminus</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1921598/1921598_10616183_1635446201861_IMG_5017--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1921598/1921598_10616183_1635446201861_IMG_5017--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Drone-based glacier surveying in Alaska\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1921598/1921598_10616183_1635446201861_IMG_5017--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Drone-based glacier surveying in Alaska\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">University of Alaska Southeast undergraduate student Caitlyn Montalto flies a drone to survey the Mendenhall Glacier near Juneau Alaska.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Eran Hood</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eran&nbsp;Hood</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Drone-based glacier surveying in Alaska</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1921598/1921598_10616183_1635446317204_IMG_5394--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1921598/1921598_10616183_1635446317204_IMG_5394--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Drone-based landslide surveying in Alaska\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1921598/1921598_10616183_1635446317204_IMG_5394--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Drone-based landslide surveying in Alaska\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">University of Alaska Southeast undergraduate student Caitlyn Montalto flies a drone to survey a landslide hazard zone on a mountain ridge above the city of Juneau, Alaska.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Eran Hood</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eran&nbsp;Hood</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Drone-based landslide surveying in Alaska</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1921598/1921598_10616183_1635572929504_mendenhallterminusdronesurvey--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1921598/1921598_10616183_1635572929504_mendenhallterminusdronesurvey--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mendenhall Glacier Retreat Map\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1921598/1921598_10616183_1635572929504_mendenhallterminusdronesurvey--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mendenhall Glacier Retreat Map\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Map of changes in the position of the Mendenhall Glacier between 2020-2021.
