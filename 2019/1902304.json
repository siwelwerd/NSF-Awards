 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major hurdle to having more women researchers and professors in computer science is that many undergraduate women are simply not exposed to what computer science research entails or provided opportunities to explore as a career path.  This project will design and run the Tech+Research workshop, an all-female Computer Science research hackathon with the goal of highlighting the diversity and opportunities in the field of computing research.  The weekend event will be hosted in collaboration with Technica (https://gotechnica.org), the largest all-female hackathon.  Computing faculty from institutions across the state of Maryland will mentor groups of attendees on projects in their prospective research areas.  Along with providing hands-on research experience in a dynamic hackathon setting, Tech+Research will include sessions introducing attendees to the basics of computing research and highlight the exciting opportunities that come with pursuing a graduate degree in computer science.\r\n\r\nThis hackathon-centered approach to introducing students to research has the potential to be a low-overhead step towards a more equitable, inclusive field of computer science.  To measure its impact, this project will perform surveys and track the students' progress in their pursuit of Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) funding and graduate school.  Finally, this project will share its findings and materials to help foster similar workshops at other institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWomen are unfortunately underrepresented in Computer Science graduate programs and academic positions.  In our own experiences in recruiting undergraduates for research, we have observed that a far smaller number of undergraduate students&mdash;and especially women&mdash;pursue research opportunities than proportionally should be interested.  Based on personal interactions with our students, we believe this can be at least partially attributed to the fact that most students simply do not know what Computer Research is, nor what graduate school or a career in research would entail.\nThe primary objective of this project was to give female undergraduate students an opportunity to learn about future computer science research opportunities, to provide hands-on experience engaging in computer science research in a hackathon setting, and to ultimately increase the students\u2019 confidence in their ability to complete research needed for graduate study.\nThis grant funded Tech+Research, a weekend-long all-female \"research hackathon\" at the University of Maryland, in 2018 and 2019.  To further the marketing, scope, reach, and impact of the event, Tech+Research was held in conjunction with Technica, the nation\u2019s largest all-female hackathon, which is also held on campus at UMD.  Each year, hundreds of college, high school, and middle school women attend Technica.  We believe this helped to further create an empowering environment for the Tech+Research participants.\nTech+Research started with a day-long \"research bootcamp\" that introduced the women participants to Computer Science research&mdash;addressing topics such as what CS research is, an overview of the breadth of CS research areas, how research is performed, data analysis techniques (including hands-on exercises), how to perform research ethically, how to pursue graduate school if they so choose, and guest presentations from both graduate students and professors sharing why they chose to pursue a career in research.  The bulk of the workshop, however, comprised a two-day-long research hackathon, where student participants worked in groups on research projects defined and mentored by faculty and their graduate students.  At the end of the hackathon, the student groups presented their projects to judges and other Technica attendees.\nIn 2019 alone, 59 women and non-binary students participated, from 22 schools across 12 states (including Washington, D.C.) attended.  There were 9 projects from faculty across the University System of Maryland, spanning areas of artificial intelligence, data science, human computer interaction, data visualization, robotics, databases, and more.  In follow-up surveys, students reported feeling empowered and more confident in their abilities to perform research.  We are aware of at least half a dozen students performing research as a direct result of attending Tech+Research.  \nThe overall design of Tech+Research promotes increased involvement of women in Computer Science research, and is easily replicable at other institutions.  To help facilitate this, we maintain a public website of the event at https://inclusion.cs.umd.edu/events/techresearch\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David M Levin"
