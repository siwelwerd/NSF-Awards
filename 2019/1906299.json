 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovative research on the complex interaction of socio-economic and global environmental trends on biodiversity and ecosystem services is needed to help develop more informative scenarios for addressing environmental and human development challenges. Coupled natural-human systems; improved scenarios of biodiversity; and ecosystem services that integrate the outputs of both direct and indirect drivers such as land use change, invasive alien species, overexploitation, environmental change, pollution, and models of impacts of these drivers on biodiversity and ecosystem service are needed to overcome these challenges. This type of holistic approach provides a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments and environmental co-benefits of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This research builds on such methodology to examine the impact of sea ice loss in the Arctic on ecosystems and ecosystem services in Arctic coastal regions because these nearshore waters are among some of the most productive in the world. Goals of the US part of the project are to examine biodiversity and food web changes resulting from present and future changes in seasonal ice-covered and ice-free Arctic coasts. Field data will be augmented by high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery. Collaborators from other countries will be supported by their associated national funding agencies. Results of the study will be applied to evaluate habitat loss; the impact increased coastal erosion and sediment loads have on changes in nearshore bottom habitats and biodiversity; and the cascading effects of these processes on food webs.  Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration with Norway, Poland, Canada, and Denmark. The project will build bridges between countries and communities with interests in the Arctic; engage stakeholders ranging from local communities to national environmental protection agencies, including indigenous peoples; and develop a far-reaching and rich, public, data resource on Arctic systems impacted by sea ice loss that will be available to natural and social scientists across countries and disciplines. The project also sets a framework for sustainable socio-ecological management of Arctic coasts that could be important for the planning, construction, and sustainability of new infrastructure in the development of mineral, oil, gas, and other resources; the siting of potential new shipping lanes; and assessing/predicting changes in fisheries. Additional impacts of the project include the integration of science and education and training a postdoctoral scholar to become one of the next generation of international scholars.  The project also supports a researcher from a gender underrepresented in the sciences at an institution in an EPSCoR state (i.e., Alaska).\r\n\r\nThis award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on \"Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance as well as to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility, and fill gaps in knowledge. Funds support U.S. participants in a large international consortium of Danish, Polish, Canadian, US, and Norwegian scientists who seek to dramatically improve understanding of how the biodiversity of organisms in Arctic nearshore environments are impacted by the loss of sea ice. Participants in this effort from other countries are funded through their associated national funding organizations. Activities of the US scientists include providing food web and other physical measurements required to evaluate the consequences of sea ice loss on biodiversity as northern Arctic coastlines change from seasonal ice-covered to ice-free coasts.  Target species include primary marine producers such as macroalgae, microphytobenthos, phytoplankton, and ice algae.  Species will be analyzed for diversity and food-web connectivity to primary producers in both pelagic and benthic realms. Measurements of the physical and chemical characteristics of habitats will complement and provide context for the biological measures. International collaborators will use remote sensing with high-resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery to generalize results from local sites to be applicable the wider, geographical, pan-Arctic scale. Remotely sensed optical data of chlorophyll a (Chl a); total suspended sediment; colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM); and, where applicable, nearshore vegetation will be used to provide insights into the dynamic, spatial, and temporal variability of key food-web environmental parameters of Arctic coasts under different icing conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
