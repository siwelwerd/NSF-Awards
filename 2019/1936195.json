 "awd_abstract_narration": "Soils contain twice as much carbon (C) as other terrestrial sources. This subterranean C is mostly generated by plants and degraded by soil-dwelling microorganisms. The balance of plant input and microbial degradation determines how much C is stored below-ground versus released to the atmosphere. Plant-microbe interactions may therefore hold the key to mitigating C release into the atmosphere in a changing world. The environmental controls over how much C is stored in soil versus released to the atmosphere are unknown. This research leverages NSF-funded infrastructure that induced 30 years of continuous warming to understand how temperature affects plants and microorganisms, and the long-term soil C turnover that they mediate. The project will provide training opportunities for a laboratory technician as well as an early-career assistant professor, both female. In addition, the research will be integrated into the K-12 \"Biology in a Box\" program to create a module on below-ground plant-microbe interactions. The project has global importance as rising temperatures occur in ecosystems on earth. This research will enhance ecological forecasts and predictive models of ecosystem response at the global scale.\r\n\r\nMicrobial and ecosystem ecologists aim to connect shifts in plant and microbial community composition and physiology to subsequent changes in ecosystem functions such as C and nutrient cycling. Understanding long-term imprints of plant and microbial communities and associated soil C cycling under global change is paramount for predicting future global soil C stocks. By combining ecosystem-level measurements of soil C pools and fluxes with simultaneous measurements of plant physiology, abundance, and traits as well as microbial abundance, composition, and function in the longest continuously running soil warming experiment, this project will collect one of the most comprehensive data sets linking plant and microbial influence on soil C storage under global change. In addition, this research will use estimates of plant and microbial chemical fingerprints to detect their impacts on soil C pools and longevity in response to warming across soil depths. These data are necessary to project future soil C storage in a warmer climate. If microbial communities acclimate or adapt their genetic repertoire or functional gene expression rates under long-term warming, then short-term observations of microbial C cycling in response to warming are inadequate for forward projections of soil C stocks. Therefore, model projections of future soil C stocks that are predicated on short-term (5-10 year) microbial responses to warming likely predict larger C losses than may actually occur. Only by understanding the mechanisms controlling soil C cycling can we make accurate process-based ecosystem models of terrestrial C fluxes in the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
