 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site award to Middle Tennessee State University, located in Murfreesboro, TN, supports the training of 8 students for 9 weeks during the summers of 2020-2022. This program, funded by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research, engages undergraduate participants in research projects centered around X-ray characterization methods. X-ray crystallography is a technique that is used to identifying the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal.  The X-rays change direction on interacting with the atoms in the molecules. By measuring the angles and intensities of these \"diffracted\" x-ray beams, the researchers produce three-dimensional pictures of the molecules in the crystal.  While performing research under the guidance of faculty-mentors, participants interact during twice weekly activities that include technical workshops, professional development, social events, and field trips. Ultimately, the CRUX REU site advances chemical research while preparing a diverse group of participants for graduate school or STEM careers. \r\n\r\nParticipants pursue fundamental chemical research projects requiring synthesis of new materials and their characterization with analytical tools, including X-ray diffraction methods. Participants study materials including organic heterocycles with biological activity; non-precious metal organometallic catalysts; new semiconductor nanocrystals formed upon cation exchange; highly polar liquid crystals with boron cluster cores; and Clp proteins and their complexes. This site places an emphasis on recruiting underrepresented minority students and enhancing diversity in the STEM workforce. The associated workshops feature the theoretical basis for and practical aspects of X-ray data analysis.  Students also learn technical, data analysis, career-building and scientific communication skills.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The CRUX REU grant provided support for high-end research and research training in organic, inorganic, analytical and bio -chemistry at MTSU for 24 non-MTSU students from 18 states in all regions of the US. Each student participated in projects to synthesize new materials and analyze them using X-ray methods. Fifty-two publishable X-ray structures were obtained in connection with the research, and each student completed a 1 credit research course, a meeting abstract, a poster presentation, and a research report. One paper was published and five were in manuscript form when the final report was completed.&nbsp; Thirteen of the students have completed their BS degrees, 2 obtained MS degrees, 6 are in Ph.D. programs, 7 in jobs or searching, and the others are on track to graduate from their home institutions (HI). The HI of the participants were generally (82%) R2 or lower Carnegie ranking, which demonstrates that the CRUX-REU was successful at providing quality research experiences to students who had limited research opportunities.</p>\n<p><em>Broader Impacts.</em> Our goal was to expose a diverse cohort of undergraduate students to high-level research experience and career-building activities in preparation for a career in STEM. Overall, 24 undergraduates were involved in the research using X-ray methods of analysis in a productive learning environment. These participants continued in chemistry-related majors at their respective institutions or pursued MS or Ph.D. degrees following the REU experience. The CRUX REU program provided them with professional development experiences and confidence to succeed, as confirmed by the internal evaluator. The project also helped build research infrastructure for materials research through support of an NSF-funded X-ray diffractometer and a dedicated crystallographer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Intellectual Merit</em>. The students worked with seven experienced mentors and their research groups to synthesize new compounds or materials. These included several new stable benzotriazinyl radicals and diradicals, new ligands combined with 3 different metals for organometallic catalysts, fluorescent aurone dyes, liquid crystalline imines, piezoelectric metal oxide ceramics, melamine complexes, and CaO biodiesel catalysts. Biochemistry students focused on enzyme and biofilms structure. Each of these projects was built on preliminary results that allowed collection of publishable results in the short time duration of the REU. Participant contributions were summarized in poster presentations and detailed reports. These were refined for conference presentation and are included in several manuscripts in advanced stages, as well as the paper in publication. The single crystal and powder X-ray data provided deeper insight into the molecular and materials properties and added value to each project, while providing standalone options for publication.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/31/2023<br>\nModified by: Andrienne&nbsp;C&nbsp;Friedli</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852543/1852543_10603805_1704058603413_ks_syn_sideview--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852543/1852543_10603805_1704058603413_ks_syn_sideview--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"X-ray Structures\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1852543/1852543_10603805_1704058603413_ks_syn_sideview--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"X-ray Structures\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">X-ray analysis was the theme of the CRUX REU.
