 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forests are host to much of the world's biodiversity, and also provide many benefits to society, including the provisioning of clean air and water, opportunities for recreational activities such as hiking and the acquisition of valuable resources including timber and medicines.  Forests also provide a less-appreciated benefit to humans through the cycling of carbon dioxide (CO2) between the air and the trees. As humans add CO2 to the air through the combustion of fossil fuels for energy, the amount of carbon in the atmosphere accumulates. This extra CO2 in the air alters the natural greenhouse effect, and is changing temperature and weather conditions across the planet.  Part of the CO2 added to the air by human activities remains in the atmosphere, while some of it is absorbed by the oceans and land, especially by our vast forests.  As a result, forests currently provide an important mitigating effect for climate change, slowing the rate of change.  Seasonally snow-covered forests cover a large amount of land around the world, storing carbon in both the trees and soils. However, these areas are being modified by changing climate conditions and it is unclear how changes in snowpack will affect the ability of forests to store carbon. This project will investigate the unique influence of the snowpack on carbon cycling by using data collected across the northern hemisphere at research flux tower sites. The results of this project will advance scientific understanding of snow and tree interactions and will also be shared with the public through many activities at the Natural History Museum of Utah, allowing visitors to engage with and ask questions about the project. \r\n\r\n\r\nForests play a critical role in the global carbon cycle, exchanging large quantities of carbon with the atmosphere.  World ecosystems release an order of magnitude more CO2 to the atmosphere via respiration on an annual basis than humans do via combustion of fossil fuels and land use change.  However, forests remove just a bit more CO2 via photosynthesis than they release via respiration, and the annual net uptake of CO2 by land ecosystems is smaller than the human CO2 production.  This provides an important mitigating benefit to the rate of atmospheric CO2 increase and associated climate change.  However, there are many uncertainties about forest carbon cycling that prevent robust forecasts of ecological processes into the future.  This project will provide mechanistic insight into carbon cycling in snow-covered forests worldwide.  The project will investigate the role of snowpack in forest carbon cycling to uncover the mechanisms behind both direct biophysical and indirect controls that reflect cross-season biophysical and biogeochemical legacies.  Nearly 600 site years of carbon cycle data at over 60 unique seasonally snow-covered forests available from the worldwide FLUXNET and Fluxnet-Canada flux tower networks will be used.  These sites represent a broad range of climate conditions and will provide fundamental information on the controls of snow-mediated carbon cycle processes across seasonally snow-covered forests globally. This information is crucial for the advancement of terrestrial biosphere models, improving our understanding of carbon flux response in seasonally snow-covered ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIn this project we investigated the unique influence of the snowpack on carbon cycling of world forests. We tested a suite of hypotheses about the role of the snowpack in ecosystem carbon cycling. These hypotheses have helped elucidate the mechanisms behind 1) direct biophysical controls and 2) indirect controls that reflect cross-season biophysical and biogeochemical legacies. We used nearly 600 site years of carbon cycle data in seasonally snow-covered forests available from the worldwide FLUXNET2015, AmeriFlux, and Warm Winter 2020 flux tower networks. The sites cover very broad ranges of climate.\n\n\nWe used records of forest-atmosphere carbon dioxide exchange and weather to determine when photosynthesis begins and ends each year in 46 northern hemisphere forests. We used observations of soil temperature to determine the timing of the end of the snowmelt period. We found that evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF) began photosynthesis ~3 weeks before snowmelt ended, while deciduous broadleaf forests (DBF) waited until ~4 weeks after snowmelt ended. The DBF type ramped up photosynthesis in spring, and ramped down in autumn, faster than the ENF, and the length of the photosynthesis (or \"growing\") season was ~ 50 d shorter for DBF forests.\n\n\nAbundant evidence suggests that spring is occurring earlier in recent decades. We checked whether these forests are starting photosynthesis earlier by looking at forests with long-term records. We found minimal support for changes in photosynthetic phenology over time, but very strong connections between temperature and the timing of spring and autumn transitions.\n\n\nWe tested 19 models that use weather data to predict plant phenological events. We used gridded weather data to drive the models, and the best models were able to predict the spring and autumn photosynthetic transitions to within ~10 days.\n\n\nWe studied the response of forest gross primary productivity (GPP) during the photosynthetically active season to interannual and spatial variability in snow water equivalent (SWE), timing of snowmelt, and length of the active season. We combined carbon flux and weather data from 14 temperate deciduous and evergreen forests in the US and southeast Canada with SWE and precipitation from the Snow Data Assimilation System to test these hypotheses: 1) earlier snowmelt leads to a longer active season; 2) a longer active season is associated with higher total GPP, and 3) GPP during the active season is dependent on peak SWE and timing of snowmelt the previous winter.\n\n\nWe found that active season length was negatively correlated with total active season GPP in forests with drier summers on average (based on mean annual summer climatic water deficit), but positively correlated in areas with typically wetter summers. The magnitude of these effects decreased at forests with a higher percentage of annual precipitation falling as snow. Our results showed that the capacity for plants to gain more carbon during a longer active season appears to be dependent on soil water status determined by long-term climate, rather than interannual fluctuations in weather. We found no evidence that the magnitude of total snowfall or peak SWE had a legacy effect on subsequent active season GPP.\n\n\nFinally, we worked with the Natural History Museum of Utah in Salt Lake City to design a new permanent interactive exhibit on climate change. This exhibit is now open to the public.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/08/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DavidRBowling\n"
