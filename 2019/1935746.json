 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM 2019) will be held in Waikoloa on the Big Island, Hawaii, USA, during 9 -13 December 2019. This preeminent technical conference is one of the two flagship conferences of the IEEE Communications Society, and a primary venue for presenting new research results in the area of communications and networking. It is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field. Attending conferences such as Globecom is of paramount importance for the development of graduate and undergraduate students. Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of other leading-edge researchers in the field.\r\n \r\nThis proposal provides travel support for approximately sixteen graduate and undergraduate students in the United States to attend this premiere conference. The travel awards will give priority considerations to first-time attendees and under-represented minority students, since attending conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds. The research community and the Engineering workforce benefit from the improvement of students in the pipeline, and the introduction of new researcher perspectives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
