 "awd_abstract_narration": "The workshop entitled, \"Formulation Science and Engineering for the Common Good\" will be held during November of 2019 in Orlando, Florida. The workshop focuses on highlighting both the science and engineering aspects of formulation. Formulated products are multi-component chemical systems that are designed to meet specific requirements, and they are important for a broad range of industries such as food, personal care, and pharmaceuticals. Formulations exhibit interesting structures and properties based on the proportion of components including long chain molecules and particulate matter. This workshop brings together university researchers and industry engineers to discuss and exchange the latest ideas in the field and to foster future collaborations. The forum also serves as a platform to educate young researchers about professional development and carrier opportunities in this field. \r\n\r\nThe workshop program includes keynote lectures that offer expert views on the current state-of-the-art in formulations research and development.  The keynotes are followed by panel discussions on key themes such as emerging trends, data-driven approaches, computational tools, and challenges and opportunities for formulation-related research. The long-term objective of this workshop is to foster multidisciplinary and collaborative approaches toward formulations research that could prove transformative towards achieving desired societal outcomes in terms of health and environment. A report will be prepared at the end of the workshop that will include a summary of the workshop findings and a discussion of major opportunities in the formulations field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
