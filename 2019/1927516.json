Changes in sea level, extreme rainfall, heat extremes, and winter temperatures are already affecting the performance and integrity of transportation infrastructure around the world. These changes have serious ramifications for infrastructure safety, environmental sustainability, economic vitality, mobility and system reliability, particularly for vulnerable populations and urban locations. They also compromise resilience of the larger interconnected physical, cyber, and social infrastructure networks. Increasing resilience of transportation infrastructure to current and future weather and climate extremes is a global challenge. The complexity of this challenge requires a convergence approach to foster collaboration and innovation among technically and socially diverse researchers and practitioners. To address this challenge, this project will create a multi-institution ICNet Global Network of Networks that unites domestic and international research and practice networks to facilitate integrated engineering, climate science, and policy research that can advance the development of resilient transportation infrastructure and systems. The project's PIs and key collaborators represent networks based in Korea, Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States that have the maturity, size, complementary foci, and bandwidth necessary to jumpstart this catalytic level network of networks. ICNet Global will link researchers at the forefront of scientific, engineering, and policy research frontiers, drawing expertise from many disciplines and nations to share and enhance best practices for transportation resilience.\r\n\r\nICNet Global's long-term mission is to prepare the world's existing and future transportation infrastructure for a changing climate. To that end, ICNet Global will: (1) build a network of existing research networks that are tackling the challenges climate change poses to transportation infrastructure; (2) establish a common base-level knowledge, capacity, and vision to support the convergence of novel and diverse ideas, approaches, and technologies for creating climate resilient transportation infrastructure; and (3) grow the next generation of critical and diverse thinkers with the expertise to address and solve climate-related infrastructure challenges. Key activities for achieving these goals include network mapping and engagement (both in-person and virtual); convergence and training webinars; education and training material collation; and next generation mentoring. ICNet Global will link the institutional networks needed to accelerate and advance methods for making global transportation infrastructure resilient to a changing climate. It will also advance the science of resilient infrastructure design and will bring together different research and practice communities (e.g., climate scientists, engineers, policy makers) to develop a new global community of research and practice capable of engaging in community-based participatory research. By creating a space to connect, share information and learn from one another, ICNet Global will advance innovation in the field of resilient infrastructure design while helping to grow and sustain individual participating networks. The knowledge-linking strategies explored through ICNet Global will build conduits among researchers and practitioners responsible for transportation infrastructure standards and policies, and will help identify approaches transferable to other countries and challenges. ICNet Global will work with its partners' established diversity programs, such as those at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, to broaden participation of underrepresented groups as it advances the next generation of researchers. ICNet Global will also provide opportunities for, and already reflects in its leadership and members, early career scholars and women in engineering and science.\r\n\r\nThe Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) program is designed to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and prepare the next generation of U.S. researchers for multiteam international collaborations.  The AccelNet program supports strategic linkages among U.S. research networks and complementary networks abroad that will leverage research and educational resources to tackle grand scientific challenges that require significant coordinated international efforts. This project is co-funded by the Environmental Sustainability (ENG/CBET) program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
