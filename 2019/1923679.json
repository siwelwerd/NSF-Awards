The 15th ISBRA will be held in Barcelona, Spain in June.  A distinguished set of international leaders will provide the keynotes and the students will have an opportunity to present their research in posters sessions. The funds will provide for student travel support for participation in the  technical program as well as in tutorials and poster sessions.  Extended abstracts are published by Springer-Verlag and full papers will be published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.\r\n\r\nThe interface between computer science and the biological sciences has been one of the most fruitful areas of interdisciplinary research.  The current ISBRA meeting will provide an opportunity for students to meet in a variety of situations with both colleagues and world leaders and enhance overall professional development for the next generation of scientific leaders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
