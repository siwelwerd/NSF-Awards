 "awd_abstract_narration": "STEM Training in Ethics of Publication Practices (STEPP) is a research and training program that prepares STEM scholars and other key stakeholders to navigate a scholarly publishing terrain that presents more options than ever before, but also greater ethical pitfalls. It addresses the critical need for greater understanding of predatory publishing - an exploitive publication business model often involving charging publication fees to authors without checking articles for quality and legitimacy. Predatory publication practices cause concern because the core of the academic mission - to generate credible knowledge - is only fully realized through ethically sound communication of this knowledge, both to peer scholars and society at large. The STEPP program deepens understanding of the ethical challenges arising from predatory publishing through empirical research that solicits input from key stakeholders, including emerging and established scientists, administrators who serve as gatekeepers in academic hiring, tenure and promotion, and science journalists responsible for ensuring that the public receives accurate reporting on scientific research. The training component then designs, delivers, and assesses a program that is broadly relevant across the STEM disciplines but that can also be customized according to differences across these disciplines. Training modules will be pilot tested, and final versions will be made available to a diverse global audience through partnerships with organizations such as the Online Ethics Center for Engineering & Science, Think. Check. Submit., and Author Aid.\r\n\r\nSTEM Training in Ethics of Publication Practices (STEPP) is a research and training program that prepares scholars and other stakeholders to better operate within the current publishing environment, which is often characterized by predatory publishing practices. Phase 1 involves a comprehensive review of other individuals' or organizations' previous efforts to develop whitelists, blacklists, guidelines, or ethical codes intended to help authors navigate the current, ethically fraught terrain of predatory publishing. The goal of this thematic analysis is to identify and synthesize common points and major differences among these initiatives. Phase 2 involves interviewing key stakeholder groups to enhance understanding of the challenges and the culture surrounding ethical dimensions of scholarly publishing in STEM disciplines. The goal is to ascertain stakeholders' understanding and awareness of existing lists, criteria, and standards examined in Phase 1, and the ways in which participants have previously consulted or employed such resources, if at all. Phase 3 entails developing a training program to be made available online to communicate the results to various stakeholders who can apply this knowledge to the everyday challenges they face in pursuing publication opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
