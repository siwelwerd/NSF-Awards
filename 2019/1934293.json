 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) proposes to host a second convening of key stakeholders engaged in and committed to improving Computer Science education for Native students. The first convening, held in March of 2019, focused primarily on understanding challenges and identifying areas for improvement by convening a small group of stakeholders. Based on the responses of those participants, AISES proposes to advance the effort by engaging an expanded set of stakeholders to not only identify barriers but to begin developing solutions, building networks, and realizing resources both by connecting those with limited access and by creating new, more appropriate resources to meet the needs of Native students and Native-serving teachers and schools. \r\n\r\nThis second convening will take place October 13-14, 2019, immediately following the 2019 AISES National Conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. AISES will recruit convening attendees, targeting key stakeholders, previous attendees, and conducting outreach to its networks and extending invitations to partner networks. The objectives of the proposed convening are to: (1) expand the set of engaged participants to include additional teachers and administrators, representatives of CS education non-profit organizations, and other members of the tribal education community and (2) develop detailed plans of action and create a road map for implementation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To further our understanding of how to best prepare and engage Native students in computer science and the technology-driven fields of STEM, AISES hosted two convenings attended by a diverse group of stakeholders committed to increasing access to and improving CS education for Native students. The focus of the convenings were to create unique opportunities to bring together different types of stakeholders to engage in dialogue, networking, and consensus building, creating novel partnerships that might otherwise be difficult to achieve. The purpose of the 2nd convening held March 7-8, 2019, in Sulphur Oklahoma, was to better understand the needs, challenges, and current best practices of Native communities and Native-serving educational institutions in providing high quality and timely CS education to Native students. Additionally, this Convening proposed to provide an overview of NSF opportunities and identify technical assistance needs to facilitate greater participation in NSF programs among tribes, Native-serving institutions, and Native education researchers. \n \nThe impact of the first Convening was based upon ten outcomes that were thoughtfully derived from a rationale that identified the importance of creating opportunities for dialogue and collaboration with novel partnerships in the pursuit of CS educational opportunities for Native students. By the end of the second Convening, three action items were discussed: 1) Making Value Propositions Clear; 2) Managing Resources; 3) Activating AISES Professionals. \n \nEight strong themes of CS education for Native students were identified during the convenings. The themes included: the digital divide; language usage and terminology; accessibility to CS/STEM curricula; the need for community support; technical training and assistance for teachers; issues surrounding funding and costs; college and career readiness; and industry and corporate roles/support. Sub-topics were identified and allowed for a more robust understanding of the challenges associated with each theme. During the second convening, three action items were developed to address how to actualize the themes: Making Value Propositions Clear, Managing Resources, and Activating AISES Professionals. \n \nBoth Convenings and their impact on CS education across Indian Country is timely and critical to current discussions around economic opportunities and workforce development for Native communities, the digital divide experienced on and off tribal lands, and the increasingly urgent need to prepare Native students for technology-driven higher education and careers. With a growing population of young Natives and the current infrastructure and workforce needs of tribal communities, CS education is at the forefront of planning and action among tribal communities and Native organizations, like AISES.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kathy Deerinwater"
