 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will conduct Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning-Physical Chemistry Laboratory (POGIL-PCL) workshops for faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students. These workshops will be held around the country at a variety of higher education institutions. Additionally, there will be ongoing development of POGIL-PCL experiments, which will serve to engage returning and new faculty participants in sustaining the project. Student learning outcomes resulting from use of POGIL-PCL materials in the laboratory will be examined. Ultimately, the use of evidence-based student-centered active learning in the laboratory will be analyzed and promoted and the learning that students achieve in an active-learning laboratory setting will be characterized.\r\n\r\nThe project will examine the impact a connected community of faculty has on the sustained implementation of this methodology. The project will use social network theory to describe how the adoption of materials is affected by sustained interactions among faculty members after their initial introduction at a workshop.  A broad range of institutions will be engaged to reach new and established faculty, and to provide professional development opportunities for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.  Knowledge surveys coupled to think-aloud interviews and adaptations of published instruments will be used to answer questions regarding students' perception of their learning and their understanding of physical chemistry phenomena as a function of participating in POGIL-PCL experiments.  Faculty teaching will be observed and characterized on the basis of facilitation and student engagement.  The survey and observational data will be analyzed, in part, through the lens of a theoretical framework for coordination of theory and evidence.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe student outcomes component of the \"POGIL-PCL: Student learning in the laboratory through sustained faculty development\" aimed to investigate how undergraduate students perceive their learning in physical chemistry laboratory environments with various levels of implementation of inquiry-based physical chemistry laboratory experiments, how the facilitation affected these learning environments, and what the nature of students' content knowledge related to the phenomena targeted by the laboratory experiments was.\n\nRelatively few studies examine, in detail, students' learning experiences in upper-division undergraduate laboratory environments.  This project helped address this knowledge gap.  A manuscript related to the following findings is currently in preparation:\n\nResearchers      analyzed video and audio-recorded observations  using existing,      validated observation protocol from the research literature used to      characterize instructor and student behaviors in undergraduate laboratory environments.       It was found that the implementation of a computational chemistry      laboratory experiment elicited the most \"analytical\" discussion      among students while a spectroscopy experiment that was more \"wet lab      intensive\" elicited the most \"experimental\" discussion      among students\nStudents      in a laboratory environment in which the POGIL-PCL experiments were      facilitated by an experienced instructor who was highly committed to the      proper implementation of the laboratory activities scored significantly      higher on knowledge survey questions targeting the relevant content than      those who were not in this environment.\n\n\nAn inquiry-based experiment that was implemented in multiple POGIL-PCL laboratory environments was published by some members of the research team (including the PI) and their collaborators in Journal of Chemical Education in late 2020 (J. Chem. Educ. 2020, 97(12) 4475 - 4481).  The experiment focused on several important process (procedural) objectives (e.g. performing non-linear regression to obtain useful parameters) and content (directly related to the relevant physical chemistry content knowledge) objectives (e.g. understanding enzyme kinetics) and was in the context of measuring the rate of browning of fruits (specifically apples) - a practical application of physical chemistry principles.\n\nThe manuscript includes example data generated by students, outcomes based on lab reports, and implications for implementation and facilitation of this experiment in any physical chemistry teaching laboratory environment.\n\nBy investigating how students learn in inquiry-oriented upper-division laboratory environment, this project contributed to the advancement of the chemistry education research discipline.  It also produced results that are important for bridging the research-to-practice gap such as identifying how student discourse shifts depending on the nature of the laboratory experiment (implying that instructors should be intentional about focusing on students' discussion of underlying concepts - especially during laboratory experiments that have a significant \"in-lab\" component). \n\nWhile all the results will eventually be disseminated to the broader research community, it is important to note that many of the results described above were presented to POGIL-PCL instructors at developer and implemenation workshops (thus contributing to the broader impacts of the work).\n\nSeveral undergraduate students and a postdoctoral fellow also had the opportunity to work on the project.  Many of these individuals are from under-represented background in STEM; this also contributed to the broader impacts associated with this project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/21/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marc N Muniz"
