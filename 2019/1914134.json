 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project is focused on developing a mobile biotech laboratory for high schools. Education in biotech is limited from a practical point of view to schools with the funds to purchase expensive equipment and to train their teachers to use it. Kits including equipment and accompanying instructional materials are available in large biotech markets but require teacher training, purchase of materials and check-out and return of equipment. In this, instruction is limited to a few high schools in key biotech hubs. Our goal is to give every student in the country equal access to biotech training by building a laboratory in their pocket through the proposed product. Through use of mobile devices, a $100 tablet can replace thousands of dollars in laboratory equipment. Everything the student needs to complete their studies will be included in the app or through in-app purchases. Teacher training would be minimal because back-end validation of all reagent kits and accompanying gear is completed to make its use seamless and universally applicable. All accompanying information required for the teacher is provided including in-App assessment tools of student performance. The app may be downloaded by anyone in the country and gear/reagents rapidly shipped directly to the teacher?s classroom. Teachers in rural communities will have the same access as teachers in the wealthiest school districts. \r\n\r\nThe project will focus on developing a web-based app with a back-end database that teaches hands-on biotech laboratory skills and concepts via discovery-based learning. The app includes an exploration lab module that simulates high-end scientific equipment, including a spectrophotometer and microscope that use the smart-phone camera. A second module takes students through various laboratory skills including micropipetting, use of microscope, and spectrophotometer. Students learn background and are led through practice and research activities resulting in a report. A third module uses guided discovery-based learning approaches to take students through the scientific method to a real-world research problem and adheres to all three dimensions of Next Generation Science Standards. Unit includes a study of milk digestion by the pancreas that features isolation of pancreatic proteases, drug discovery/natural product screening and quality control testing of commercially available enzyme supplements. In these explorations, students are not given answers. They must formulate hypothesis and do guided background research and ultimately perform hands-on experiments resulting in a final report. Student progress is captured in a back-end database and monitored by their instructor. Hardware such as micropipettes and attachments for phone/tablet will be designed and prepared through 3D printing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is an independent study program that does not require a trained science teacher in the room.&nbsp; The program consists of: (1) A web-application (XplorStem Academy), (2) A hands-on laboratory that has been reduced to practice using only reagents safe to use in a home environment, and (3) A custom designed piece of scientific equipment.</p>\n<p>During Phase I, we built a minimum viable product that encompasses all three aspects of the program. This includes a full K-6 program online program with a hands-on laboratory and off-line activity books. New patentable methods and hands-on laboratories were developed for middle and high school. All three programs allow students to relive historic scientific discoveries. Students in K-6 reproduce the historic discovery of chlorophyll, middle school students reproduce understanding of the molecular structure of gallstones and high school students, the discovery of the first enzyme. Throughout, students are gaining important laboratory skills while learning key scientific concepts, how to make scientific observations and the scientific method.

The centrifuge performs to industry standards. While spinning, it achieves a force of 150-200 times the force of gravity. This force is sufficient to carry out most routine scientific separations while remaining safe for very young children to use unsupervised. In testing, the centrifuge was very popular. Children played with it for hours separating solutions found around their home and backyard.

In the sciences, research suggests that biology is considered an easier subject than chemistry or physics because it is more relatable to everyday life.

XplorStems science education approach and philosophy embody wonder-based education. Students watch a video of a phenomenon: They Encounter it. Then, they make a bold guess or hypothesis to explain the phenomenon based upon the information they have at hand. They Investigate it and Discover more about the phenomenon through Research. Knowledge is Propagated through a hands-on experiment where students experience concepts related to the phenomenon.

The focus of the program is to democratize access to a high-quality science education despite socioeconomic status. As such, we are sparking an interest in science for underserved communities thereby expanding and increasing the STEM workforce. We teach critical hands-on laboratory skills providing career readiness and drug discovery training without the need for a trained science teacher in the room. A specific aim of the program was to develop laboratories and equipment that are low cost to produce so the program can be offered at an affordable price. For areas of the country without high-speed internet, the programs may be easily adapted to be off-line. Instruction can occur through workbooks that guide students through the scientific method and hands-on experiments. Equipment developed is all manually powered and does not require a specialized laboratory setting. In fact, it is designed to travel with students and encourage exploration outside of the classroom. Our products and approach engage youth in science from an early age and transition to career readiness training as students grow. Students gain hands-on laboratory experience safely and without the need for a science teacher in the room. This has the potential to transform lives and fill the pipeline with heretofore untapped technical talent. This will grow our economy and continue to provide the technical advances that improve lives and maintain our competitiveness in the world.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Vicki&nbsp;Meadows</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1914134/1914134_10616118_1632927273396_Summary_of_online_application--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1914134/1914134_10616118_1632927273396_Summary_of_online_application--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Summary of Student Journey Through the Application\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1914134/1914134_10616118_1632927273396_Summary_of_online_application--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Summary of Student Journey Through the Application\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student journey through the XplorStem online program.
