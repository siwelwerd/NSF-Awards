 "awd_abstract_narration": "The participation of underrepresented students in mathematical sciences doctoral programs is an issue of national concern. MORE: Mathematics - Opportunities in Research and Education is a new, annual workshop designed to increase the number of these students who pursue graduate degrees in mathematics; develop a peer network for support in continuing education and career goals; and equip participants with strategies to increase retention among those who enter graduate programs in the mathematical sciences. This is achieved through a unique active workshop format engaging students in highly relevant mathematics tied to applications that address societal needs. MORE specifically targets and prioritizes the participation of female, minoritized, and/or first-generation college students, involves them mathematics via experiential learning in a collaborative setting, establishes a peer/mentor community, and provides them with insight on and support for mathematical graduate experiences. The MORE workshop gives participants strength in numbers in ways that mobile their collective promise in mathematics, thus leading to a better qualified and more diverse workforce.\r\n\r\nThe MORE: Mathematics - Opportunities in Research and Education conference serves as an early professional development and community-building opportunity for undergraduate mathematical sciences majors.  The target audience for the workshop includes women, first-generation college students, and students traditionally under-represented in the mathematical sciences. In addition to helping students build a peer mentoring network, the workshop will introduce students to current research questions introduced by two topical plenary speakers.  These presentations will be followed by working group sessions, where students advance the research question through guided discussion and exploration led by graduate students. Topics are selected for their timeliness and accessibility. Panels and other activities are arranged to demystify the graduate school experience. Graduate students assisting in cooperative breakout sessions will receive mentor training, providing them with translational skills. MORE also provides materials to a larger audience through its Get MORE page, which highlights upcoming opportunities of interest, and the SEGS: Success and Enrichment in Graduate School page, which focuses on topics that are tied to documented barriers to success for the target group of participants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
