This conference will encourage interactions between researchers from physics, mechanics, engineering science, chemistry, material science, biology, mathematics, and computational science and engineering working on the fundamental science and applications in multifunctional materials.\r\n\r\nThe participants will attend focused lectures that include a guided discussion period and will present posters. The technical sessions will cover the following topics: Materials of Architected Topology, Biological, Biomolecular and Bioinspired Materials for Sensing, Structural Remodeling and Morphogenesis, Brain-inspired Neuromorphic Networks, Structural Power, Avian Inspired Morphing Systems, Metastructures for Dynamic Response Tailoring, Reconfigurable Soft Robotics, and Multimaterial Additive Manufacturing. This project will facilitate the interaction of scholars from the variety of disciplines to address the fundamental scientific issues underpinning the advancement of hierarchical multifunctional material systems from the molecular scale to the macroscopic structural scale, and will provide an environment to promote networking and the formation of collaborative research endeavors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
