 "awd_abstract_narration": "With humanity continuing to explore last frontiers of the new Arctic and Antarctic, polar nations invest heavily in improving navigation satellite coverage of this region. In this context, the ionized portion of the upper atmosphere (ionosphere) at polar latitudes represents an important piece of the puzzle, since it is the medium through which the satellite radio signal travels and since it is known to contain strong disturbances. This award provides support for a comprehensive investigation into unexpected plasma density enhancements at polar latitudes called sporadic-F. The focus of the investigation is on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations of sporadic-F. Navigation satellites often experience degradation of radio signal quality and sporadic F has been demonstrated to be one of the leading causes. Opening of Arctic to shipping traffic as the ice cap melts and an ever-increasing number of transpolar flights make this investigation particularly timely due to its potential to characterize occurrence and identify mechanisms for GNSS signal loss. \r\n\r\nThis investigation will validate a recent set of satellite observations that fly in the face of conventional wisdom and past expectations based on decades of northern hemisphere data analysis. The validation will utilize ground-based observations in both hemispheres and first-principles modeling. It is well-known that sporadic-F is controlled by magnetospheric forcings (convection and precipitation), and it has been hypothesized that thermospheric variations may also be important. Therefore, new insights into the characteristics of those systems (magnetosphere and thermosphere) are expected. To aid in mapping and understanding dynamic high-latitude plasma flows, the state-of-the-art Lagrangian coherent structure analysis code will be used and developed. This work has the potential to transform the understanding of a phenomenon that has been the subject of extensive study since its discovery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this project was to better understand why patches of ionospheric plasma are observed more in both polar zones in January despite it being southern hemisphere summer.  The upper atmosphere from about 100-500 km contains positively charged ions and free electrons because ultraviolet light from the sun frees electrons from some of the neutral atmosphere particles.  The layer of atmospheric charged particles is known as the ionosphere.  The ionosphere has more charged particles (plasma) on the sunlit side. Sometimes some of the daytime plasma gets pulled toward and over the magnetic poles to the nightside, in the chunks called \"patches.\"  Polar cap patches can cause twinkling of radio signals we use, such as those of communications signals or Global Positioning System (GPS).  For GPS users scintillation can be a problem because if a satellite appears to go \"dark\" temporarily, the user\u2019s GPS position can become inaccurate or even temporarily impossible to provide.\n\n\nThis study investigated whether and why more patches seem to occur at both poles when the north pole is tilted away from the sun (January, near the December solstice) than when the south pole is tilted more away from the sun (July, near the June solstice).  The team used observations to show that the plasma patchiness does indeed appear to be higher in both hemispheres in January.  This is surprising for the south pole because January is summer there, when it would be more daylit at the pole.  We also used models to study which effects were important for plasma and patch movement.  The key factors considered were neutral wind, composition, and electric field effects.  Finally, we used the model outputs to define the channels where plasma was confined to flow (or not), due to fluid barriers inherent in the plasma flow.\n\n\nKey outcomes\nAs a result of this effort, fluid coherent structures in the ionosphere were identified over two months of model outputs, January and July 2014.  The January results indicate that a coherent structure (a flow barrier) in the high-latitude ionosphere gets broken down when neutral atmosphere effects are taken into account.  This indicates that the neutral wind effects at low and mid-latitudes can be important in determining where high latitude plasma does or does not end up being able to travel.\n\n\nThis project supported two women graduate students.
