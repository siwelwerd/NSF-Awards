 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the organization of a workshop on Energy Storage: Frontiers of Materials, Architectures, and Techniques. The workshop will be held in the Reno, NV/Lake Tahoe, CA area in March 2020, and it is expected that there will be about 150 attendees. The workshop will take place over one-and-a-half days and will include interactive sessions and a poster session to explore and define current critical \"Big Science Questions\" in electrochemical energy storage. The energy content of commercial lithium ion battery systems has been increasing in an incremental, evolutionary manner. To achieve break-out advances, new paradigms are required that are separate from established technologies such as ceramic high energy cathodes and graphite-based anodes electrodes. These new component improvements will enable higher performance energy storage systems that help increase the capacity of intermittent renewable energy electricity generation by solar and wind and increase the performance of electric and hybrid electric vehicles. \r\n\r\nThe workshop has eight planned topic sessions so that all the participants will have the opportunity to contribute their views on key future research directions. The structure will use a Topic Chair, invited speakers, and breakout discussion model for each topic. Topics planned are Industrial Perspectives, Li and Na Metal Batteries, Solid State Electrolyte Batteries, Emerging Li-Ion Cathodes, Hybridized Battery-Capacitors and Fast-Charge Systems, Redox Flow Batteries, Nonaqueous Beyond Li Batteries, and Aqueous Beyond Li Batteries. The organization of the workshop is designed so that a diversity of researchers from academia, national laboratories, and industry can participate in a collaborative environment. The workshop will be explicitly structured to attract the widest possible cross-section of individuals with travel grants to support graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early-career academic investigators. The outcome of the workshop will be a publicly available white paper.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
