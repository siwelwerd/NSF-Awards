 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compared to other animals, humans have evolved far more complex cultures and much greater reliance on teaching as a means of transmitting information. Scientists debate competing evolutionary explanations for these divergences, and a promising theoretical avenue emphasizes links between these traits and human life history traits: long juvenile periods and lifespans, cooperative childcare, and large relative brain size.  In this project, researchers will study age-related changes in how a non-human primate species (capuchins) invents new behaviors and acquires behaviors from others in the wild. Because capuchins have independently evolved a less extreme version of the human life history pattern (e.g., slow development, long lifespans, large brains for body size, and prolonged co-residence with a variety of caregiving relatives), they can generate insights into the role of life history traits in promoting particular types of social learning. This research project will also include a number of training and science education activities. The research team will provide fieldwork opportunities and mentoring, and consequently enhanced prospects for admission to graduate school, to approximately 12 young scientists; involve high school students in data analysis; and make presentations about scientific methods and tropical forest conservation to schools near the research site. Researchers will also collaborate with videographers and with local environmental educators to produce materials to inspire students to study, appreciate, and conserve the highly endangered tropical dry forests.\r\n\r\nHumans uniquely exhibit cumulative cultural evolution proposed to stem from factors including long juvenile periods that enable learning, intergenerational transmission of knowledge, cooperate care of offspring that further facilitates learning, and theory of mind. Theoretical models, and empirical work in developmental psychology, suggest that the tradeoff between trial-and-error learning and social learning, as well as the tradeoff between creativity and sticking to tried-and-true solutions, shift over the life course. However, in order to test theoretical models used to explain these findings in humans, researchers need non-human primate comparative data about the emergence and spread of new behavioral variants and the effects of population age structure on the social transmission of new ideas. Data will be collected in the Lomas Barbudal Monkey Project, now in its 30th consecutive year. Data on genetic kinship, including grandparent-grandoffspring relationships, are available for ten social groups. Focal animal behavioral sampling will focus on the oldest and youngest animals and will include (besides routine recording of social interactions and object handling) gaze monitoring, infant-alloparent communication, and instances of joint attention to objects.  Group scans will document the social network structure. Data from all group members will be used to document flexibility in solving two of the most difficult foraging tasks in the behavioral repertoire, and any behavioral innovations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

White-faced capuchins and humans have independently evolved long life spans, slow development, large brain size, cooperative breeding, and propensity to learn socially.&nbsp; To accomplish our goals of understanding how learning processes and information flow are related to age, we documented age-related changes in social behavior and foraging skill acquisition, as well as changes in personality traits relevant to learning new things. By documenting all (new) behaviors produced and the contexts in which they appear, we can assess any changes across the lifespan in tendencies to independently invent new behaviors or to learn by watching others perform these behaviors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;We documented gaze following and instances of \"joint attention\" where two monkeys looked at the same object or action: 85% of the time, joint attention was in the context of one monkey closely watching how another foraged; 11% of the time one monkey closely watched how another monkey was touching (usually grooming) another monkey; and sometimes two monkeys jointly observed a predator or some unusual environmental feature. We paid special attention to the role of alloparents (caretakers other than the parents), as sources of information for younger monkeys, documenting the effort that both young monkeys and their caretakers devote to developing these relationships and to guiding one another's attention. Younger monkeys were more prone to watch others' behavior, particularly when they were foraging or grooming, and were particularly attentive to older monkeys. There was no evidence that older monkeys attempted to teach foraging skills to younger monkeys; rather, the younger monkeys seemed to actively seek information, particularly from older monkeys who were generally tolerant of somewhat obtrusive observers.&nbsp; Occasionally a monkey actively solicited the attention of another monkey, but this happened primarily in the context of soliciting coalitionary aid against other monkeys or members of other species.</p>\n<p><em>Methods and data set:</em></p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em> The data set used for documenting new behaviors included over 2100 hours of 10-minute focal animal follows distributed across 87 infants (&lt; 2 yrs old), and 30 grandparents or other monkeys &gt;20 years old;&nbsp; in these follows, we continuously recorded the foraging, object manipulation, gaze direction and social behaviors of our focal monkey and those the focal watched. Because we also wanted information on new behavioral inventions from the broader population, we recorded, on <em>an</em> <em>adlibitum</em> basis, new behaviors from non-focal individuals as well.&nbsp; Special foraging protocols were in place to document, for all individuals, the precise motor details of how foods were processed and who was looking at whom, for the three most difficult-to-process, yet common, foods in the diet: <em>Luehea</em> (N=2542 observations), <em>Sterculia</em> (N=413) and <em>Sloanea</em> (N=2729). Over 88,300 group scans (in which we recorded activities and proximity to all other group members) were used to understand who spent the most time with whom during particular activities. Personality questionnaires were conducted at the end of each intern's year of service, in which interns rated each monkey with regard to personality traits likely to influence asocial or social learning abilities. The information on proximity to others, personality, and the quality of relationships between different monkeys will be used to understand how these traits influence the social transmission of new behaviors through social networks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts:</strong> Twenty-two young scientists (16 women, 6 men) from 5 countries had the opportunity to learn fieldwork and data management skills by participating in data collection for this project; most stayed for a year. Eight of these applied to Masters or PhD programs in relevant fields following their internships and were accepted. About half of these people had the opportunity to assist in developing and/or implementing educational materials for outreach activities in the communities surrounding the forest where we study the monkeys. These took the form of blogs about monkey research, a children's book, an iNaturalist data collection project, construction of a nature trail for documenting climate change and teaching plant identification, and creation of a set of learning modules for teaching basic statistics to high school students using the measurement of monkey photos. We presented talks and nature walks to K-12 students in Costa Rica and organized riverbank cleanups following floods in collaboration with community members. The data collected will be useful for many young scientists, including 3 PhD students (at UCLA, Yale and Univ. of Konstanz), and are expected to contribute to future long-term collaborations in the field of cultural evolution, particularly at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/18/2024<br>\nModified by: Susan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Perry</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1919649/1919649_10627703_1708270815861_MAR_rt_NIM_center_ciQHH_stick_2023_02_14_sep_SMALL_DSC_0018--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1919649/1919649_10627703_1708270815861_MAR_rt_NIM_center_ciQHH_stick_2023_02_14_sep_SMALL_DSC_0018--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Immatures_watch_foraging\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1919649/1919649_10627703_1708270815861_MAR_rt_NIM_center_ciQHH_stick_2023_02_14_sep_SMALL_DSC_0018--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Immatures_watch_foraging\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The alpha female is closely observed by her daughter and niece as she forages for insects in a large stick.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Susan Perry</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Perry\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Immatures_watch_foraging</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1919649/1919649_10627703_1708028732500_FBBgrHEE_2023_07_15sep_P1000721--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1919649/1919649_10627703_1708028732500_FBBgrHEE_2023_07_15sep_P1000721--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Daughter grooms father\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1919649/1919649_10627703_1708028732500_FBBgrHEE_2023_07_15sep_P1000721--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Daughter grooms father\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An elderly male (age 31 yrs) is groomed by his adolescent daughter.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Susan Perry</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Susan&nbsp;E&nbsp;Perry\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Daughter grooms father</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
