 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human societies have lived in conflict with rats for thousands of years. Brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) can carry several diseases shared with humans, known as rat-associated zoonoses, such as leptospirosis, Seoul hantavirus, and bubonic plague. Rats also cause billions of dollars in property damage annually. In addition to physical health risks, chronic exposure to rats and their associated property damage can act as a mental health stressor for residents. A better understanding of what processes increase the risk of disease and mental health impacts from living with rats will help improve public health in cities around the world. While little is known about urban rats, the risks associated with rat infestations are often disproportionately high for low-income communities, likely due to fewer resources to maintain infrastructure and control rodent populations. Income disparities between neighborhoods is especially pervasive in Chicago, Illinois, the city with the most rat complaints per capita in the United States. This combination of high rat encounter rates and income disparities in Chicago likely creates further inequities in resident exposure to rats and disease risk. Frequent negative experiences with rats may also influence resident attitudes toward other species of urban wildlife. For example, strong negative attitudes about rats may be associated with negative attitudes about similar native species such as squirrels. Understanding the relationships between human attitudes about rats and other wildlife will help to mitigate any eroding effects of wildlife pests on public support for urban nature conservation.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this award is to understand how to mitigate public health risks from rats and advance urban conservation by studying the interactions between urban residents and brown rats (Rattus norvegicus). The specific project goals are to: 1) quantify the impacts of rat infestations on the physical and mental health, attitudes, and approaches to pest control of socioeconomically diverse urban residents; and 2) quantify the impacts of pest control initiatives on rat population dynamics, rat disease ecology, and urban predator health. To achieve these objectives, the research will integrate data on rats, predators (i.e. cats), and residents in Chicago neighborhoods that vary in household income. Interviews and surveys will be used to collect data on resident experiences with rats, mental and physical health, and attitudes about rats and other urban wildlife species. In the same blocks, citizen scientists will trap rats and collect fecal samples from free-living cats. This data will be used to relate local rat abundance and rates of infection with corresponding resident experiences and attitudes about rats. Local rates of rat infection will be evaluated with respect to resident experiences with zoonotic pathways such as being exposed to rat feces or urine. Predictive models will be developed to identify the socio-ecological contexts in which risk from rats is highest. To simultaneously quantify the impacts of rodent control activities on wildlife population health, the research will test whether rodent control through chemical rodenticides is associated with changes in the genetic diversity of rats and higher infection risk for Escherichia coli in both rats and free-living cats. The proposed project will be the first to quantify the feedbacks between humans and rodent pests and will advance ecological and public health knowledge applicable to cities around the world. Further, the project will provide societal benefits by improving public health, social justice, and support for urban nature conservation while providing special education and training opportunities in field research for urban and minority students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In terms of the impacts of rats on human health, we found that residents who saw rats daily in their home were more likely to have depressive symptoms after accounting for demographics and neighborhood conditions. These negative effects on mental health were particularly pronounced for people of minority race or ethnicity, men, and lower-income residents. We also found that 10% of rats in Chicago carried the bacteria that causes leptospirosis, a rat-associated disease transmitted through rat urine that can be fatal to humans and dogs if left untreated. We examined four ways in which Chicago residents may be more vulnerable to leptospirosis. These included 1) they are not aware that rats can carry leptospirosis, 2) they are exposed to rat urine in the home, and 3) they live on a block with at least one rat carrying leptospirosis. In terms of awareness, we found that only 28% of 685 survey respondents knew that rats can carry leptospirosis, suggesting that more public education is needed about rat-associated diseases. In terms of exposure to rat urine in the home, we found that residents of minority race or ethnicity, individuals with lower incomes, and particularly residents in the West Side of Chicago were more likely to report rat urine in the home. These results suggest that more support for rat abatement is needed in underserved communities. Conversely, rats were more likely to carry the bacteria that causes leptospirosis in higher-income neighborhoods in areas with more accessible garbage. When we surveyed residents living on blocks with rats carrying leptospirosis, they mentioned interactions that may promote leptospirosis transmission between rats, dogs, and people. These interactions included rats urinating in cars, dogs fighting with rats, dogs drinking out of puddles, children playing in rat-infested yards, flooding in yards, rats burrowing in gardens, and negligent landlords. In terms of the impacts of rat management on rat populations and urban predators, we found that rats that had been exposed to anticoagulant rodenticides (i.e. rat poisons) were significantly more likely to be infected with the bacteria that causes leptospirosis, potentially because these pesticides cause immune dysfunction in other species. We also sampled 93 mesopredators (raccoons, skunks, and Virginia opossums) euthanized by pest professionals and found that 100% had been exposed to anticoagulant rodenticides, suggesting widespread exposure of non-target urban mammals to rat poison. We observed visual evidence that opossums directly consumed poison bait (i.e. teal stomach contents). We also found that three of four baby opossums that had not yet weaned tested positive for the same rodenticide as their mother, suggesting transfer through milk. We also found that mesopredators were more likely to be exposed to rodenticides and were exposed to more types compared to rats. We also found that 7% of 57 feral cats had been exposed to anticoagulant rodenticides, suggesting that rodenticide exposure could be a welfare concern for outdoor cats placed to manage rats, but this low prevalence calls into question how often these cats were consuming rats. Taken together, our results suggest that rats can be considered another environmental health burden for the mental and physical health of marginalized urban communities. Specifically, individuals experiencing severe rat infestations may benefit from mental health support in addition to rat abatement. Our results also highlight that relying on rat poison to manage rats may inadvertently exacerbate public health risks by potentially making rats more susceptible to leptospirosis. Further, the widespread exposure to rodenticides we observed in urban mesopredators suggests that relying on rodenticides to manage rats creates health risks for urban wildlife. When asked for their suggestions to improve rat management, study participants mentioned proactive approaches with routine alley inspections as well as waste management in rat-proof containers, reducing food waste, and more frequent garbage pick-up. Participants also mentioned improved communication about the shared responsibilities of governments, businesses, homeowners, and renters as well as a more collaborative approach within and among communities.&nbsp; In light of our results, we recommend that more resources for rat abatement and education be allocated to high risk, underserved, and predominantly minority communities because they are disproportionately impacted by rats. A more equitable, collaborative, and interdisciplinary approach to rat management can help address the diverse ways that rats affect human well-being and prevent inadvertent negative effects of rat management to protect human and animal health in cities around the world.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/04/2024<br>\nModified by: Maureen&nbsp;H&nbsp;Murray</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923882/1923882_10624784_1712234237576_ChicagoLepto_V2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923882/1923882_10624784_1712234237576_ChicagoLepto_V2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Urban leptospirosis as a One Health system\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1923882/1923882_10624784_1712234237576_ChicagoLepto_V2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Urban leptospirosis as a One Health system\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A One Health approach recognizes how the health of humans, animals, and the environment are all connected.
