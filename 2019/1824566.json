 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teaching methods that actively engage students are more effective for learning about science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) than traditional teaching methods such as lecturing. One specific active learning method that has been broadly implemented in STEM fields at both the high school and college levels is Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). Professional development experiences that enable STEM teachers to interact with others who use similar active learning methods help them become even more effective in their classrooms. One objective of the POGIL Project's strategic plan is to increase the diversity of the POGIL faculty community and the students it serves. This includes supporting the participation of faculty members of diverse backgrounds and from a full range of high schools, colleges, and universities across the United States. The second National Conference for Advanced POGIL Practitioners will bring teachers who use POGIL together to network, discuss common concerns, and share accomplishments.\r\n\r\nThis NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE: EHR) project will provide support for about 30 faculty members and a plenary speaker from targeted groups to attend the second National Conference for Advanced POGIL Practitioners (NCAPP). The targeted college and university faculty members to be supported are from groups underrepresented in STEM fields, two-year colleges, minority-serving institutions, or other institutions with limited financial resources for faculty professional development. The award also provides support for facilitating a conference workshop on \"Inclusive Excellence in the POGIL Classroom\", which is expected to promote increased awareness and understanding of diversity and equity issues in the classroom, as well as the use of thoughtful and inclusive classroom practices by conference attendees. Overall, the second NCAPP will provide a forum for faculty members to share expertise and accomplishments; work with others to design new POGIL activities and strategies for implementation; and discuss challenges related to using POGIL in their STEM classrooms. The impact of the conference on participants' teaching practices, as well as opportunities for new professional interactions and contacts, will be evaluated via surveys and interviews.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
