 "awd_abstract_narration": "The colonization of land by animals is one of the greatest evolutionary events in the history of life, but our understanding of the physics of this occurrence is limited.  Long before animals walked on land, the first steps were taken beneath the water's surface by animals walking on submerged substrates.  This behavior formed the basis for eventual movement on land, but the physics display a complex mix of fluid forces (drag, buoyancy) and typical walking forces (foot-substrate interactions, gravity).  Understanding of this behavior is limited by the inability to effectively measure the forces exerted on the substrate. This project will create a custom-designed force sensing system to record the small substrate forces that occur during underwater walking, and, combined with measurements of drag, buoyancy, and other fluid forces, will provide the first complete picture of the mechanics of this behavior.  This will provide crucial insights into the evolution of walking and how animals adapted to the eventual transition onto land.  In addition to providing valuable training for graduate students, this project will provide the scientific community with a new tool for investigating underwater forces and provide insights for the design of biologically-inspired underwater exploration vehicles.\r\n\r\nEffective locomotion was crucial to the initial invasion of land, and underwater walking was the key behavioral predecessor that was exapted into terrestrial use during this transition.  However, the biomechanics and control of underwater walking are poorly known, in part due to the difficulty of measuring small substrate reaction forces.  The combination of both fluid and substrate forces could make typical walking dynamics untenable, particularly the reduced effective body weight due to buoyant support, and damping effects from the surrounding fluid (particularly drag and the added mass effect). This project will investigate the dynamics and control of underwater walking via direct measurement of substrate reaction forces using a novel underwater force sensing system, combined with measurements of fluid forces, across variable substrates and environmental conditions. This will provide insights into how these forces interact and how animals control these interactions to produce controlled locomotion, as well as how changes in environment could affect these dynamics and how underwater walking could be exapted to a terrestrial setting.  Effective understanding of these dynamics could provide insight into the use of underwater walking in extant species, the biomechanics of the ancient transitions from underwater to terrestrial walking, and insight into the control of underwater walking robotic systems for exploration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This behavior arose early in evolution, served as the precursor for terrestrial walking, and remains widespread among modern species. However, the difficulty of measuring the small forces applied to the substrate has limited our understanding of this important behavior. To solve this, we created a low-cost waterproof force plate, made using 3D printed materials and commercial electronics, which could detect the tiny forces exerted by animals walking underwater.\n\n\nUsing this system, we characterized the underwater walking of axolotls, a salamander which retains its aquatic juvenile form throughout its life and frequently uses underwater walking. Vertical forces were low due to buoyancy of the body, but the need to move against drag resulted in strong propulsive forces. Furthermore, the inverted pendulm exchange between kinetic and potential energy, an energy-saving feature typical of terrestrial walking, does not occur due buoyant support almost completely counteracting gravity and thus greatly reducing potential energy fluctuations. Finally, the combination of buoyancy and drag effectively insulated the axolotl from any consequence of falling or tripping, allowing a highly variable gait.\n\n\nCollaboration with Friday Harbor Marine Laboratories allowed us to repeat these tests on California spot prawns. These denser crustaceans were less supported by buoyancy, but showed broadly similar results. Although potential energy fluctuations were similar to those of kinetic energy in prawns, minimal energy exchange occurred due to poor alignment between the two. We were also able to record several trials in which the prawns propelled themselves with both foot contact with the substrate and swimming thrust from the pleopods simultaneously. Additional trials with skates were able to detect the forces exerted by the fishs wake, including pulses of thrust from the flapping pectoral fins, as it swam above the force plate without contacting it\n\n\nThese results have significant impacts in our understanding of both modern underwater walking animals and the transition from water to land in ancient species. Understanding the differences in forces and energetics between terrestrial and underwater walking can help us understand how animals which primarily walked underwater adapted to the new demands of the terrestrial world. Furthermore, these insights can also help us design better underwater walking robots, using bio-inspired design to leverage the unique benefits of this mode of locomotion.
