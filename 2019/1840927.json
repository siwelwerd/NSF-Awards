 "awd_abstract_narration": "Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are an ecologically important component of the Southern Ocean's food web, yet little is known about their behavior in response to many features of their aquatic environment. This project will improve understanding of krill swimming and schooling behavior by examining individual responses to light levels, water flow rates, the presence of attractive and repulsive chemical cues. Flow, light and chemical conditions will be controlled and altered in specialized tanks outfitted with high speed digital camera systems so that individual krill responses to these factors can be measured in relevant schooling settings. This analysis will be used to predict preferred environments, define the capacity of krill to detect and move to them (and away from unfavorable ones). Such information will then be used to improve models that estimate the energetic costs of behaviors associated with different types of environments. Linking individual behavior to those of larger krill aggregations will also improve acoustic assessments of krill densities. Understanding the capacity of krill to respond to environmental perturbations will improve our understanding of the ecology of high latitude ecosystems and provide relevant information for the management of krill fisheries. The project will support graduate and undergraduate students and provide training for as post-doctoral associate. Curricular materials and public engagement activities will be based on the project's aims and activities. Project investigators will share model results and predictions of krill movements and school structure with experts interested in krill conservation and management. \r\n\r\nThe project will use horizontal and vertical laminar flow tunnels to examine krill behavior under naturally relevant conditions. Horizontal (1-10 cm per second) and vertical (1-3 mm per second) flow velocities mimic naturally relevant current patterns, while light levels and spectral quality will be varied from complete darkness to intensities experienced across the depth range inhabited by krill. Attractive phytoplankton odor will be created by dosing the flumes to obtain background chlorophyll a levels approximating average and bloom conditions, while repulsive cues will be generated from penguin guano. Behavior of individual krill in all conditions will be video recorded with cameras visualizing X-Y and Y-Z planes, and 3D movements will be reconstructed by video motion analysis at a 5 Hz sampling rate. The distribution of horizontal and vertical swimming angles and velocities will be used to create an individual based model (IBM) of krill movement in response to each condition, where krill behavior at each model time step is based on random draws from the velocity and angular distributions. Since krill commonly travel in groups, further experiments will examine the behavior of small krill schools in these same conditions to further parameterize variables such as individual spacing. Researchers will examine krill aggregation structure from 3D video records of krill swimming in a specially designed kriesel tank, and compute nearest neighbor distances (NND) and correlations of swimming angles among individuals within the aggregation. Krill movements in the IBM will be constrained to adhere to observed NND and angular correlations. Large scale oceanographic models will be used to define spatial environments in which the modelled krill will be allowed to move using simulated schools of 1000-100,000 krill. Model output will include the school swimming speed, direction and structure (packing density, NND). Researchers will compare available acoustic data sets of krill schools in measured flow and phytoplankton abundance to evaluate the model predictions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The reconstructed 3d paths (Figure 3) are used to determine swimming speed, turning, body orientation and other variables.&nbsp; Krill actively orient to horizontal flows to move upstream in speeds as low as 3 mm s<sup>-1</sup>. Food odor has complex effects, increasing swimming speed and orientation to flow at low levels, indicating krill actively seek out plankton blooms. &nbsp;High concentrations of food odor reduce orientation to flow and increase turning, which presumably functions to keep krill in areas of high food concentration and increases feeding.&nbsp; Thus, krill movements are shaped by environmental conditions, particularly flow and food. Krill responses to food are reduced in the presence of predator odor (penguin guano), which also decreases feeding rate. Thus, penguins have both direct and indirect effects that can propagate to other species. Krill respond more to flow in the absence of light, suggesting visual cues provide additional, but not, critical orientation cues. Krill don&rsquo;t respond as strongly to vertical flows, but food odor has the same effects.</p>\n<p>We built a specially designed circular flow chamber to examine krill swimming in groups (Figure 4). Krill form coherent aggregations only under certain conditions. Schooling is contingent upon both flow and light, and flow results in more organization when light was low/absent. &nbsp;&nbsp;Organization peaks at a density of 9 krill L<sup>-1</sup>. Lower densities might not provide sufficient cues, whereas higher densities might interfere with the ability of neighbors to see and respond to each other. &nbsp;When challenged with similar conditions, krill swim more quickly in groups than individuals, which supports a long standing supposition that schooling increases swimming efficiency and reduces energetic cost by reducing drag (in much the same way as cycling in a pack).</p>\n<p>Using the data on krill swimming in different conditions, we were able to identify chlorophyll and flow speed as the most important variables that determine krill behavior. Our current simulations have shown that krill form loosely structured, poorly packed balls in low flow but that in higher flows of water krill form tightly packed, elongated oval shapes that point in the direction of flow (Figure 5). Individual behaviors therefore scale up in a way that we can predict swarm structure, which helps interpret data on krill swarms collected by ships. Including chemical conditions such as food is the next step and will help us further understand how krill respond to environmental conditions and how this affects where krill are found and their swarm structure. Eventually we will model the behavior of krill in real oceanographic data to see where krill swarm (Figure 6), how long they stay in different locations and how these swarms form and disperse in realistic environmental conditions. Initial tests into this space have been conducted with preliminary results in ROMSPath showing that our work will greatly improve already existing models on krill movement in Antarctica.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 08/28/2024<br>\nModified by: Marc&nbsp;J&nbsp;Weissburg</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1840927/1840927_10624297_1724873737855_f2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1840927/1840927_10624297_1724873737855_f2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1840927/1840927_10624297_1724873737855_f2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2.
