 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heightened awareness of the importance of maintaining ecologically diverse natural areas has increased urgency for scientists to identify and explain the biological dimensions and services of the environment that are vital for supporting human populations and sustaining prosperity. Biological diversity, or the distribution, function, and interdependency of species, is a vital dimension of natural systems upon which the sustainability of human systems depends. The biological diversity of Earth's natural habitats has been inventoried for over 300 years by intrepid biological explorers. The species information produced by those surveys, derived directly from biological specimens, tissues, and DNA samples, is now being rapidly amassed in internet information systems. The data represent a monumental and unparalleled source of information about the origin, distribution, and diversity of life on Earth. With over a billion species occurrence database records online, internet-accessible information on the evolutionary relationships of millions of species in the online Tree of Life database, online global climate data, and supercomputing capabilities, biodiversity researchers are enabled for the first time, to analyze questions about the ecological and evolutionary factors that shape patterns and properties of biodiversity on the scale of continents and the entire globe. That knowledge will produce insight for public understanding and policy vital to the conservation and sustainability of diverse natural and human systems. In addition to facilitating research, the BiotaPhy Project is committed to the development of a scientifically literate public and plans educational, training, and outreach activities to address multiple constituencies. It will provide collaborative post-doc, graduate, undergraduate, and high school training in data-intensive biodiversity science while building on a strong record of recruiting members of underrepresented groups.\r\n \r\nThis project will undertake software engineering, open-access, deployment and training for the BiotaPhy computational workflow environment on the web. The Platform will be supported as a biodiversity community gateway for data-intensive science. The software will enable integrative and powerful analyses, and quantitative models of the geographical patterns of Earth's species diversity past, present, and future. BiotaPhy software will enable scientists to address novel questions relating phenotypic and ecological biodiversity, community assembly, and species diversification across time and space. The computational workflows will have broad environmental research relevance and the potential for transformative impact on data-intensive research spanning ecology, phylogenetics, systematics, and conservation biology. The BiotaPhy workflow platform will provide those capabilities by assembling input datasets, computing single species distribution models and multispecies macroecological datasets, and then output statistical tests of evolutionary and ecological hypotheses to a graphical web interface for review and knowledge discovery. The BiotaPhy Platform?s production deployment will: (1) increase research into and creation of new synthetic approaches at the interface of phylogenetics, ecology, evolutionary biology, and biogeography; (2) increase the accessibility and utilization of Open Tree of Life, iDigBio, and Lifemapper resources; (3) incorporate community input and training; and (4) build and support cross-domain data integration services as sustainable biodiversity community infrastructure. The BiotaPhy Project can be accessed at http://biotaphy.github.io.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This award supported a collaboration among computer scientists, biological diversity researchers, and students to develop software that would analyze very large data sets of ecological and geographical information about the Earth's wild species derived from preserved specimens of plants and animals archived in natural history museums. The central product of the research is a software platform called \"BiotaPhy\". BiotaPhy takes a massive amount of information on the current global distribution of hundreds of thousands of species and merges it with data on the evolutionary history of the species (phylogenetic tree data), and also also inputs climate data to produce analysis products on how evolutionary relatedness of species and climate, have determined the global spatial patterns of biological diversity. Understanding the causes of the patterns of species diversity in natural communities, how it was created, and how it is naturally maintained, is an ongoing grand challenge for the science of biogeography. BiotaPhy's integration of these different kinds of evolutionary and environmental data produces analyses and insight into how evolution and ecological forces have contributed to the continental and global scale patterns of biological diversity.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Prior to the development of the BiotaPhy software platform, it was not possible to computationally synthesize the relationships between biogeography, climate, and evolutionary history of species for data sets containing distribution information on tens of thousands of species at a time. The primary technical challenges were to design a software architecture and a computational workflow that could ingest, process, and analyze massive amounts of species data in minutes, and to develop new methods to efficiently store and represent hundreds of millions of species occurrence data points. These two accomplishments allowed us to quantitatively analyze how evolution and ecological forces have influenced existing geographical patterns of biological diversity.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-1caad4b6-7fff-0c50-6101-a8020376495a\" style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Figure 1 illustrates the functions and data flows of the BiotaPhy software analysis workflows. </span><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-498cd7a3-7fff-bb8a-a139-089e6d092db6\" style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Our research examined several different groups of organisms and several data integration workflows.

In addition to the phylogeographic research questions for plant and animal groups addressed by BiotaPhy software, we designed the platform for extensibility for broader application and integration beyond the specialized research objectives of our biologist partners. In collaboration with the US Geological Survey (USGS), we applied the Biotaphy platform's analytical capabilities to their data product the \"United States Register of Invasive and Introduced Species\", which documents the spread of invasive and introduced species in the U.S. In that activity we computed several biodiversity indices or metrics for extent and diversity of those invasive and introduced species in U.S. states, counties, and territorial lands. Another broader application of the technology we developed was to integrate BiotaPhy's computational and analytical capabilities with collections management software used by university and municipal natural history museums across the US. BiotaPhy's computational workflows will allow individual museums to quantitatively assess the information and scientific value of their collections holdings (specimens) relative to what is known about species from specimens curated in other museums around the world. This applied biological collections management use of BiotaPhy will take advantage of the platform's high-throughput workflows and ability to integrate related scientific data resources through the internet.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">For over 350 years, intrepid field biologists have explored Earth's wild places to discover and inventory the species of the planet.
