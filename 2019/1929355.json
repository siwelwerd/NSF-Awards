 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to sense and respond to mechanical force is critical for the proper function of cells, tissues, and organisms in all kingdoms of life. The emerging field of mechanobiology seeks to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these responses. This project investigates the mechanobiology of plants, which involves the dynamic integration of internal and external mechanical stimuli throughout growth and development. The overarching goal of this research is to develop the Arabidopsis thaliana pollen grain into a useful system for the study of plant mechanobiology. As pollen is particularly susceptible to heat and humidity, understanding how pollen grains respond to water stresses may help improve food security in a changing climate. Podcasting as well as existing structures for elementary school curriculum development at Washington University will be used to recruit, mentor, and retain a diverse global community of motivated plant biologists and to encourage an appreciation for plant biology in the general public.\r\n\r\nThe research will advance our knowledge of cell mechanobiology by investigating three key components of the Arabidopsis pollen grain during the processes of hydration, germination and tube growth: mechanosensitive ion channels, the cell wall, and the plasma membrane. All three aims integrate computational approaches (kinetic model equations, finite element modeling, and computational fluid dynamics) with experimental approaches (molecular genetics, live-imaging, plant physiology, and electrophysiology). Three hypotheses will be tested: 1) Mechanosensitive ion channels serve as osmotic safety valves that tune hydrostatic pressure during pollen hydration, germination and tube growth; 2) Local differences in the structure and composition of the pollen grain cell wall dictate the mechanics of hydration and germination; and 3) The pollen plasma membrane area and the number of active mechanosensitive channels in it change during hydration, and these changes affect pollen grain mechanics.  The work will involve the training of undergraduate and graduate students. \r\n\r\nThis award is supported by the Cellular Dynamics and Function program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
