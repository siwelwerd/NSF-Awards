 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbon nanotubes are lighter, stronger, and conduct more electricity/heat than other engineering materials for the same weight. Carbon nanotubes and composites utilizing them can improve the performance of aircraft/spacecraft, cars, and buildings. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program grant supports research which advances knowledge about manufacturing of these promising nano-engineered materials, promoting the progress of science and advancing the national prosperity. To achieve the highest performance, these carbon nanotubes must be incorporated and ordered within the polymer matrix based on its final macroscopic structure. A novel and scalable magnetic method is used to mix and order the nanotubes within materials. This controlled nanotube structuring is the key to fully harness their potential to  potentially replace much heavier structural  metals, resulting in energy-efficient, low-maintenance, and safer transport vehicles.  This magnetic manufacturing technology could be applied to engineer materials for power and biomedical applications, such as battery electrodes, artificial muscles, etc., that are of national interest.  Educational activities to promote diverse participation in STEM careers and to close the gap between engineering education and real-world demands are integrated into the research plans. \r\n\r\nIntegration of lightweight carbon nanotubes into aerospace or other structural -reinforced plastic composites are investigated for multifunctional property enhancement. Organized carbon nanotube networks are expected to improve interlaminar strength, to replace heavier metal shielding against electromagnetic interference protection, and to function as sensing/actuation layers.  However, composite property improvement with carbon nanotubes is currently limited because (1) multi-scale structure-interphase-property relationships are not well understood, and (2) scalable and tailorable integration of nano-sized carbon nanotubes into macro-sized composites needs to be developed.  This grant addresses these two challenges.  First, tailorable 3D structuring of nanotubes in polymer matrices using low-frequency magnetic fields will be studied to enable control over carbon nanotube spacing and the interphase conditions. Second, the effects of carbon nanotube implementation, such as 3D structures and nanotube-polymer interphases, on multifunctional properties of fiber-reinforced plastic composites will be experimentally evaluated and modeled using analytical and Monte Carlo simulation approaches.  The  knowledge of magnetic assembly and of scaling effects, together with a scalable manufacturing technology, will accelerate design and fabrication of hierarchically structured nanofiller-implemented composites with advanced properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) are lighter, stronger, and conduct more electricity/heat than other engineering materials for the same weight, because of their nano size. However, attempts to improve performance of aircraft/spacecraft, cars, and buildings by mixing nanotubes to their structures have been unsuccessful because of the vast size difference between nanotubes and structures. This award supported the fundamental research to answer critical questions about this challenge: what is preventing nanotubes from fully improving performance, and how can nanotubes be effectively incorporated into large-size structures? In this work, a novel and scalable magnetic method is used not to just mix but also to organize nanotubes within materials at the desired locations, based on the hypothesis that controlled nanotube structuring is the key to fully harness their potential. First, CNTs were coated with a thin layer (~10s of nm) of magnetically-reactive nickel (Ni), and then surface-treated to bond well with the epoxy matrix. These Ni-coated CNTs were integrated into prepreg sheets to form carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs). Through simulation (multi-physics COMSOL simulation) and experiments (short beam strength test), the magnetic field strength was adjusted (~100s of G, on the same order as the fridge magnet) to be just strong enough to align but not to agglomerate magnetized CNTs. Furthermore, this work took advantage of the magnetic responsiveness of the Ni-coated CNTs to characterize their alignment by vibrating sample magnetometer. The load-displacement plots from the short beam shear test were analyzed and confirmed that CNTs, especially aligned CNTs, enhanced the post-fracture energy dissipation. These novel CNT-CFRPs could potentially replace heavy metals, resulting in energy-efficient, low-maintenance, and safer transport vehicles. In addition, the magnetic manufacturing technology could be applied to engineer materials for other power and biomedical applications (battery electrodes, artificial muscles, etc.) that are of national interest.\n\nThis grant also supported educational activities that will promote diverse participation in STEM careers, and to close the gap between engineering education and real-world demands.
