 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many Arab countries are making significant investments in science and technology and have unique facilities and resources. However, there are few mechanisms for U.S. researchers to learn about research efforts in this region. This meeting provides an exceptional opportunity for U.S. scientists to interact with promising young researchers in the Middle East to develop new ideas and approaches to apply to ongoing research and discover opportunities for collaboration. \r\n\r\nThis project will help support the seventh conference of the Arab-American Frontiers program series, to be held in Alexandria, Egypt in fall 2019. The event will provide an opportunity for approximately 40 early-career US scientists to attend a three-day conference of approximately 100 total attendees that seeks to: enhance scientific dialogue and exchange between young US and Arab researchers; encourage the transfer of techniques and approaches across disciplines, strengthen science and engineering collaboration within and beyond the US and the Middle East/North Africa region, and also empower young scientists, engineers and medical professionals to assume leadership roles in their fields and beyond. Participants are selected through a competitive application process, ensuring a meeting of research-active scientists and engineers who are ready to capitalize on the ideas and relationships developed at the conference. The event is co-organized by the Library of Alexandria and the Egyptian Academy of Scientific Research and Technology, and NSF funds leverage their significant support.  \r\n\r\nThe conference purposely focuses on several topics that are not directly related to encourage the participants to make connections beyond their field of study and to facilitate interdisciplinary dialogue that may offer new, unexpected insights. Participants at previous workshops have highlighted this broad interdisciplinarity as an intellectual highlight of the meeting. The focus areas for this meeting were developed by the volunteer organizing committee and represent globally important topics in which the Middle East has valuable expertise and is investing important resources. All five topics represent research challenges that require the insights of multiple disciplines.\r\n- Sensing Technology \r\n- Artificial intelligence \r\n- Water \r\n- Infectious Diseases \r\n- Community Resilience\r\n\r\nFurther development of ideas for cooperative work that develop at the conference will be facilitated by small collaboration grants for which participants may apply after the meeting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The session panels and daily poster sessions generated new ideas for cross disciplinary innovation that do not usually take place in regular single discipline-focused conferences. Speakers were selected based on their strong communication skills and were given clear instructions to prepare presentations that not only focus on the novelty of their research but also set the broader context for their field and how it can bridge out to other disciplines. As stated by a US participant in the 2019 post-meeting survey: ?This is not to be missed if you are at all interested in doing collaborative and interdisciplinary research.

For example, prior to their participation in the program, less than 15 % of US respondents had collaborations with researchers in the MENA region. This number jumped to 63% following their attendance, showing a marked change in engagement with Arab counterparts. Additionally, given the multidisciplinary nature of the event, 72.9% of attendees indicated that their participation in the symposia led to new developments and ideas in their research.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Last, building new collaborations between the United States and the Arab world continues to be of critical importance. While many see the current geopolitical context as a deterrent to work with the Arab world, we believe that it is now more imperative to strengthen relationships with this part of the world through science diplomacy, especially in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/30/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
