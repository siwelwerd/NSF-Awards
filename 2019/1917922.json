 "awd_abstract_narration": "Language deprivation is common among individuals born deaf when they do not have early access to a sign or spoken language, which causes deficits in their ultimate language performance. Understanding the nature of these age of acquisition effects on sentence structure can illuminate the underlying mechanisms of the critical period for language development and provide clinicians and educators with important information about the nature of language deprivation in deaf students.\r\n \r\nThe current proposal examines the effects of early language deprivation on language processing at the basic phrasal level. The participants are deaf adults and adolescents who experienced minimal early language and began to acquire American Sign Language (ASL) as their first language (L1) later in life. Study 1 investigates longitudinal development of basic word order in four case studies. Study 2 investigates whether late L1 learners rely on syntactic cues or use alternative strategies when comprehending and producing simple mono-clausal sentences using a sentence-picture verification task and an elicited word order production task. The participants are a group of deaf late L1 learners (n = 10, Age of Acquisition, AoA > 8) and a control group of deaf native signers (n = 10). Study 3 investigates these phenomena with adolescents who are deaf native signers (n = 10) and late L1 learners with early AoA (n = 10, AoA 4-6), as well as adolescents who are late L1 learners (AoA 8-10). This manipulation of AoA investigates the questions of 1) whether childhood vs adolescent L1 AoA has different effects on sentence processing strategies and 2) when late L1 learners reach a stable stage of processing basic phrasal structure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A better understanding of how impoverished early language affects later language development is crucial to ensure successful language development in this population, which then supports other aspects of individual development. Previous research found that morpho-syntactically complex structures are more vulnerable to impoverished early language, but the reasons why this linguistic domain is especially vulnerable still require further investigation. In particular, it is less clear how simple structures such as word order, which are the foundations for more complex syntactic structures, may be affected by lacking early language input. Using a series of psycholinguistic experiments that elicit production and comprehension of simple transitive events that are either plausible (e.g. a boy biting a banana) or implausible (e.g. an banana biting a boy), the current project explicitly examined the robustness of basic SVO word order use in American Sign Language (ASL) by deaf individuals with severely delayed first exposure to ASL. We found that when deaf individuals with no prior accessible language began acquiring ASL after 9 years of age, even after an extended period of daily use of the language (at least 9 years, and in some cases decades), they still tend to rely on world knowledge instead of word order when comprehending implausible SVO sentences. A follow-up study found that deaf individuals with delayed ASL onset are still capable of using basic SVO order to comprehend implausible transitive events (e.g. a pencil biting a table), but they tend to perform worse when there are conflicting semantic cues such as animacy in the sentence (e.g. a pencil biting a rabbit). We also found a production-comprehension asymmetry, where many of the deaf participants were able to use the SVO order consistently during elicited production, but not when they were comprehending sentences with conflicting semantic cues. Our findings suggest that although the basic word order structure appear to be fully acquired by deaf individuals even when they were exposed to the language later in life, they may still face processing difficulties at the very basic level. Their processing difficulties in resolving conflicting cues may then affect further learning, as basic word order is often considered as the stepping stone for more complex sentence structures.
