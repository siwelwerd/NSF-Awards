 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arthropod parasites (specifically, insects and their relatives) are responsible for economically critical issues in human health, wildlife conservation, and livestock productivity.  Because natural history collections are permanent repositories for past and present parasite specimens, these collections and their data can help address these significant societal challenges in human and animal health and safety.  Natural history collections often contain specimens and ancillary materials that are completely unknown to the broader community, yet represent irreplaceable knowledge about organismal habitats, distributions, and parasite-host associations.  Further, these collections yield information that can be used to model ecological processes and changes in species distributions, predict the future spread of human and animal disease, update taxonomy, and help identify under-represented parasite groups in urgent need of sampling and threatened parasite diversity in need of conservation.  This project will provide digital records (i.e., specimen label data and images) of invaluable arthropod parasite collections to make research-ready baseline data accessible online, catalyzing new research and education initiatives.  These newly digitized data will have immediate and long-lasting benefits for our understanding of organismal associations, biodiversity, and beyond.  \r\n\r\nThe Terrestrial Parasite Tracker Thematic Collection Network (TPT-TCN) will digitize over one million arthropod specimens representing species that are significant parasites and disease vectors of vertebrates in the United States.  This digitization effort will integrate millions of vertebrate host records with vector and disease monitoring data shared by state and federal agency collaborators, creating a novel foundation for integrative, long-term research.  This project is a collaboration of taxonomists and curators from vertebrate and invertebrate collections, as well as epidemiologists, ecologists, data-scientists, and biodiversity informatics specialists.  This reach is further extended by the 26 collaborating research collections and other initiatives.  This project will empower ongoing citizen science and public awareness campaigns with the tools to understand distribution changes of arthropod vectors and associated diseases due to environmental change and global movement.  Public education initiatives include partnering with natural history museums to educate the public about parasites via science-focused lectures, exhibits, summer youth programs, informal presentations, and developing new online educational resources for teachers in underserved communities.  All specimen images generated by this project will be used for the development of a rapid identification tool for parasites which will be made accessible through the internet and smartphone apps and shared with iDigBio (idigbio.org).  The TPT-TCN will also develop and implement undergraduate teaching modules focused on data held in natural history collections.  These modules will be disseminated to academic institutions across the United States and made available online.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Natural history collections are the primary and permanent repositories for past, present, and future terrestrial arthropod parasite specimens and data associated with these specimens can address significant societal challenges such as human and animal health and safety. Unfortunately, arthropod parasites represent a massive gap in the context of current digitization efforts in natural history collections. As part of the multi-institutional Terrestrial Parasite Tracker (TPT) collaboration, our goal was to document all the data from each specimen and make these invaluable data available online through a specimen databases. This digitization results in making research-ready baseline data accessible, catalyzing new research and education initiatives. At Texas A&amp;M University, we were able to digitize over 57,000 terrestrial parasite arthropod specimens, including specimens that are fluid-preserved, on insect pins, and mounted on slides. Data digitized came from a variety of parasites, including fleas, ticks, mites, lice, and flies. Processing all these different preservation types led us to establish clear and efficient step-by-step instructions that we have shared with other collections as well as online through GitHub. Working with all these different parasites also led us to realize the importance of having a standardized naming system for all natural history collections and data repositories and aggregators. We have worked hard to make these naming systems broadly available, including publishing our work in a peer-reviewed publication. We have taken over 500 close-up, magnified images of flies to share for identification purposes, and we have processed specimens that are taken as ectoparasites (i.e., parasites found on the body of the host) from their vertebrate hosts. These specimens are often consolidated together as ectoparasites in individual vials and the contents of these vials are rarely examined or deposited into natural history collections in an informative way. We were able to process over 1,500 ectoparasite vials, which included sorting by ectoparasite type, depositing the specimens into a natural history collection, and uniting host and parasite data across different natural history collections. These host-parasite associations also were shared in a repository for organismal interactions, allowing the scientific and public communities to easily discover these types of interactions, which often involve distantly related organisms. Our newly digitized and freely available data will have immediate and long-lasting benefits for our understanding of organismal associations, biodiversity, and beyond.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/08/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jessica&nbsp;E&nbsp;Light</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1901916/1901916_10628103_1694183724214_Silvius_jeanae_dorsal--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1901916/1901916_10628103_1694183724214_Silvius_jeanae_dorsal--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Silvius_jeanae_dorsal\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1901916/1901916_10628103_1694183724214_Silvius_jeanae_dorsal--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Silvius_jeanae_dorsal\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dorsal view of the fly, Silvius jeanae.
