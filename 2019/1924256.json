 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conversion of solar energy into electricity and fuels has the potential to revolutionize environmentally-friendly and sustainable energy production. The widespread adoption of solar panels is partially limited by the relatively low efficiencies and relatively high costs of the underlying solar-harvesting materials. The design and discovery of new efficient and inexpensive solar energy conversion materials can be accelerated by computational modeling of excited states dynamics in these systems. Studies of excited states dynamics can reveal unwanted energy loss and charge transfer in these systems, and suggest ways to control them. These modeling strategies require scientists to master advanced theories, specialized software and cyberinfrastructure for modeling excited states. Nonetheless, training in this area remains relatively scarce; the community is often unaware of the available cyberinfrastructure, lacks the best practice guidelines, and may experience entry barriers to employing these advanced tools. This pilot project fills the above gaps by providing targeted training to young scientists in the proficient use of advanced cyberinfrastructure for modeling excited states dynamics in solar energy materials, raising new workforce capable to pursue work that expressly promotes energy security. In this way, the project directly serves the national interests, as stated by NSF's mission: to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; or to secure the national defense.\r\n\r\nThe project leverages and combines existing cyberinfrastructure to produce a versatile platform for advanced training: the general-purpose Libra code library, for modeling excited states dynamics; and the Virtual Infrastructure for Data Intensive Analysis (VIDIA) platform, for web-based data analysis and visualization. The resulting cyberinfrastructure tightly integrates these two components into a gateway to host training in modeling excited states dynamics of solar energy materials. Using this gateway, intensive training for 50 graduate students from across the United States is provided in two two-week summer school sessions. Building on the capabilities and resources of Libra/VIDIA, the summer school covers the fundamentals of nonadiabatic and quantum dynamics theories; best practices for scientific code development; and practical hands-on sessions that focus on a variety of existing tools for excited states dynamics. Experts in the fields of nonadiabatic dynamics and solar energy materials modeling provide instruction on special topics. The Libra/VIDIA software ecosystem also serves as a scientific gateway that enables online education, interactive classroom teaching, and the broader participation of the community in a variety of educational and research projects covering the theory of quantum dynamics and material science. Both the software platform and the training sessions provided by this project facilitate the adoption of advanced methods and tools for modeling nonadiabatic and excited states dynamics developed by the scientific community.  The Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Office of Cyberinfrastructure in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate contribute funds to this award.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It aimed to facilitate the adoption of available open-source software solutions for such kinds of modeling. An emphasis has been put on modeling nonadiabatic dynamics, especially in extended systems that represent materials. The project also aimed to promote the adoption and the broader use of the Libra package for quantum nonadiabatic dynamics simultion in the materials by the corresponding computational chemistry community. These goals have been accomplished by: a) creating the Computational Chemistry CyberTraining GitHub organization (<a href=\"https://github.com/compchem-cybertraining\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/compchem-cybertraining</a>) and developing comprehensive and detailed tutorials covering the usage of multiple packages; b) conducting three CyberTraining summer schools/workshops.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project provided instructional experience and led to the creation of extensive educational materials in the form of tutorials, presentations, and videorecordings of lectures and hands-on exercises. We have covered multiple packages specializing in modeling quantum and nonadiabatic dynamics of excited electronic states: Libra, Quantics, Newton-X, SHARC, SHARC/COBRAMM, NEXMD, DynEMol, Hefei-NAMD, CT-MQC, pyUNIxMD, Redfield, TT-SOFT/TT-Chebyshev, QXMD; packages for electronic structure calculations: DFTB+, CP2K, QE, eQE, NWChem, GAMESS, OpenMolcas, BGW/paratec, COLUMBUS; and packages for automation of calculations, force field generation and creating nanoparticles: nano-qmflows, CAT, auto-FOX. The project led to the development of an ecosystem of these codes, installed and configured at the Center for Computational Research at the University at Buffalo (UB). These packages have been used by the workshop participants, and are adopted by several research groups at UB and PI's external collaborators. Several Conda environments and Jupyter kernels have been built to enable easy interactive access to various kinds of computations as well as to simplify and streamline the data analysis, especially for non-expert users. Such resources have been actively adopted by the PI&rsquo;s research group, as well as by the PI in several courses taught at UB (such as the graduate courses CHE 458/506 &ldquo;Physical Chemistry 2: Quantum Chemistry and Spectroscopy of Molecules and Nanostructures&rdquo; and CHE 512 &ldquo;Physical Topics: Programming for Chemists&rdquo;). The materials created during this project, especially the tutorials on electronic structure calculation codes will be used by the PI in his computational chemistry laboratory class in the coming semesters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project helped support three summer schools/workshops (one fully virtual, one hybrid, and one in-person). At these events, 93 participants were trained directly. Out of 93 participants, 66 attended the events virtually and 27 - in person; 5 were the early-career professionals at both the PhD-granting and the primarily undergraduate institutions; 35% of participants were female, 50% were international attendees of various enthnicities and races. The project directly supported research activities and cyberinfrastructure training of several graduate students in the PI&rsquo;s lab. Through frliendly, welcoming, and informal settings, the project helped promore inclusivity, comaradery, and cooperation among the participants and created a rich networking experience for students, postdocs, and instructors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beyond the direct training of the workshop participants, the project has had a much broader impact via online dissemination. The videorecordings created the project duration have been viewed or downloaded more than 3400 times. They attracted more than 1000 unique viewers and delivered nearly 700 hours of content. A number of meaningful research projects have started among the participants and instructors. There are many more users of the Libra package now than it was as of the start of the project. Developing the Libra educational materials stimulated the development of a simplified, user-friendly, and more streamlined interface of the code, positively affecting its adoption. Some workshop participants have not only used the code for their studies, but have contributed new methodological implementation to this code and stimulated their home-groups to start using this package in their research. In addition, via the Slack (<a href=\"https://slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://slack.com/</a>) platform, we fostered the community of more than 360 computational chemists working on modeling nonadiabatic and quantum dynamics. To date, the dedicated &ldquo;Quantum Dynamics Hub&rdquo; channel serves as the dedicated platform for discussions, announcements, and problem-solving for researchers who use such cyberinfrastructure in various areas of quantum dynamics and material research.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/17/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alexey&nbsp;V&nbsp;Akimov</p>\n</div>\n<div
