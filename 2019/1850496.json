 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tiny energy harvesting computers tap into the sun, radio waves, vibration, and other sources to power all their sensing, computing, and communication tasks. By leaving batteries behind, these devices can function maintenance-free, potentially for decades, enabling numerous applications in the Internet-of-Things. These battery-free devices can lose power at any point because of fluctuations in energy availability, which makes programming, debugging, and deployment challenging. The goal of this project is to develop the systems and tools that make these devices resilient to power failures, dependable, easier to program, and able to function in unpredictable environmental and energy conditions.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of this project are focused on improving adaptivity, programmability, reliability, and applicability of intermittent computing devices. Three complementary research thrusts are pursued: 1) development of a rigorous classification of energy harvesting environments built on identifying unique energy modes, aiding in application design; 2) prototyping a novel recognition circuit for anticipating changes in the energy harvesting environment or energy mode based on remanence decay; 3) development of a task-based programming language with built-in adaptation semantics leveraging energy modes and the recognition circuitry with accompanying low overhead runtime system.\r\n\r\nThe work in this project develops adaptive systems and tooling for intermittent computers that will enable even novices to build reliable and long-lived sensor devices. By making application development easier, and improving availability (and reliability), these systems will positively impact applications in healthcare (wearable and body sensor networks), defense, ecology, horticulture, infrastructure, wildlife tracking, space exploration, and many other areas where long-term, low cost, massive scale sensing is essential. \r\n\r\nAll hardware, software, and collected environmental profiles and energy traces will be made freely available, along with documentation and tutorials. These project artifacts will be stored in a dedicated repository for scientists, educators, hobbyists, and industry to access and use.   This repository will be maintained for at least three years after the duration of the project. \r\n(https://gitlab.com/ka-moamoa/battery-free-sensing)\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Unfortunately, today's smart devices have short battery lifetimes, high installation and maintenance costs, and rapid obsolescence- all leading to the explosion of electronic waste in the past two decades. These problems will worsen as the number of connected devices grows to one trillion in the next few decades. As a response, this project explored battery-less, energy-harvesting devices as a sustainable alternative. Ambient energy from sunlight, motion, thermal gradients, and even microbes can be stored in small capacitors to power computation, sensing, actuation, and communication. Building useful applications on these battery-free devices is challenging, as they compute intermittently due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of energy harvesting.

Specifically, the project developed (i) characterizations of energy harvesting environments to aid in understanding how to change computing tasks based on the energy available, and a circuit design to keep time across power failures to enable intelligent change (ii) several lightweight adaptive runtime systems that provide various guarantees of execution and programmer-focused tools to build deployment-ready power failure resilient applications, (iii) the first Python interpreter that can run on intermittent power, and (iv) the worlds first battery-free Game Boy, which was the first demonstration of virtualizing a large legacy codebase to run on intermittent power, and one of the first demonstrations of interactive intermittent computing.<br /><br />The project laid the foundations for further study of intermittent computing runtime systems, hardware, and applications.
