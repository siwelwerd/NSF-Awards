 "awd_abstract_narration": "The instrumentation project focuses on the purchase of an isotope ratio mass spectrometer with a gas chromatographic front end.  Specifically the proposal request will customize a new gas source isotope ratio mass spectrometer with a gas chromatographic inlet (GC-IRMS) for measurement of the stable isotopes of nitrate and nitrous oxide. Technological advances in analytical chemistry and instrumentation over the last several decades improved the sensitivity and precision of these measurements, which in turn expanded the understanding of the nitrogen biogeochemical cycles. The environmental properties of the N cycle are in turn key to the health of global agriculture, extra-terrestrial ecology and marine productivity.    \r\n\r\nAcquisition of a customized GC-IRMS will allow more and improved stable isotope measurements to be made at URI. Recent technological advances provide enhanced sensitivity and precision, up to a 3-fold improvement from  current capabilities. This should allow researchers to address questions on samples with limited availability for analysis or that require greater precision, or both.\r\nThe enhanced isotope infrastructure and expertise at GSO will attract talented new students, postdocs, and faculty to GSO, providing them with marketable skills in cutting edge analytical techniques. This will in turn facilitate improved training opportunities that promote diversity and inclusion in STEM fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharacteristics of this proposal that align with MRI and EPSCoR co-funding guidelines include: collaboration with researchers at other universities in the US and abroad; provides instrumentation for stable isotope research education; integration of research and education through training opportunities for students and incorporation in college courses.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by Antarctic Sciences,  Office of Polar Programs (OPP), by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and MRI, the Major Instrumentation Research Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
