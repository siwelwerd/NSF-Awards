 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will help to address a critical need for patients who have suffered an infection in a total knee replacement joint.  Unfortunately, doctors have few good options for effectively treating this type of infection to avoid the potential for limb amputation or even death should the infection persist and spread.  Today, treatment requires surgical replacement of part or all of the existing implant while using oral or intravenous antibiotics.  Due to the capsule around the joint (isolated from blood vessels) these methods deliver marginal amounts of antibiotic within the knee where the bacteria reside.  Patients suffer elongated treatment, many times without the use of their knee, waiting for the bacterial infection to slowly resolve.   ForCast Orthopedics' Antibiotic Dispensing Knee Spacer provides a refillable reservoir within the artificial knee that can distribute antibiotic directly into the knee capsule for effective infection treatment.  Physicians can prescribe the antibiotic most appropriate for the bacteria diagnosed.  The patient returns to the doctor's office once per week for a checkup and antibiotic refill injection until the infection is cured.  No follow up surgery is required. Duplicating the antibiotic delivery of previous successful clinical studies (using representative but intolerable daily injections) should result in similar highly successful patient outcomes, reduced patient suffering and reduced healthcare costs.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project addresses an underserved clinical need for improved treatment of Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI).  Today, doctors have few good options for treatment to avoid the potential for limb amputation or even death should PJI persist and spread.  All methods require surgical debridement and replacement of part or all of the existing implant (to reduce bacterial load) while using oral or intravenous antibiotics that cannot reach the remaining bacteria within the knee capsule (blood/synovial fluid barrier). Temporary eluting antibiotic spacers and beads are too short lived. Patients suffer elongated treatment, many times without a load-bearing knee.  ForCast Orthopedics is developing an Antibiotic Dispensing Spacer (AD Spacer) to replace the standard spacer in a total knee implant.  The AD Spacer provides a refillable reservoir to hold the antibiotic of choice for the bacteria identified and a delivery system to maintain a therapeutic concentration within the knee for the entire therapy duration, typically a minimum of 6 weeks. As a permanent spacer, no further surgery is required after treatment.  Emulating the delivery characteristics of previously successful clinical studies (using intolerable daily injections) should result in similar highly successful patient outcomes, reduced morbidity and reduced total cost of care.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nForCast Orthopedics is pursuing a novel, improved treatment for bacterial infection of patients who previously have had a total joint (a hip or knee) replacement. This is referred to as periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Patients with these implants are susceptible to PJI from the primary surgery, or from blood-borne sources from other injuries over their lifetime.  Today, physicians lack an effective treatment approach wherein the success rate for infection resolution may vary between 50% - 90%.  All procedures are surgical and persistent infection may require multiple procedures or amputation.  Surgery varies based upon the approach but when the implant is removed to treat infection (about 70-80% of the time), bone loss results, treatment costs increase and patients disability/recovery is extended, sometimes up to a year impacting the patients work life, financial abilities and standard of living.   Further, the most common treatment, that removes and replaces the implant to treat the infection, has a 5 year survival rate below either breast or prostate cancer survival.   At ForCast we're focused on retaining most of the original implant, presuming it is mechanically sound, and effectively treating the infection with the implant in place.  This will reduce healthcare costs and patient suffering.\n\nFor infected patients with a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) implant, our approach is to replace a common component of the existing implant.  A plastic spacer resides between the two primary metal components secured to bone.  This spacer is snapped out and simply replaced with our ADK (antibiotic dispensing knee) Spacer.  Our ADK Spacer contains a small antibiotic reservoir within it that does not affect the ability of the Spacer to perform its mechanical-orthopedic function.  Through an external control, it doses the internal antibiotic into the synovial fluid inside the knee capsule to directly treat the bacterial infection where it occurs.  Published clinical studies demonstrate that direct injection of antibiotic into the joint can generate and maintain antibiotic concentrations much higher than what is achieved when patients are given antibiotics intravenously (IV), the current standard of care.  IV antibiotic administration does not penetrate joint capsules effectively.  Other forms of local antibiotic delivery into the knee capsule, e.g. temporary antibiotic impregnated cement or asorbable antibiotic beads, cannot maintain therapeutic concentrations of antibiotic in the synovial fluid the over needed time to be highly effective.  Our ADK Spacer is refillable through a simple periodic injection maintaining the needed high antibiotic concentrations to effectively kill the bacterial infection within the knee.  We look forward to seeing successful patient outcomes much higher than current standard of care due to this local, controlled antibiotic delivery.  Note, we're using existing/available antibiotics that are proven to work against these known bacteria.  We are simply improving how to deliver and control the local dosing of these antibiotics where it is needed most for effective treatment.\n\nOur NSF SBIR Phase I project successfully completed initial engineering work to demonstrate that our ADK Spacer prototype could achieve the requirements for a mechanical-orthopedic implant, an implantable drug delivery system, and to identify our first selected antibiotic for further pre-clinical testing of our device. Our efforts ecompased mechanical design analysis, prototype integration, testing to industry standards along with chemical and microbiological analyses.  This was critically important work to advance our understanding of a successful device and to accelerate our effort to commercialize our first products.  We're very appreciative of NSF's support to advance our efforts for improving patient treatment. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/20/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeff Castleberry"
