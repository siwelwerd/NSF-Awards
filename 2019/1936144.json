 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Clarkson University ADVANCE Adaptation project, STEM LEAF (STEM Leadership, Equity, and Advancement for Faculty) will improve equity for STEM faculty at Clarkson. The project has three goals: (1) to significantly reduce implicit or unintentional bias associated with gender and its intersections with race and ethnicity, country of origin, sexual orientation, and disability; (2) to support the development of inclusive leadership skills by department chairs, center/institute directors, and deans, and (3) to promote the sustainability of these systemic efforts through university-wide structural and policy changes.\r\n\r\nOne component of the STEM LEAF project is the adaptation of the Advocates and Allies model developed by North Dakota State University.  The adaptation of the model will include the infusion of intersectionality into the model.  In addition, new programs to support the development of department chairs and deans and facilitate community building and problem solving among current and future leaders will be implemented.  In order to weave these activities into the fabric of Clarkson's climate and culture, a comprehensive revision of policies and practices will be undertaken, starting with chairs' duties to ensure they reflect the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion expected at Clarkson.  The adaptation of evidence-based activities combined with structural changes to policies and practices will foster a change in climate and culture at Clarkson University which is a private technological university located in the rural North Country of New York State.\r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.  ADVANCE \"Adaptation\" awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based strategies to academic, non-profit institution of higher education as well as non-academic, non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
