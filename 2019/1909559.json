 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thanks to major advances in laser technology, there is an ongoing interest in the study of light interacting with matter, in particular for intense laser beams propagating long distances in the atmosphere. Laser pulses exceeding tens of gigawatts power can be used in many applications including remote sensing through Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), lightning and weather control and free-space optics communication. Current research on free space optical communications (FSO), both classical and quantum, is intended to facilitate exchange of information within a network of satellites, between the Earth and satellites and between the Earth and drones. This and other aspects to be studied, such as diffraction control, are in line with topics within Quantum Leap, one of the NSF's 10 Big Ideas. In searching for optimal performance, it is critical to seek better understanding of a range of spatial and temporal effects that take place while light interacts with molecules in the atmosphere. For this, proper mathematical and numerical modeling assist experimentalists to for example consider novel modes of propagation (optical filaments versus vortex filaments) and the possible coexistence of multi- color (multi-frequency) filaments. Research performed under this award will have a strong synergy with experimental groups, enriching the interdisciplinary nature of the project and enhancing the learning experience of applied mathematics graduate students to be trained in a multifaceted approach.\r\n\r\nUnder the general theme of light matter interactions, the PI and students will investigate spatiotemporal dynamics of light propagation in nonlinear media. The research addresses well defined questions related to the characterization of highly nonlinear optical modes of different types  (filament modes, vortex modes and combinations) in three different media: air (Kerr media), carrying two frequencies (typically ultraviolet and infrared), nonlinear crystals (quadratic media) where little is known on the theory of filament formation at phase mismatch  and on the formation of filaments in discrete/continuum nonlinear media with fractional diffraction and quadratic dispersion. The first two topics represent significant extensions of ongoing research in filament science, based either on recent experimental observations or potential new experiments on which the PI has been and will be directly involved. By the nature and objectives of the research, the effort supported by this award will benefit from continuing interactions with several experimental teams.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
