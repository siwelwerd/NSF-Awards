 "awd_abstract_narration": "As anyone who has seen the display of a peacock can attest, communication signals form some of the most striking features of animal diversity on our planet.  A fundamental question to be answered is, under what conditions do elaborate communication signals develop?  To address this, a series of experiments will be conducted on two inhabitants of the Central American rainforest, the tungara frog, and its predator, the frog-eating bat.  Male tungara frogs vocalize in the noisy backdrop of the rainforest as they attempt to attract a mate. While vocalizing, the frogs also inflate a large sac in their throat which generates a cascade of water ripples surrounding them.  The experiments will address how and when each of these different signal components is used by a female frog searching for a mate or a bat searching for a meal. A common assumption in studies of animal behavior is that, additional information in an animal's signal always improves the ability of signal recipients to locate that signaler.  In studies on humans, however, it is understood that more information can lead to cognitive overload and degrade decision performance.  This study will address the conditions under which added information improves or degrades the efficiency of animal communication signals.  The project will also incorporate training of future scientists, ranging from undergraduate students to post-doctoral researchers.  Further, the knowledge gained from the project will be disseminated through student training at universities and primary schools as well as public outreach through museum displays.\r\n     \r\nA fundamental question in animal behavior is, how do animals utilize available information to inform adaptive behaviors? In behavioral ecology there is often the implicit assumption that more information is better. In human psychophysics, however, there is substantial evidence to show that more information can lead to cognitive overload and disrupt signal detection and decision-making. Previous results from the investigators have made it clear that information in the male tungara frog's mating display is not linearly related to the response of two receivers, the female frog or its predator, the frog-eating bat. To address the question, \"is more information always better,\" a series of playback experiments will be conducted under conditions of increasingly complex multimodal background noise.  These experimental noise levels will mimic the variable noise levels that occur naturally in the environment. The performance (decision accuracy and latency) of the two receivers (female frog and bat predator) to playback calls will be assessed, making a critical contribution to an understanding of how animal decision-making occurs in a complex world. This will be the first study to explicitly contrast hypotheses that added information in the environment leads to either enhanced performance or cognitive overload on the part of the receiver. An added value of this study is that it will yield information on two very different species, with fundamentally different sensory systems and cognitive abilities.  This will enhance the generality of the interpretations, providing insights into how different cognitive systems deal with environmental noise.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Many of these decisions have profound effects on an animal&rsquo;s reproductive success and survivorship. All of these decisions are influenced by the information that animals gather from their social and biotic environment.</p>\r\n<p>Given the importance of information for making critical decisions, one would think that more information is always better&mdash;and this is <em>often</em> the case. But we know that it is not <em>always</em> the case. In aviation, for example, adding data about the status of an aircraft may become a distraction as it contributes to cognitive overload. In our studies we contrast two hypotheses: additional information either (H<sub>1</sub>) enhances performance or (H<sub>2</sub>) causes cognitive overload.</p>\r\n<p>We investigated how female frogs choose mates using information imparted by the male&rsquo;s mating display. There are potentially three sources of information available to the females. The females primarily rely on acoustic information in a male&rsquo;s call, but they are also attentive to the visual cue of the inflating and deflating vocal sac as well as the ripples (seismic) on the water&rsquo;s surface that results from vocal sac movements (Fig 1).</p>\r\n<p>Our <strong>first aim</strong> was to determine if different information streams of the frog&rsquo;s mating display are redundant. The amplitude of the call was best correlated with the volume of the vocal sac, and information provided by the three sources combined, acoustic, visual and seismic, are better predictors of male body size than any of these cues by themselves (Fig 2). Thus, more information is available when all three stimuli combine. The question we then pursued is do females use all this information?</p>\r\n<p>We know that information often needs to be extracted from a noisy environment (just reflect on the problem of talking with someone at a noisy cocktail party). Thus, our <strong>second aim</strong> was to determine if additional information enhances the female frog&rsquo;s ability to identify the attractive male in the presence of noise (Fig. 3). In a quiet environment females were given a choice between two identical complex calls (unimodal, sound only). There was no preference between these two calls. But adding the visual and seismic cues to one of the calls (now multimodal) made them more attractive to females. In another experiment females were given a choice between a complex call and a simple call. In the absence of noise, females preferred the complex call, whether both calls were unimodal or multimodal. The preference for the complex call disappeared in the presence of noise when both calls were unimodal, but the preference was resurrected in the presence of noise when both calls were multimodal. These results show that the addition of information to both of the stimuli allowed females to discriminate the two calls against the background noise. This phenomenon is referred to as cross-modal facilitation, a phenomenon known in humans but hardly investigated in other animals.</p>\r\n<p>In the <strong>third aim</strong> of our study we determined if the addition of multimodal stimuli to a previously determined unattractive call would cause females to change their preference to the unattractive call. The presence of noise or of a multimodal unattractive call did not reduce female preferences for attractive calls. In the presence of noise, however, the females&rsquo; preference was flipped, they were more likely to choose an unattractive call coupled with the visual component (Fig. 4).</p>\r\n<p>In summary, we have shown that the interplay between different amounts of information can enhance detection of signals in a noisy environment, supporting the &lsquo;more information is better&rsquo; hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>). However, in specific cases, extra information can cause females to switch their mating decisions to unattractive calls in the presence of noise, supporting the &lsquo;cognitive overload&rsquo; hypothesis (H<sub>2</sub>). We cannot assume that more information is always better, nor can we assume that it is always detrimental. Instead, the interactions of different streams of information are context-dependent and influenced by the presence and absence of noise.</p>\r\n<p>While completing this research, we were also involved in activities to enhance the broader impact of this work. While in the field, we participated in multiple visits from local Panamanian schools, teaching students about the various frogs of Panama. We also participated in the monthly &lsquo;bat nights&rsquo;, a busy public outreach event where we demonstrated the t&uacute;ngara frog courtship system to attendees, and we helped organize the weekly &lsquo;frog talks&rsquo; for researchers to share their preliminary findings. Finally, the work from these projects was presented at various international research conferences, including multiple Animal Behavior Society meetings, as well as the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute&rsquo;s fellows&rsquo; symposium.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/02/2024<br>\nModified by: Michael&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ryan</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1914652/1914652_10600077_1731969291510_NSF_facilitation--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1914652/1914652_10600077_1731969291510_NSF_facilitation--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cross-modal facilitation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1914652/1914652_10600077_1731969291510_NSF_facilitation--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cross-modal facilitation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 3. \n\nLeft.
