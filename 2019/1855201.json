 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site will be established at Purdue University Northwest (PNW)'s Center for Innovation through Visualization and Simulation (CIVS).  It will address critical issues of workforce development and skills gap in industry, which have direct impact on the nation's prosperity. The site will provide high school and community college STEM teachers with research experiences and development opportunities to enhance their STEM understanding and teaching effectiveness using virtual learning tools to increase their students' STEM interest, understanding, and activities. Through the research activities, teachers will participate in ongoing, modern systems engineering and smart manufacturing research using cutting-edge simulation and visualization technologies in collaboration with CIVS research staff, PNW engineering faculty, and industry collaborators. The research will address real world industry issues to increase energy efficiency, optimize production, predict mechanical failures, and improve product quality and safety in industrial workplace settings. Recruitment efforts will target underrepresented minority school districts and teachers, and historically STEM-underserved populations, to bolster growth and diversity in future STEM educational options, career paths, and research infrastructure. From their exciting research experiences, participants will create and implement virtual learning modules into their own classrooms during the academic year. Through these modules, which link the research experiences to STEM education standards and promote investigational and analytical skills, students will be empowered and encouraged to pursue advanced STEM education and career goals. The proposed site will also impact a regional workforce and economy strongly tied to the steel industry, with Indiana producing 25% of the nation's steel. \r\n\r\nEach summer for 6 weeks, Purdue Northwest will host 12 teachers from Northwest Indiana high schools and community colleges that reflect both the diversity of their student populations and the manufacturing/ industry base of their communities. Program objectives are to (1) provide these teachers with authentic research experiences using advanced simulation and visualization technologies for innovative industrial solutions and model-based manufacturing, (2) translate teacher's research experiences and new knowledge into curricular modules, using existing real-world virtual industrial processes, that will be implemented in their STEM classes during the academic year, and (3) build a community of educators and engineers who will continue to mentor and advance STEM learning to students throughout the academic year. Five research projects that address real-world engineering/technology issues in the steel industry, and focus on advancements in model- and sensor-based manufacturing are offered. Participants will be mentored by teams consisting of engineering faculty, graduate students, and industry engineers, within a project-based learning system. The projects, professional development and research dissemination opportunities, and continuous program assessment and improvement protocols, all build on and leverage the considerable resources of Purdue Northwest's CIVS research center and Steel Manufacturing Simulation and Visualization Consortium (SMSVC), which have become marquee names in steel manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
