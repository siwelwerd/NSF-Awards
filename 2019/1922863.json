 "awd_abstract_narration": "This student travel grant is to enhance the education of selected US graduate students in the research area of Logic Programming. This will be realized by enabling them to attend the 2019 International Conference in Logic Programming (ICLP), which will include a logic programming Doctoral Consortium (DC) and a Fall School in Logic Programming (FSLP) for these students.  An important focus of the conference is to improve student education in the field of Logic Programming.  The conference organization and governance include many prominent researchers in the area. The conference will help nurture the next generation of ICLP researchers by enabling students to meet senior researchers at the conference and take part in face-to-face discussions with them.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed activity furthers technological advancement in the area of logic programming, which is currently seeing substantial industrial interest. ICLP has been the premier international event for presenting research in logic programming in areas including foundations, languages, declarative programming, logic solver implementation, and applications. Contributions are sought in all areas of logic programming.  Supporting the educational mission of the conference will bring long-term benefits to both industry and academia.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
