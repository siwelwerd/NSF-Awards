 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to realize legged co-robots that cooperatively work with each other or people to achieve a variety of tasks in complex environments. One of the most challenging problems in deploying the next generation of ubiquitous co-robots is mobility in complex environments. More than half of the Earth's landmass is inaccessible to wheeled vehicles this motivates utilizing legged co-robots to access these environments and thus bring robots into the real world. Legged robots that are augmented with manipulators can form co-robot teams that assist humans in different aspects of their life. Although important theoretical and technological advances have enabled the development of distributed controllers for complex robot systems, including multiagent systems composed of collaborative robotic arms, multifingered robot hands, aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles, understanding how to control cooperative legged agents is an open problem.  The challenges in achieving coordination in this domain stems from the fact that legged robots are inherently unstable, and the evolution of legged co-robot teams is represented by high-dimensional and complex hybrid dynamical systems which complicate the design of distributed control algorithms for control and coordination. There is a fundamental gap in knowledge of distributed control algorithms for safety-critical control of these inherently unstable, underactuated, and complex hybrid dynamical systems.  The overarching goal of this proposal is to create a formal foundation, based on hybrid systems theory, scalable optimization, and robust and safety-critical control, to develop distributed and hierarchical feedback control algorithms for cooperative legged co-robots with manipulators to achieve a variety of tasks in complex environments. The proposed research will have broad societal impact through the formally principled and safety-critical deployment of ubiquitous collaborative legged robots in scenarios where robots can assist humans, e.g., disaster response. The integrated educational plan will have broad impact by designing a new course based upon the results, utilizing robots for STEM-based outreach for K-12 students, teachers, and under-represented minorities.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to develop resilient and versatile algorithms that address cooperative locomotion and manipulation of high-dimensional hybrid models of legged co-robot teams in a safe, stable, and reliable manner. These algorithms will further enable legged co-robot teams to adapt to new tasks and environments with minimal modification to software. It will advance knowledge in the largely unexplored field of distributed control of large-scale hybrid system models of legged co-robots through specific objectives and key innovations in Scalability and Customizability. Intelligent and optimization-based motion planning algorithms will be created for hybrid models of legged co-robots to adapt to a wide variety of complex environments and new situations. Distributed and hierarchical control algorithms, based on nonlinear, robust and predictive controllers, together with scalable convex optimization, will be developed for coordination of multiagent legged robotic systems to enable agile locomotion patterns while manipulating objects in a dexterous manner. Finally, safety-critical control methods, based on set invariance and convex optimization, will be integrated with the hierarchical and distributed controllers for obstacle avoidance. To bridge the gap between theory and implementation, the proposed research will transfer the theoretical innovations into practice through experiments with a co-robot team consisting of multiple quadruped robots and one humanoid robot working collaboratively.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Human-centered communities, including factories, offices, and homes, are developed for humans who are bipedal walkers capable of stepping over gaps and walking up/down stairs. Legged robots that are augmented with manipulators can form co-robot teams that assist humans in different aspects of their lives, such as labor-intensive tasks, construction, and assembly. Although significant theoretical and technological advances have allowed the development of distributed controllers for motion control of complex robot systems, state-of-the-art approaches address the control of multiagent systems composed of collaborative robotic arms, aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles, but not cooperative-legged agents. Legged robots are inherently unstable, unlike most systems where these algorithms have been deployed. Furthermore, the evolution of legged co-robot teams that cooperatively manipulate objects can be represented by high-dimensional and complex hybrid dynamical systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This work established a formal foundation based on scalable optimization, predictive control, and robust nonlinear control to develop distributed and hierarchical feedback control algorithms for safe motion control of cooperative-legged robots with manipulators. This was a collaborative project between Virginia Tech (VT) and Caltech.</p>\n<p>In terms of Intellectual Merit, multiple innovative, distributed, and layered control design methods were developed under this work, and each has been investigated on different multi-agent-legged robotic systems. The first approach presented a layered control approach for real-time trajectory planning and control of robust cooperative locomotion by two holonomically constrained quadrupedal robots. A novel interconnected network of reduced-order models, based on the single rigid body (SRB) dynamics, was developed for trajectory planning purposes. At the higher level of the control architecture, two different model predictive control (MPC) algorithms were proposed to address the optimal control problem of the interconnected SRB dynamics: centralized and distributed MPCs. The distributed MPC assumes two local quadratic programs (QPs) that share their optimal solutions according to a one-step communication delay and an agreement protocol. At the lower level of the control scheme, distributed nonlinear controllers were developed to impose the full-order dynamics to track the prescribed reduced-order trajectories generated by MPCs. The effectiveness of the control approach was verified with extensive numerical simulations and experiments for the robust and cooperative locomotion of two holonomically constrained A1 quadrupedal robots with different payloads on variable terrains and in the presence of disturbances. It is shown that the distributed MPC performs similarly to that of the centralized MPC while the computation time is reduced significantly.</p>\n<p>Second, the work created a real-time, distributed, and data-driven trajectory planner that enables legged locomotion for complex multiagent systems consisting of several autonomically constrained quadrupeds. To this end, a methodology based on behavioral systems theory was employed to model the sophisticated and high-dimensional structure induced by the holonomic constraints. The resulting model was then used in tandem with distributed control techniques to share the computational burden across agents. Finally, this distributed model is framed in the context of a predictive controller, resulting in a robustly stable method for trajectory planning. This methodology was tested in simulation with up to five agents and was further experimentally validated on three A1 quadrupedal robots subject to various uncertainties, including payloads, rough terrain, and push disturbances.</p>\n<p>Third, the work developed a computationally effective and distributed trajectory planner at the intersection of physics-based and data-driven techniques for the collaborative locomotion of holonomically constrained quadrupedal robots that can account for and attenuate interaction forces between subsystems.&nbsp;Fourth, the work presented a formal foundation to systematically decompose QP-based centralized nonlinear controllers into a network of lower-dimensional local QPs, with application to legged locomotion. Finally, the work presented a hierarchical control strategy based on hybrid systems theory, nonlinear control, and safety-critical systems to enable cooperative locomotion of robotic guide dogs and visually impaired people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />In terms of broader impacts, unlike state-of-the-art techniques that only address planning and control of single-agent legged robots, the proposed approach can address complex and agile locomotion of legged co-robot teams that safely manipulate objects in complex environments. This control technology will, therefore, overcome the critical roadblocks to deploying legged co-robots that cooperatively work with each other or people for various tasks in different aspects of human society, such as labor-intensive tasks, construction, manufacturing, assembly, and disaster response. Regarding education, multiple Ph.D. students at VT were supported via this project to work on their dissertations and publications. In addition, two innovative graduate courses were created for the mechanical engineering curriculum at VT, namely \"Feedback Control of Dynamic Legged Locomotion\" and \"Model Predictive Control for Agile Robots.\" The PI and his team hosted frequent lab tours for K-12 students and participated in STEM demos for events, such as VT Open Houses and VT Science Festival. In addition, the PI had multiple invited talks and interviews related to this work, including a TEDx talk.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/02/2023<br>\nModified by: Kaveh&nbsp;Akbari
