The Principle Investigator is Mary Kirchhoff of the American Chemical Society. The overall goal is to host a colloquium on Nov. 20th, 2019, that highlights the chemistry breakthroughs enabled by the understanding of the periodic chart. The United Nations' General Assembly has decreed 2019 as the International Year of the Periodic Table (IYPT). This is the American Chemical Society's culminating event. This event will engage ACS members and enhance public appreciation for chemistry. \r\n\r\nThis event will gather highly respected chemists to present on overarching topics in areas of current public and chemistry community interest, such as sustainable plastics, quantum computing, and batteries. By tying these topics back to the history of the periodic chart and linking them to the future research areas of chemistry, the broader community (through web access), the local higher education community (by invitation), and the general D.C. scientific community can be linked for this celebratory event.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
