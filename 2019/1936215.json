There will also be a poster session for all researchers to showcase their work, and a special panel on open questions for graduate students and early career researchers.   This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not funded by NSF, an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.  More information will be made available at:  http://www.math.kent.edu/~zvavitch/informal/Informal_Analysis_Seminar/Welcome.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
