 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many primate species, males have much larger canines than do females, a character known as canine sexual dimorphism. In humans, the canines of males and females are very similar in size (monomorphic). This doctoral research project investigates the evolution and function of large male canine teeth in a model primate species to better understand potential selection pressures for dimorphism, and to use as comparative data to understand why the loss of this feature evolved in humans. This project provides training opportunities in both fieldwork and data analysis for undergraduate and graduate students in New York and Puerto Rico. \r\n\r\nThis study will integrate morphological, genetic, and behavioral data to test the hypothesis that large male canines are a sexually selected signal and/or weapon in primates. This project also explores mechanisms of canine size evolution (heritability and selection). The Co-PI will collect data on canine size to investigate how canine size is inherited and whether canine size predicts reproductive success. She will also conduct field experiments to determine if males and females attend to differences in male canine size. Finally, she will integrate canine size data with behavioral data to assess whether canine size predicts the occurrence and outcome of fights between males. The results of this project will contribute knowledge about the mechanisms behind both the evolution of canine dimorphism and the loss of this character in humans.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
