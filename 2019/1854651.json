 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Field Museum Professor Ryan Williams, David A. Reid, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois at Chicago, along with colleagues in Peru, will investigate the role of road infrastructure in the political economy of expansionary states and its impact on borderland communities. This project focuses on the relationship between imperial expansion and consolidation and the networks of long-distance communication, travel, and commerce, of which road and waystation infrastructure were the direct conduits. As mobility routes are consistently reused over time, the discipline of archaeology is well positioned to understand how changes in infrastructure relate to broader socio-economic and political shifts on long time-scales. In what ways do expansionary states rely on local knowledge to coopt and develop networks of infrastructure? How does greater economic connectivity between a state center and borderland societies contribute to changes in ideology and social identity? As modern networks of travel and communication become increasingly accelerated and connected, the researchers will investigate the deep roots of interregional connectivity and the role of infrastructure in the processes of state-building. This project contributes to the professional training of undergraduate and graduate students from both the United States and Peru. Results of this research will be shared through articles published in both Spanish and English, conference papers, and through community outreach activities. \r\n\r\nReid and his research team will examine how roads, including sites that served as rest stops and places of exchange, were implemented by both outside state agents and local communities. This research will be conducted in the Majes Valley of Arequipa, a key corridor of travel between the Andean highlands and Peru's southern coastal valleys. This region was an important borderland of Peru's first empire: the Wari whose material culture and customs spread across much of Peru during the Middle Horizon (ca. AD 600-1000). The researchers will analyze archaeological materials recovered from excavations of four caravan waystation sites that indicate both a local and Wari foundation for this road network. A diverse set of materials and methods will be employed, including material provenance analyses to understand the movement of trade goods such as ceramics and obsidian, botanical analysis to reconstruct past foodways, and C14 dating to understand the chronology and development of the waystation system. The presence of ritual spaces, including a Wari temple, at the road waystation sites also inform us on the role of religion and ritual in processes of state expansion. Consequently, this project examines how road infrastructure and associated sites facilitate processes of economic exchange, ritual practice, and socio-political integration of local communities into projects of the state.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The goal of this project was to understand the role of road infrastructure (i.e. the built networks of communication, travel, and commerce) in processes of imperial expansion and consolidation of one of South America's first empires: the Wari of Peru.

The extent and political boundaries of the Wari empire remain little understood. However, through the study of road infrastructure and its related materials, this investigation found conclusive evidence of a Wari state occupation and temple center at the site Pakaytambo.

Although materials from Wari contexts show high affinity and connections to the state heartland, geochemical analyses show artifacts are of local origin, likely related to the empire's consolidation of regional resources including obsidian and clay deposits. Materials from the local waystations indicate the long-distance movement of materials (likely by llama caravans) from the Wari heartland in the south-central highlands to Peru's southern coastal valleys. These local waystations likely developed to take advantage of new economic opportunities related to Wari's imperial expansion, and served as places of trade, ceremony, and even feasting for local groups. The presence of ritual spaces, including a Wari temple, at the road waystation sites also inform us on the role of religion and ritual in processes of state expansion. The Wari state not only integrated local peoples into their political and economic systems, but also exported their religious and social practices into new regions of the empire.</p>\n<p>This project had significant impacts on local communities and individuals and provided training and educational opportunities to young scientists and students in Peru and the United States.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/01/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;Reid</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1854651/1854651_10586995_1606845587537_Figure03caragollete--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1854651/1854651_10586995_1606845587537_Figure03caragollete--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Wari style face-neck jar fragment.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1854651/1854651_10586995_1606845587537_Figure03caragollete--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Wari style face-neck jar fragment.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Materials recovered from the study sites, such as fragments of ceramic vessels, show strong connections to Wari material culture and influence.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Reid</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;Reid</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Wari style face-neck jar fragment.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1854651/1854651_10586995_1606845394429_Figure02Pakaytambo--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1854651/1854651_10586995_1606845394429_Figure02Pakaytambo--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Wari Enclave and Temple Center at Pakaytambo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1854651/1854651_10586995_1606845394429_Figure02Pakaytambo--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Wari Enclave and Temple Center at Pakaytambo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Following Wari imperial architectural styles, the site Pakaytambo is located on a road that connects the Peruvian highlands to the Pacific Coast.
