 "awd_abstract_narration": "Across the animal kingdom, pigmentation patterns are subject to change in novel and fluctuating environments. Color variation among cichlid fish in the East African Great Lakes is a hallmark driving their speciation in one of the largest adaptive radiations recorded among vertebrates. This project will explore how a \"molecular switch\", DNA methylation, can change the function of genes in the pigment cells of a color-changing cichlid fish adapting to the algal blooms of Lake Tanganyika.  The study of these reversible color changing processes will improve the understanding of the fluidity that exists between a static genome and an animals' need to adapt to an ever-changing environment. The principal investigator (PI) will carry out this research at an institute that primarily serves under-represented minorities in science at the undergraduate and graduate level in the largest most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. In addition to training opportunities in his laboratory, the PI will share the relevance of environment-by-gene interactions to underprivileged youths during two-week workshops held in Santiago, Chile, where the PI will teach the relevance of the genetic determinants that affect human health and disease and the plastic molecular mechanisms that change with socio-economic position, adversity, and mental illness.\r\n\r\nAnimal pigmentation is a salient trait across the animal kingdom that allows an individual to become cryptic, predatory, or sexually attractive. The project will use Astatotilapia burtoni, an African cichlid fish, with robust and reversible color morphs to develop the understanding of the role DNA methylation plays in the function of pigment-bearing cells during changes in pigmentation. Previous work by this PI has shown that these morphs are accompanied by alterations in DNA methylation of the Endothelin Receptor B promoter and this project will expand this role in the field, across the genome, and through their upstream signaling cascades. Using a combination of satellite imaging, in situ measurements of lake morphology, high throughput sequencing, pharmacology, and cell sorting, the project will characterize and dissect this ecologically relevant trait that is ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom. The strength of this proposal lies within its interdisciplinary integration of environmental measures in the field to reveal a comprehensive understanding of visual ecology with experimental validation carried out in the laboratory. The project will also resolve the function of pigment-bearing cells across an entire animal into enriched cell populations that directly correspond to the trait in question, thus eliminating hurdles of cell heterogeneity that typically limit the interpretation of these studies. It is anticipated that the findings from this study will be widely relevant to the field of evolution, visual ecology, and cellular biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

African cichlids show a diverse and plastic repertoire of colors important for their speciation in the Eastern Rift Lakes. Specifically,&nbsp;<em>Astatotilapia burtoni&nbsp;</em>is a powerful model for studying the intricate relationship between phenotypic plasticity and social behavior. Native to Lake Tanganyika, this cichlid exhibits remarkable color variation and dynamic changes in coloration as a function of their social status. This color plasticity is a striking example of the species' broader capacity to adapt to changing environmental and social conditions. However, little is known about how such plasticity is governed at the cellular-molecular level. In this proposal, we suggest that epigenetic mechanisms, particularly DNA methylation, regulate coloration, highlighting the importance of non-genetic factors in shaping phenotype. This system is advantageous for investigating how gene expression can be modified without changes to the underlying DNA sequence and how these modifications lead to complex behaviors and patterning/coloration. By examining the interplay between environmental signals, social interactions, and epigenetic changes in&nbsp;<em>A. burtoni</em>, we have gained critical insights into the mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity, which are broadly relevant for understanding adaptive evolution and behavior.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our proposal, using&nbsp;<em>A. burtoni,&nbsp;</em>has yielded significant findings about the underlying processes governing color change and its behavioral implications. One key discovery is the role of the endothelin receptor B (EdnRB) gene in regulating yellow pigment aggregation. Specifically, when fish are housed in a yellow visual environment, there is increased methylation at its promoter, leading to decreased transcription of the EdnRB gene, which in turn causes yellow coloration to be more prominent. Conversely, in blue environments, the EdnRB gene is overexpressed. This dynamic, reversible epigenetic regulation is a key mechanism driving color changes in response to visual cues. Additionally, we explored the link between color patterns and specific behaviors, revealing how territorial (T) males display more conspicuous colors compared to non-territorial (NT) males, with these color patterns being associated with different actions, such as digging, quivering, and aggressive displays. Moreover, we have also shown that social rank affects not only coloration but also reproductive behaviors, with T males having higher reproductive success and showing similar behaviors to ascending NT males, and more complexity in transitions in novel spawning environments. These findings demonstrate the complex and interconnected nature of color, behavior, and social hierarchy in&nbsp;<em>A. burtoni.</em></p>\r\n<p><br />The broader impacts of this work extend significantly, particularly in its focus on training underrepresented minorities (URM) in STEM and engaging diverse communities. The PI's position at a Hispanic-serving institution in Queens, New York, allows for the direct training of URM students in advanced molecular techniques and bioinformatics. This is further supported by programs like LSAMP (NSF) and URISE (NIH) sites at Queens College. These initiatives not only enhanced the research capacity of these students but also cultivated a supportive community focused on diversity and inclusion in STEM. The PI&rsquo;s work also has a significant international outreach component, with workshops for high school students in Latin America that use the PI's research to teach concepts of molecular biology and epigenetics while also highlighting the contributions of Latin American scientists.
