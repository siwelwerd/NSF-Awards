The IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) is a premier international conference for presenting the research results, problem solutions, and insights on new challenges in dependability and security of computer systems and networks. The 2019 edition of the conference will be organized around a number of thematic areas of emphasis, including emerging areas such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Systems, and Social Media. The conference will provide various opportunities for student submission and participation. These opportunities range from full-length conference and workshop papers to medium-length preliminary contributions considered by the Student Forum to brief descriptions of early stage research in the Fast Abstracts category.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will provide the attendance opportunity to students in U.S. universities, who otherwise might not be able to attend the conference, in particular students from underrepresented groups, undergraduate and graduate students who are attending the conference for the first time, and students who might not have a paper or presentation at the conference. The broader impacts of the project is primarily through the education students will receive from attending the technical sessions of DSN, mentoring that they will receive through the Student Forum activities, and networking opportunities they will receive through numerous different conference activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We also attracted matching funds from IEEE and IFIP to support travel grants for seven additional students from U.S. universities and 13 international students. To increase the diversity in student participation at the conference, we reached out to the under-represented student groups and selected the awardees by giving more priority to female and undergraduate students, students attending the conference for the first time, and those who did not have a paper at the conference research track or workshop sessions. Out of the 20 U.S. students who received NSF travel awards, 25% were from groups that have traditionally been underrepresented at the conference, and 55% attended the conference for the first time or did not have a paper at the conference. The anonymous feedback collected from the travel grant awardees indicated that the travel grants increased their chance of attendance and participation in the conference. Almost all the awardees indicated that the participation in the conference provided them with opportunities for networking with other researchers in the field, and they got inspiration for new research ideas and topics. They also established new research collaborations, received career mentorship, and in some cases, found career opportunities with academia or industry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/12/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Homa&nbsp;Alemzadeh</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
