 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to identify, explore, render rigorous, and validate one piece of the solution to the puzzle \"how does the brain work?\" - one of the truly fundamental and most challenging frontiers in all of science. Computation in the brain will be approached at an intermediate level of scale, far larger than that of individual neurons and synapses yet significantly smaller than that of the whole brain. The core hypothesis is that \"assemblies,\" large and highly interconnected sets of neurons, are the engine of brain computation. Studying computation at this level is crucial for understanding higher cognitive functions, especially in humans, such as reasoning, planning, and language; and this formulation of brain computation is particularly amenable to the methodology and point of view of the theory of computation, and will further its reach. This project is quintessentially interdisciplinary, and will provide multi-faceted training to graduate and undergraduate students in Computer Science Theory, Machine Learning, and Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychology. It will develop interdisciplinary graduate courses in this particular scientific interface. The results of the project will be disseminated broadly via conferences and journals in all these disciplines, but also in colloquia and public lectures, while students of a great variety of backgrounds will participate in a cutting-edge research experience.\r\n \r\nAssemblies can be the basis of a powerful computational system involving a repertoire of operations including project, associate, and merge. These operations can be shown, through theorems and simulations, to be plausible (that is, they can be \"compiled down\" to the level of neurons and synapses) and useful (in the sense that they can help explain extant experimental results). The project will pursue this assembly hypothesis through: (1) expanding our modeling and our mathematical techniques of analysis for the study of assembly computation; (2) developing more accurate and efficient simulation methodology; (3) embarking on a multi-pronged exploration of the computational power of assemblies in novel modalities beyond formal computation, in particular (a) probabilistic and dynamical systems-like computation through pattern completion and (b) learning and prediction; (4) mathematical modeling and algorithmic investigation of the ways in which the dynamics and biases of synaptic connectivity, as well as assembly overlap, affect the various modes of brain computation; and, importantly, (5) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, and the analysis of the results of these experiments and extant electrocorticography (ECoG) data through novel algorithmic and machine learning techniques for the purpose of identifying evidence of assembly computation in the human brain.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
