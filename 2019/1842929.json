 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop the first low-cost and integrated onboard charger and auxiliary power module for electric vehicles, facilitating deployment of next-generation electrified transportation systems. It is noteworthy that there are more than 250 million registered passenger vehicles in the U.S. Over 40% of greenhouse gases and 70% of emissions come from the transportation sector, and transportation is 99% dependent on one source of fuel: petroleum. Mainstream adoption of electric vehicles is essential if the U.S. is to gain energy security and substantially reduce carbon emissions. The electric car industry has passed its tipping point; however, electric vehicles are still in the very early stages of development. Like early computers, the pieces that make up an electric car are large, heavy, costly and unable to efficiently communicate amongst themselves. The proposed technology not only reduces the volume, cost, and weight of onboard chargers for electric vehicles, but also enhances their efficiencies, and enables bidirectional operation to support future Smart Grid functionalities. This project will lead to creating jobs once the technology matures toward commercialization.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to design and development of an innovative integrated and bidirectional onboard charger for electric vehicles. Currently, all the upcoming and commercially available electric vehicles are equipped with an individual onboard charger to charge traction batteries and an additional auxiliary power module to power auxiliary loads. These converters are heavy, bulky, costly and need to communicate over a variety of controller area networks. The intellectual merit of this project is in the innovative topology, design, control, development, packaging, and validation of the first charger which integrates an onboard charger and an auxiliary power module. This SBIR Phase I project involves the design of the converter, investigation and design of the controller, design and implementation of the electromagnetic interference filter stage, creating the schematics and layout, thermal management, reliability analyses, enclosure design, and final alpha prototype assembly and verification. This important work will (1) lead to theoretical advancements in the design, control, and integration of power electronic converters, (2) involve interdisciplinary research in power electronics, control, packaging, and thermal management, and (3) lead to commercialization of the first integrated onboard charger and auxiliary power module for electric vehicles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
