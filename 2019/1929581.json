Grown from efforts to develop creativity in computing, this biennial meeting integrates the arts and sciences to create compelling learning for students and engage people in developing an inclusive, inter- and trans-disciplinary STEM culture. The proposed initiative makes use of an established community to further the understanding and innovation that Arts and STEM integration can foster in broadening participation and workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
