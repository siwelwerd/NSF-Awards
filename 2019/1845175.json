 "awd_abstract_narration": "Weather instability is predicted to be on the rise and it threatens crop yields. Specifically, out-of-season frosts damage crops costing billions of dollars annually, and restricting growing seasons to avoid potential frosts likely costs in the tens of billions. Also important, the global population is expected to rise and the need to grow more crops on the same land is immediate. Poor understanding of freezing tolerance mechanisms constrains development of more tolerant crops. This project will ultimately provide new knowledge that can guide strategies to engineer freezing tolerance in crop plants. An enzyme named \"Sensitive to Freezing 2\" (SFR2) is known to help plants survive freezing by changing the building blocks of chloroplast membranes. Although SFR2's action is known, the way that SFR2 is activated to respond to freezing conditions and the way that its actions provide an advantage are only hypothesized. This project tests the hypotheses using a unique blend of genetics, biochemistry, and biophysical approaches. It is expected that the results will immediately enhance efforts to generate cold-tolerant crops and will also impact research on membrane temperature stability in other species and engineering systems. Throughout the project, training of Nebraskan post-doctoral researchers and graduate students in plant science will be improved to include public communication and other convergent skillsets. In doing so, members of the general public in Nebraska will also benefit.\r\n\r\nAn enzyme known as Sensitive to Freezing 2 (SFR2) remodels the chloroplast envelope membranes by reducing monogalactolipids and increasing oligogalactolipids. Plants expressing catalytically inactive point mutants of SFR2 are more susceptible to freezing than wildtype plants. Recent evidence from the investigator's lab indicates that SFR2 is activated during freezing by cytoplasmic acidification. Acidification of the cytoplasm also occurs during other stresses in which SFR2 is not active. This and other data suggest that SFR2 activity is tied to a more global cellular response to freezing temperatures in which it directly stabilizes the chloroplast envelope membranes by altering their physical properties. This project will test this hypothesis through the following objectives: (1) Define how membrane stability is affected by SFR2-dependent changes to lipids. (2) Determine if SFR2 activity is repressed by post-translational modification. (3) Define the diversity of chloroplast envelope membrane freezing stabilization mechanisms. These objectives identify mechanisms allowing membrane integrity during freezing temperatures and define how they work (Obj. 1, Obj. 3), and they define a critical cellular freezing signal (Obj. 2). Finally, they will also provide a comprehensive understanding of chloroplast envelope stabilization mechanisms useful in multiple fields. The following training and science literacy objectives are integrated with the above research: (4) Provide comprehensive training for next-generation scientists to be effective researchers and communicators. (5) Educate and engage the public on the societal impact of plant science with innovative graphic novels and interactive presentations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This resilience isn't science fiction, but a potential future currently locked away by our inability to understand how plants adapt their cellular armor, the membranes, to survive the brutal bite of winter. New research, including a series of publications funded by this project (Barnes et al. 2016, Barnes et al. 2023, Barnes et al. 2019, Surber et al. 2024, Shomo et al. 2024), are shedding light on this remarkable process.</p>\n<p>These membranes, akin to a microscopic winter coat, are vital for a plant's well-being. They act as gatekeepers, regulating the flow of nutrients and information within the cell. But as temperatures plummet, these membranes stiffen, threatening their integrity and the very life of the plant.</p>\n<p>Enter SFR2, a fascinating protein that acts like a molecular tailor. It meticulously modifies the composition of the chloroplast membranes, ensuring they remain flexible and functional even in the harshest conditions. It&rsquo;s unique because it is one of the few proteins we know that responds not only to cold but to the severity of the cold. Our research suggests SFR2's ability to sense and respond to cold stress might be an ancient defense mechanism, repurposed from a more general cellular damage response system.</p>\n<p>While changes in cellular acidity can activate SFR2, this appears to be a more recent adaptation. The real secret to its cold-sensing prowess lies in a sophisticated system of chemical tags. These tags, attached and removed by specific enzymes, fine-tune SFR2's activity based on the severity of the cold.</p>\n<p>This intricate dance between SFR2, chemical tags, and temperature unveils a remarkable level of adaptability in plants. By understanding this process, we can unlock the potential to manipulate SFR2, potentially creating crops that can withstand even the most frigid winters.</p>\n<p>The implications are far-reaching. Imagine a future where food security is no longer threatened by seasonal chills. By mimicking or enhancing SFR2's activity, we could ensure a more stable food supply in a world facing a changing climate. This research is a crucial step towards that future, a testament to the ingenuity of nature and the potential of science to unlock its secrets for a more sustainable tomorrow.</p>\n<p><strong>CROPS: Cultivating the Next Generation of Plant Scientists</strong></p>\n<p>Beyond groundbreaking research on plant cold tolerance, this project aimed to foster the next generation of scientific minds. In this spirit, we founded the Collective Research Organization of Plant Scientists (CROPS), a self-directed group of post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, and staff scientists at our university. CROPS empowers early-career researchers by honing their communication and professional development skills through a multifaceted approach. They host workshops on soft skills and careers. They build community by organizing social events, providing a forum for early-career-invited speakers with more interaction with their groups, and funding travel to scientific meetings. They engage the public, raise awareness of plant science, and fund their group through multiple annual outreach events with associated plant sales. CROPS exemplifies the power of self-directed initiatives. Guidance and access to university resources enabled by the PI support CROPS' independent efforts, allowing them to be as broad as plant scientists at our university and beyond.</p>\n<p><strong>Comics as a Key to Public Connection with Science</strong></p>\n<p>Making informed decisions about complex scientific issues like genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be challenging, especially when information comes from sources with low public trust, such as media outlets or government agencies. While scientists are generally more trusted, they often lack the time for meaningful public engagement.</p>\n<p>To bridge this gap, this project explored the power of storytelling through graphic novels. We created two comics addressing biotechnology from relatable perspectives. \"The Changing Times\" follows a Nebraska farm family grappling with the decision to adopt GMO seeds, highlighting the tension between tradition and innovation in a family context. \"The Changing Times: The Green Menace\" follows a young Latina girl on a school trip to an orange grove, focusing on the positive applications of science in agriculture, such as drones and biotechnology.</p>\n<p>Both comics were presented to target audiences, and early results are promising. Audience testing suggests the comics effectively conveyed factual information about GMOs and positively influenced attitudes. This research indicates that educational institutions and scientists can use graphic novels to improve public understanding of complex scientific issues.
