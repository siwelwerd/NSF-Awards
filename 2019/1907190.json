 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The rainforest canopy remains one of the most diverse yet understudied areas of earth's biology. Epiphytes, such as orchids, ferns, and mosses, live in the canopy. These aerial plants are highly diverse, contribute to important ecosystem processes, and provide vital resources for animals. Epiphytes, however, are being threatened by logging and the effects of a changing climate across the world. This research, therefore, also has implications for conservation. The project aims to understand how epiphytes assemble, change over time, and maintain a diverse and healthy community. Epiphytes will be analyzed in the canopies of forests in the Pacific Northwest and Panama. The Fellow will continue work promoting a more inclusive scientific community by teaching, mentoring, and leadership in Spanish and English. \r\n\r\nThe Fellow's research will directly contribute to the longstanding theoretical debate between colonization versus niche processes as drivers of plant community assembly. If niche processes are the primary driver of community assembly, epiphytes will be sorted by host species (the Host Tree Species Specificity Hypothesis), by height strata (the Vertical Niche Stratification Hypothesis), and by orientation to the ground. Alternatively, if colonization processes are the primary mediator of epiphyte assembly, propagule availability will be a better predictor of subsequent diversity than microhabitat (the Dispersal Limitation Hypothesis). To test these hypotheses, the Fellow will establish 540 epiphyte-free permanent sampling plots throughout the profile of 30 epiphyte-laden focal trees in both temperate and tropical rainforests, experimentally manipulating substrate height and orientation. Each year, the Fellow will survey all plots to quantify changes in the diversity and composition of the re-establishing epiphyte communities. The work involves collaboration internationally and with the New York Botanical Garden, which will contribute to training in taxonomy, DNA sequencing and provide a new ecosystem. The Fellow will promote diversity in academia via three major aims: 1) Bridging communication for increased Latinx participation; 2) Mentoring undergraduates via hands-on research; and 3) Extending international experiences to underrepresented groups via independent study projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These plants are important resources for animals and ecosystem processes, make up about 10% of global vascular plant species, and are at particularly vulnerable to climatic changes due to their dependence on high moisture conditions. However, because they grow up in the canopy, epiphytic plants are much less well-studied than terrestrial ground-rooted plants. This project involved two field experiments across very different ecosystems: one in a tropical cloud forest in central Panama and one in a temperate rain forest in Washington State. Both ecosystems have abundant epiphytes. Although the field work in Panama was delayed for two years due to the pandemic, the project resulted in several meaningful publications and progress in understanding how epiphytes respond to disturbance, change over time, and what contributes to their mortality. For example, a review paper written during the first year of the fellowship (Spicer &amp; Woods 2022, <em>Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics</em>) synthesized the literature on epiphyte biotic interactions, highlighting the need for more information on the relationships between epiphytes and other epiphytes and between epiphytes and microbes. Another review paper highlighted the importance of herbaceous plants for biodiversity in forested ecosystems (Spicer <em>et al.</em> 2022, <em>Plant Ecology</em>). Two additional papers from early data from the Panama field site were also published: one that suggested substrate texture and removal processes as potential contributors to high mortality at very early stages of life (Spicer <em>et al.</em> 2022, <em>Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society</em>), and one that showed that being in contact with the ground soil itself is detrimental to epiphytes (Spicer &amp; Ortega 2023, <em>Journal of Ecology</em>). Field data collected later in the fellowship are still in preparation for dissemination, and preliminary results have been presented at various scientific conferences and invited seminars. A bilingual field guide to common epiphytes of the tropical field site is also in development.</p>\n<p><em>Broader impacts</em></p>\n<p>In addition to the scientific outcomes of this project, the fellow was also involved with several initiatives to advance participation of historically excluded groups in STEM fields. A new upper-level interdisciplinary undergraduate course, <em>Sustainability in Latin America, </em>was developed and improved throughout the NSF-supported postdoctoral fellowship, and will be offered in the future at the fellow&rsquo;s home institution. The course was run virtually at the University of Pittsburgh, and attracted a variety of students from Latin American Studies and STEM fields. The fellow also mentored seven undergraduate students (three from the University of Puget Sound, two from the Universidad de Panama-Ciudad de Panama, one from the Universidad de Panama-Santiago, and one from Yale University), one recent undergraduate (Gonzaga University), and one Masters student (Yale University). The fellow also led several events and served on committees promoting racial justice and LGBTQ+ community-building throughout the fellowship.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/01/2024<br>\nModified by:
