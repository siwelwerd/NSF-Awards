 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Isiah Warner, Jin-Woo Choi, and Kevin McCarter and their groups at Louisiana State University are using liquid and solid organic salts as the basis for new kinds of chemical sensors for important and biomedically relevant analytes. These solid phase salts are being formulated as nanomaterials to enable additional analytical applications. The probe involves coupling the salts with a \"quartz crystal microbalance\" (QCM) - an instrument normally used for simply weighing minute amounts of materials, but in this case providing selective sensing based on the selective interactions of the salts with target analytes. Miniature versions of this novel instrumentation are being developed to enable use as portable sensors for analyses of volatile analytes.  The work exposes a diverse group of students to state-of-the-art research in chemical instrumentation through research opportunities and extensive public outreach.\r\n\r\nThese studies focus on ionic liquids and solid-state materials derived from a \"Group of Uniform Materials Based on Organic Salts\" (GUMBOS), including nanomaterials derived from GUMBOS (nanoGUMBOS). The nanoGUMBOS can be safe and effective alternatives relative to many current nanomaterials used for bioanalytical applications. The work targets novel, useful, and environmentally friendly analytical applications. For example, strategies are being developed for selective measurement of analytically important biomedical targets through novel solvent and solid phase extractions. In combination with the QCM, the GUMBOs can serve in sensors using multiple analytical strategies. Novel QCM micro-instrumentation is being developed to enhance the range of analytical applications for this methodology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
