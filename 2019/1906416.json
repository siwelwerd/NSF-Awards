 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The gut microbiome is the community of bacteria that lives in an animal's gastrointestinal tracts. The microbiome helps shape the lives of their hosts across days, seasons, lifetimes, and generations. Captive wildlife, like those housed at zoos or research facilities, provide the opportunity to explore how the gut microbiome is controlled; however, compared to laboratory models, they remain untapped resources. The Biological Collections at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC), including a living primate colony and a tissue bank, are well suited to microbiome research. The fellow will use these biological collections to test how diet, and the specific consumption of foliage, shape the gut microbiome across leaf eaters, fruit eaters, and omnivores in primates. Ultimately, the value of this project is twofold: (1) It will create knowledge about what controls the gut microbiome in primates, with potential applied value to human healthcare and wildlife conservation; and (2) Through diverse sponsorship, the project will stimulate dialogue across scientific disciplines and will lead to the development of resources for the research community.\r\n\r\nThe project will use Biological Collections to test the hypothesis that, compared to other feeding strategies, folivory more strongly drives host-microbiome coadaptation. In three studies, the fellow will probe how foliage consumption differentially drives gut-microbiome dynamics across folivorous, omnivorous, and frugivorous lemurs. Whereas the first study uses banked samples to compare microbiota along the species' gastrointestinal tracts, the second and third studies use the living colony, with study two asking how free-choice foraging shapes feeding and microbial ecology across seasonal scales, and study three using dietary manipulations to determine how cellulose and tannins regulate communities across daily scales. In addition to standard microbiome methods, during training residencies with sponsors Clayton and Eley, the fellow will develop metrics of dietary reconstruction from fecal samples via chloroplast sequencing, isotopic and wax-alkane analysis, and of microbiome dynamics via anaerobic and experimental culturing. The project is expected to yield research and review-style publications, and methodological descriptions. The fellow will mentor undergraduates throughout and work with the Duke Lemur Center's Education and Communication departments to create new materials for school children, the general public, and the social-media audience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This postdoctoral fellowship used lemurs, diverse primates from Madagascar, to ask how gut microbiome features are driven by differences in diet and feeding strategy, and how such links relate to host health and nutrition. Whereas diet describes the foods consumed by an individual across days and seasons, feeding strategy describes the foods a species evolved to eat. Lemurs naturally show a wide range of feeding strategies, from obligate frugivory to obligate folivory, as well as strong variation in diets because food availability in Madagascar is seasonal and stochastic.</p>\n<p>Using the natural diversity and flexibility of lemurs, this fellowship focused on a collection of living lemurs at the Duke Lemur Center, and a historical bank of samples collected at the end of the animals' lives. In a series of integrated projects, PI Greene compared the gut microbiome of diverse lemurs at different gastrointestinal sites; experimentally boosted fiber intake in frugivorous, omnivorous, and folivorous lemurs and measured downstream changes to gut consortia; probed links between foraging behavior, plant nutrition, the gut microbiome, and lemur energetics, metabolism, and health in omnivores and folivores housed in forest enclosures; and learned molecular and geochemical techniques to assay plants from fecal samples to determine the utility of dietary reconstruction from feces for population and conservation monitoring of wildlife.</p>\n<p>One result of this fellowship highlights the clear role of gut morphology, and particularly the length and complexity of the large intestine, in shaping the primate gut microbiome. Differently structured guts establish different environmental conditions, such as oxygen levels and acidity, which constrain the types of inhabiting microbes. This constraint explains why swapping the diets of a frugivore and a folivore will not swap their gut microbiomes: Rather, such feeding experiments shift the gut microbiome in species-specific ways. Thus, this fellowship helped clarify that feeding strategy, linked to gut morphology over evolutionary history, predominately shapes the microbiome across distant relatives. However, within closely related species that share similar gut morphologies, diet, location, and sociality can further shape microbiome features.</p>\n<p>Another result of this fellowship stems from an aim developed during the life of the award. Because of the pandemic, Greene maximized data collection on lemurs in large forest enclosures (to minimize shared air) and was granted a third-year extension to add new components. As a result, Greene gained insight into how lemurs- bred for generations in captivity- behave under naturalistic conditions, show variation in foraging and ranging behavior in non-native ecosystems, and how this behavior shapes health. What is clear is that captive primates, when housed under ecologically relevant conditions, show behaviors that reflect those of their wild kin, including home range size, travel distances, foraging rates, and the selection of plant parts and nutrient profiles. Within lemur species, foraging behavior correlates to changes in the gut microbiome, and to key markers of host nutrition and energy expenditure, like circulating amino acids and thyroid hormones. Ultimately, this body of research calls for greater consideration of species' ecologies in the management of wildlife under human care.</p>\n<p>Results of the additional project components are still underdoing analysis, with scientific articles intended for publication in 2023. The Duke Lemur Center has extended PI Greene's postdoctoral appointment to enable her continued work on this project.</p>\n<p>PI Greene engaged in broader impact activities designed to spur science participation in American (and international) students and science understanding in the American public. First, Greene launched a collaboration with the miniPCR Bio company. Together, they designed and produced a lemur Learning Lab on Conservation Genetics for high-school STEM classrooms. The lab provides hands-on experience with molecular genetics and data analyses to determine the number of dwarf lemur species in a forest and assess their conservation status. To date, the lab has been used by thousands of students in hundreds of classrooms across the US. Second, Greene created a professional social media profile on Instagram (@lemurscientist), where she posts regular content about lemurs and Madagascar, and answers questions about STEM careers and LGBTQ issues in science. The account has gained &gt;9k followers and currently reaches ~50k users monthly. Through Instagram, Greene engages with science teachers, early career researchers, and curious members of the public. Lastly, Greene mentored or co-mentored 25 early career scientists on independent projects. These mentees variably hailed from private, public, and community college, most were women, and many came from historically excluded groups (e.g., non-white, LGBTG+, 1G). Several mentees are currently applying to graduate school and others writing their first scientific articles for publication.</p>\n<p>On a final note, PI Greene would like to thank NSF for the fellowship extension that provided swift and significant support during the worst of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/05/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lydia&nbsp;K&nbsp;Greene</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906416/1906416_10607708_1670249198378_7A05F57B-4E60-45E2-9903-8DF4A8E1A1103--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906416/1906416_10607708_1670249198378_7A05F57B-4E60-45E2-9903-8DF4A8E1A1103--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Data collection\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906416/1906416_10607708_1670249198378_7A05F57B-4E60-45E2-9903-8DF4A8E1A1103--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Data collection\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PI Greene observes the foraging behavior of Beatrice, a Coquerel's sifaka, in the 6th forest enclosure at the Duke Lemur Center.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lydia Greene</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lydia&nbsp;K&nbsp;Greene</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Data collection</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906416/1906416_10607708_1670249282057_2049088E-492F-4F78-BD94-5D41756D89782--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906416/1906416_10607708_1670249282057_2049088E-492F-4F78-BD94-5D41756D89782--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Coquerel's sifaka\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906416/1906416_10607708_1670249282057_2049088E-492F-4F78-BD94-5D41756D89782--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Coquerel's sifaka\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Eustace, a Coquerel's sifaka, forages for young blackberry leaves in the 4th forest enclosure at the Duke Lemur Center.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lydia Greeme</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lydia&nbsp;K&nbsp;Greene</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Coquerel's sifaka</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906416/1906416_10607708_1670249363253_790A73F9-9169-461B-BF64-E03C3FE99BDC4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906416/1906416_10607708_1670249363253_790A73F9-9169-461B-BF64-E03C3FE99BDC4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ring-tailed lemur\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906416/1906416_10607708_1670249363253_790A73F9-9169-461B-BF64-E03C3FE99BDC4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ring-tailed lemur\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Brigitta, a ring-tailed lemur, forages for fresh pinecone scales in the 5th forest enclosure at the Duke Lemur Center.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lydia Greene</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lydia&nbsp;K&nbsp;Greene</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ring-tailed lemur</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906416/1906416_10607708_1670249626753_IMG_4177--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906416/1906416_10607708_1670249626753_IMG_4177--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Presentation at AGU\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906416/1906416_10607708_1670249626753_IMG_4177--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Presentation at AGU\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PI Greene presents her eLightning talk at the AGU conference.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lydia Greene</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lydia&nbsp;K&nbsp;Greene</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Presentation at AGU</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
