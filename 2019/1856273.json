 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is jointly funded by the Chemical Synthesis program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research to support the research of Professor Jimmy Wu of Dartmouth College.  Dr. Wu is developing new chemical synthesis of organic compounds with unique chemical structures. This research is leading to the discovery of molecules with important physical and/or biological properties. To accomplish these goals, Prof. Wu invents new reactions that can be applied to the synthesis of a class of anti-diabetic compounds that are found in the seeds of the Akuamma trees which grow in western Africa. In collaboration with Professor Lori Loeb of the Department of Computer Science at Dartmouth, Professor Wu is also producing a series of short, animated films focused on important concepts in organic chemistry and other STEM topics. The target audience is middle school, high school, and college students, as well as the general public. The fourth animation in this series is currently in production and tells the story of exenatide, an FDA-approved drug for type 2 diabetes that was first discovered in the saliva of the Gila monster.  \r\n\r\nProfessor Wu is actively pursuing advances in heterocyclic chemistry within the context of the total synthesis of complex natural products from the akuamma family of indoline alkaloids. His strategy makes use of reactions recently developed in his research group as key steps in the synthesis. These reactions include the dearomative indole 3+2 annulation reaction and nucleophile-intercepted Beckmann fragmentation, among others. At least one member of these compounds possesses anti-diabetic properties and is thought to work by dual inhibition of the sodium/glucose co-transporters SGLT1 and SGLT2.  Additionally, Professor Wu is using fundamental knowledge gleaned from these syntheses as the basis for preparing complex heterocyclic scaffolds that populate novel chemical space. The broader scientific impacts of this award are multi-fold, with the most obvious being advances in understanding both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In addition, benefits arise from the use of these newly invented reactions by others in the chemical community in synthetic endeavors unrelated to the akuammilines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNatural product molecules that contain the indoline heterocycle are ubiquitous in nature and often exhibit interesting and/or novel biological properties.  However, access to these compounds, and hence the ability to study them more deeply, is often hindered by the lack of availability to sufficient quantities of the molecules.  In this funding period, we have developed new chemical methods for preparing indoline-containing compounds that can be used in the total synthesis of the akuammiline family of indoline natural products.  In particular, we identified an efficient synthetic route towards a key intermediate of one member of these alkaloids that exhibit anti-diabetic properties.  We have also discovered a new to append six-membered carbocyclic rings onto indolines in a regiodivergent fashion (either head-to-tail or head-to-head).  The ability to \"dial-in\" a desired regiochemical outcome in ring-forming reactions is rare and is therefore a significant achievement.  Some of the compounds that can be made using this new technology contain adjacent and stereodefined quaternary carbon centers.  This is an architectural motif that is often found in natural products but is extremely difficult to synthesize in the laboratory due to the highly sterically congested environment.  Finally, we discovered a method for using silver salts to diversify products that are obtained from the nucleophile-intercepted Beckmann fragmentation (NuBFr), another reaction that was also developed in our research group.  The ability to replace a halogen atom with various nitrogen- and oxygen-containing functional groups greatly increases the range of compounds that can be accessed using our proprietary methodology.  Computational studies carried out with assistance from our collaborators provided valuable insight into the mechanism of this important transformation.\n\nAs part of our ongoing outreach program, we collaborated with Prof. Lorie Loeb (Dartmouth Computer Science Department and Digital Arts Program) and a Dartmouth undergraduate student to create a short-animated film about the importance of natural products to human health.  This is the 4th cartoon to be created by our group.  It tells the story of exendin-4, a molecule that was isolated from the saliva of the Gila monster and is being used as a drug to treat type-2 diabetes.  This film was published on YouTube and on the Wu research group website.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/17/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jimmy Wu"
