 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase II project will create a material, printer, and software system for printing a novel set of flexible, durable materials for additive manufacturing technologies. Additive manufacturing, or 3D Printing, is a rapidly growing $7bn industry, which enables small and medium enterprises to competitively manufacture new and innovative products. It is a key to strengthening the US manufacturing economy. Continued growth and health of the 3D printing industry, particularly for manufacture of functional parts for finished goods, will depend upon an expansion of the available material library. 3D printing materials are limited to a small segment of the plastics in common industrial use today. This project will expand that material library with development of printable polyurethane elastomers with a broad range of flexibilities. These materials will be particularly relevant for markets that demand personalization and customization, such as patient-specific medical devices, sporting goods, and footwear. Manufacturers of flexible, durable polyurethane goods for industrial and automotive products will also benefit from low cost small-scale production of parts made from materials with performance that match their product specifications. The printing system will enable production of parts with user-specified geometry and flexibility, and will also enable multi-material printing for novel product designs. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase II project will produce a set of reactive polyurethane precursor formulas which can be combined to form printable, flexible polyurethanes with a broad hardness range. The Phase II project will also produce an integrated system of printer control software and printhead design for production of parts with the polyurethane precursor formulas. The materials will be printed using extrusion 3D printing techniques, and customized to handle liquid, reactive feeds. The research approach will include determination of the starting materials to control reaction rates, rheology development, and part solidification. Software development will incorporate printing parameters for the spectrum of materials that can be produced from the starting materials in order to produce a user interface where part flexibility is specified as a function of part geometry, and the printer receives commands for printing the desired object.  The material  will be parameterized to determine space-filling properties of the material as a function of composition, print speed, and printhead geometry.  This 3D printing technology will overcome challenges in part durability and printing speeds that are common to photo-cure approaches to produce flexible parts, and will greatly extend the part durability and flexibility available to extrusion 3D printing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject 1853265: Novel Dynamic Elastomer System for Additive Manufacturing\n\nProject Outcome Report\n\n \n\n3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is a processing technique that permits low-cost production of custom parts. It also permits part designs that have not been accessible with conventional manufacturing techniques.  The technology is considered to be disruptive to the manufacturing industry.  However, 3D printed parts are notoriously fragile, and has limited the addressable 3D printing market to prototyping.  Development of materials and 3D printing techniques to produce durable parts is considered to be critical for the advancement of 3D printing into the manufacturing sector.\n\nThe primary research objectives were as follows:\n\nPrintable material compositions with material strength and elasticity that is comparable to commercial polyurethane resins \nAbility to print with blends of materials and have the appropriate print parameters\nPrinter control software that generates printer instructions for the multi-material printing system\nDevelop a support material, and integrate into software system\n\n\nThe result of our research is the development of a 3D printing system (material, printer, and software) that permits 3D printing of industrial-strength flexible parts across a range of hardnesses.  Today, we are using this 3D printing system for production of elastomeric parts across a range of demanding industries, including rail, defense, classic cars, underwater air containment, and apparel.  At comparable flexibility levels, we have demonstrated toughness at twice the level of the next nearest competitor (Carbon3D).  Furthermore, we have demonstrated a 3D printing system capable of printing best-in-class thickness, part size, and hybrid-manufacturing capability without part warpage at outstanding printing speeds.  Lastly, we developed a support material system using recyclable FDM plastics, which improves the overall sustainability of 3D printing methods.\n\nThe entire printing system permits part development with fewer than five iterations.  Part production is in the range of 200-500 g/hour, making the overall system cost competitive with industrial part production for small-lot runs (1000 parts or fewer).\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cora M Leibig"
