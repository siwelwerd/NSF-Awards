 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will provide a next-generation commercial method of removing volatile organic contaminants (VOCs) such as benzene, formaldehyde and methylene chloride from indoor air.  These compounds are potential carcinogens and also exacerbate allergies, asthma, and other respiratory problems.  Indoor air quality is generally 5 times worse than outdoor air quality, and VOCs are prevalent indoors because they are emitted from carpets, adhesives, plastic products, typical household chemical cleaners and electronics. Children are especially sensitive to VOCs, and indoor environments pose greater health risks because of the time spent indoors. Alleviating the daily discomfort and financial burdens, estimated at around $50 billion annually in the U.S., posed by environmental air pollutants such as VOCs can significantly improve human health and comfort.  The development and commercial deployment of this new technology will also provide enhanced scientific understanding of manufacturing for nanotechnologies. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on validating the ability of a biosilica-based photocatalyst to actively and continuously improve indoor air quality by reducing total VOCs found in indoor environments when the photocatalyst is added to floor and carpet coatings. VOCs are emitted as gases from certain solids and liquids, and they include chemicals potentially causing short- and long-term adverse health effects--especially indoors, where concentrations may be up to ten times higher than outdoors. This project will test the performance of this unique additive when applied to floor and carpet coating systems to reduce total VOCs and will validate manufacturing processes to achieve scale-up quantities needed for commercial production. The technology works by first adsorbing VOCs and then degrading them to CO2 and H2O. Coated surfaces in test chambers simulating a typical indoor environment will be evaluated via continuous monitoring of airborne pollutants. It is anticipated that the ultimate deliverables of this project would include validation of a VOC-degrading additive for multiple products and advanced knowledge of nano-manufacturing processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
