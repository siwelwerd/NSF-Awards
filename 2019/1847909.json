 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dense stars cause some of the most powerful explosions in the Universe.  For example, white dwarf stars explode at the end of their lives as Supernovae, when they ignite a runaway nuclear reaction.  These explosions can be seen at great distances and are important for measuring the expansion of the Universe.   These hot explosions expel ionized iron, nickel and other metals into space, leaving behind dense neutron stars.  Neutron stars can also explode by merger of two neutron stars. This explosion is very different, and creates very heavy elements, like gold and barium.  Neutron star mergers have recently been discovered with the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). The investigator will estimate the rate of neutron star mergers by sensitive observations of the amounts of barium, iron and other metals in nearby galaxies.  The investigator's goal is to understand which types of explosions have created the elements found on Earth and throughout the Universe.\r\n\r\nHigh school students will participate in this research during the summer. The investigator will encourage the inclusion of new groups of students by offering stipends.  The investigator also plans to implement tiers of mentoring.  Faculty will mentor postdocs, who will mentor graduate students.  The graduate students will mentor undergraduate students, who will mentor high school students.  This strategy has been shown to encourage younger students to pursue research careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
