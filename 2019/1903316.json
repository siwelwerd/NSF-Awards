 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research project is on the physics of generating very uniform plasmas for future particle accelerator applications. Plasmas, the fourth state of matter, are of importance for many science and industrial applications, one of which is as a medium for next generation particle accelerators. The electrical features of a plasma allow for high accelerating electric field gradients which are up to a factor of a hundred greater than in existing solid-state-based particle accelerators.  This can translate into much more compact, energetic, and cheap accelerators. At CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, the AWAKE project aims to use a plasma column as a medium for a next generation electron accelerator based on the wakefield acceleration concept.  This grant will support research aimed at improving the understanding of how a plasma column can be formed and tuned for the requirements in the AWAKE accelerator application. The understanding of such plasma sources is also of direct relevance to a variety of other applications, such as plasma processing in industry and life-sciences, plasma generation for fusion-based neutron sources, and development of a wind-tunnel experiment for astrophysical plasma turbulence.\r\n\r\nThe specific method used for plasma generation in this project is the so-called Helicon wave. These are radio-frequency waves in the whistler regime, known broadly for reliable generation of magnetized plasmas at high density with very high ionization fractions. In the magnetic field regimes of 10^3 Gauss, these waves are canonically called Helicons. They are characterized by a transition from an inductively coupled, low density and low ionization regime into a regime of high density and almost complete gas ionization. This transition into the helicon regime and the ionization dynamics in this regime are not yet fully understood. This is linked to the application of a plasma as the medium for particle acceleration. This application requires unprecedented levels of homogeneity in the plasma density in the direction of the accelerated particle beam path. The goal of this research is to resolve the helicon transition and understand the ionization dynamics during the transition and shortly afterwards. Plasma diagnostics based on analyzing the light emitted from the plasma will be used to understand the plasma axial homogeneity and methods of active, local gas injection will be used to gain control of the axial plasma density.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To do so, a specific device, the Madison AWAKE Prototype (MAP), was constructed and is operational as a workhorse for fundamental helicon questions. Figure 1 shows an overview of the device. The device was outfitted with a comprehensive Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) system, to acquire data for a full particle balance. A new microwave system was established to serve as absolute density reference for the LIF system and a comprehensive full-wave COMSOL based model was developed to support the device design, experimental layout and the research overall. The first main discovery is the explanation of a strong directionality of plasma generation in a homogenous axial magnetic field for the helicon waves. It was shown that under steep density gradient conditions a plasma response current to the external RF waves applied is expected. The modulating magnetic field, generated by this current, interferes with the external AC currents of the applied RF fields constructively for one antenna handiness while it interferes destructively for the other. This explains the preferential helicon setup that has traditionally been used in the discipline, based on a first principles addition to the wave equation and is supported directly by these experiments at MAP. This result is published in [M. Granetzny et al. Physics of Plasmas (Letter) 30 (2023) 120701] and visualized in figure 2. This allows to select a strongly forward directed plasma directionality and enables to create multi-antenna setups with linearly superimposed plasmas. The density gradient in small diameter cells like MAP is formed by dominant radial particle sourcing through radial outflux in the weekly magnetized ion condition. This was resolved with a directly measured full particle balance, which is the basis for the second main finding of this project (see [M. Zepp et al. Physics of Plasmas (Letter) 31 (2024) 070704]). These direct measurements support that at high-power, axially homogenous plasmas can be formed by stacking antennas and their interaction as shown to be limited to the momentum exchange between neutrals flowing through the vessel and the ions of each antenna with another. A density variability of less than 7% was shown along the axis in density regimes of up to 1.0 x 10<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>-3</sup>. In figure 3 an example of the state of the art for such combined density profiles is shown. These findings on RF coupling and plasma generation open a pathway to long plasma columns in such density regimes, which are of great interest for particle driven wakefield accelerator applications for instance.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Oliver&nbsp;Schmitz</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1903316/1903316_10613459_1730221324895_Outcomes_fig2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1903316/1903316_10613459_1730221324895_Outcomes_fig2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"COMSOL calculated modulated magnetic field\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1903316/1903316_10613459_1730221324895_Outcomes_fig2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"COMSOL calculated modulated magnetic field\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2: Modulated magnetic field density by the applied RF wave and the density gradient for two antenna helicities, inducing opposite directionality for the plasma created by this wave.
