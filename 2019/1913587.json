 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major challenge in hypersonic flight is the presence of large aerodynamic forces and high heating rates that combine to cause dynamic deformation and thermal-induced buckling of aircraft structures. The interaction between a shock wave and the boundary layer can cause high heating, vibrations and structural instabilities such as flutter. These effects can lead to fatigue of thin panel structures with potentially catastrophic implications for a flight vehicle. To address these issues, this project will investigate the flow near a compliant panel under hypersonic conditions.  It will also lead to an educational partnership between University of Texas-Austin and Huston-Tillotson University - small private historically black university.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed work is to investigate the interaction between a thin compliant panel underneath hypersonic separated flows which are generated by single- and double-sharp fins at an angle of attack. Combined kilo Hertz-rate optical diagnostics will be used to make simultaneous measurements of the panel displacement, surface pressures, and near-wall velocity fields. A range of panel thicknesses will be used to vary the vibrational frequencies and amplitudes. An important innovation will be the use a new inverse method to compute the fluctuating pressure field that causes the dynamic deformation. Tailoring the elastic and inertial properties of the panels will enable the investigation of passive control of the separated flow unsteadiness and, thus, potentially reduce the deleterious effects of the separated flow by purposeful design. The educational plan will focus on a robust effort to engage under-represented minority undergraduate students in the research.\r\n\r\nThe project is co-funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
