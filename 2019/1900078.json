 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrons are one of the basic particles that make up atoms and molecules.  Two key features of an electron are its negative charge and its spin (the electron spins about an axis, like a spinning top). For a long time, scientists have known that an electron's motion through molecules depends on how it's charge is attracted to the positively-charged nuclei and repelled by the other electrons. It was recently discovered that the direction of an electron's spin could alter the ability of an electron to move through a chiral molecule, in a process called spin-filtering. A molecule is chiral when it's mirror images cannot be superimposed on one another; Our right and left hands are examples of chiral objects. The recent finding that the electron's spin can also affect its motion, particularly when interacting with a chiral molecule, opens new possibilities in chemistry.  In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism-A program of the Chemistry Division, Professor David Waldeck of the University of Pittsburgh and his students are using electrical and electrochemical methods to correlate the spin filtering properties of chiral molecules with their molecular structures.  Their discoveries could have important implications for controlling chirality in chemical reactions, which could benefit the development of new pharmaceuticals and the creation of better catalysts for advanced manufacturing. Students working on this project benefit from collaborative and multidisciplinary activities with other scientists in Pittsburgh and Israel. Professor Waldeck is also building a network of middle school and high school science teachers to promote interest and learning in science.\r\n \r\nThe chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect challenges the conventional wisdom about the magnitude of spin-orbit coupling in organic molecules and raises interesting implications for the role of chirality in electron transfer processes. While numerous experiments demonstrate CISS for a range of molecules, the need exists to perform quantitative measurements of the phenomenon and correlate it with other molecular properties. The experimental studies explore the spin-filtering that arises from CISS.  Hall probe measurements are used to quantify the magnetization that arises from films comprising chiral molecules, both with and without chiral secondary structure.  The researchers also measure spin polarization and compare it with intrinsic molecular properties, such as their chiro-optical response and their polarizabilities. Electrochemical measurements are used to quantify the spin filtering in electrochemical charge transfer reactions through chiral molecules and compared it with Hall probe studies on the same molecules. Given that spin can be an important constraint for chemical transformations and many biomolecules are chiral, the CISS effect could have important implications in both chemistry and biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBackground: Many molecules in nature are chiral, which means that the mirror image of a molecule cannot be superimposed on itself, like right and left hands.  This 'handedness' of molecules can have important effects on their function.  In biological organisms many of the biomolecules (like proteins, peptides, DNA, sugars, etc.) are homochiral; i.e., biomolecules of a given type have the same 'handedness'.  Although the reason for this fact is not known, the conventional wisdom states that it arises from how the biomolecules can 'fit' together with their neighbors.\n\nOur project has investigated the new idea that the spin-filtering of electrons by chiral biomolecules can affect their chemical function, which, more generally, provides another reason for why biomolecules might be homochiral. Although most people are familiar with the fact that electron's have a charge, it is not as broadly appreciated that electrons also have a spin.  That is, one can think of electrons as spinning, like a top, around an axis going through the electron. We have studied how the handedness of chiral molecules and the spin direction of the electron (clockwise versus counterclockwise) affects a molecule's properties. Our studies have demonstrated previously unexplored connections between the chirality of peptides and amino acids and their spin-filtering power. New things that we demonstrated are \n\n1) If we apply an electrical voltage on chiral molecules we distort their electron clouds in space and in their spin distributions.  Previous studies by us looked at small peptides which have a helical structure, however in the current studies we have shown that the helical structure is not needed.  One only needs to have a single atom in the molecule that distorts the electron cloud in a chiral way.  Because electron spins are important for chemical bond formation, this observation implies that even small chiral molecules will interact and bind in ways that depend on their electron spin distributions.\n\n2) It is known that chiral molecules can rotate the polarization direction of light; and since the time of Louis Pasteur this phenomenon has been used to study chiral molecules. Our work shows that the electron spin-filtering power of small peptide molecules is correlated with the molecules' ability to rotate the polarization of light.  We hypothesize that this fact can be used to search for molecules with high spin-filtering power and to guide the development fo theoretical models for spin filtering by chiral molecules.\n\n3) Protein molecules are homochiral and many protein molecules undergo reduction and oxidation reactions (called redox proteins).  We studied the redox protein, cytochrome c, in assemblies of peptides that were either homochiral or heterochiral.  For assemblies in which the protein and the peptides have the same handedness (homochiral assemblies) the electron transfer rates are higher than for assemblies in which the protein and the peptides ahve a different handedness (heterochiral assemblies). This finding implies that the efficiency of redox processes in homochiral supramolecular assemblies will be superior to those of heterochiral assemblies and could help explain why biological organisms are homochiral.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/25/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David H Waldeck"
