 "awd_abstract_narration": "Groundwater, a classic common pool resource, is a vital and life-sustaining resource for billions of people worldwide and for many ecosystems. It is crucial during drought when surface water is limited. Yet unsustainable depletion of groundwater is now well documented on regional and national scales, and overdraft is projected to increase under climate change. Although groundwater has been the subject of theorizing about institutional arrangements to govern the management of common pool resources, further work is essential if we are to prevent depletion of this vital natural resource. A critical area of study is how groundwater institutions evolve over time and how this dynamic process can incentivize sustainable resource use and more inclusive management. A comparison of alternative approaches will be valuable in devising management systems in multiple settings where groundwater is an indispensable resource and where there are unsustainable levels of demand. Through the training and mentoring of graduate students, and the use of presentations and publications, it will both advance the integration of research and teaching and enable the broad dissemination of research findings.\r\n \r\nResearch will be conducted in California where groundwater is a major water supply source for human consumption, agriculture and many ecosystems. The state's geographic, physical and social diversity complements the diversity of management institutions in other groundwater-reliant regions. The investigators will employ a new dynamic and comparative approach that links the evolution of resource institutions to resource outcomes. This will be accomplished utilizing an exploration over time of two very different models: Court Adjudication - where the court defines and assigns private rights to groundwater; and legislatively created Special Act Districts (SAD)-with a mandate to provide enhanced local public regulation of groundwater. Both adjudicated basins and SADs are embedded within polycentric systems, interacting with state, federal and local institutions, and while both have been noted as potential approaches to achieve sustainable groundwater management, no research has explicitly examined whether this is the case over time. Research will analyze their different foundations and mandates and closely observe their dynamic development over time. The goals are to understand how they incentivize different management approaches, evolve specific patterns of horizontal and vertical interdependence, and how these interactions over time produce specific resource outcomes. Findings will help to formulate recommendations and guidelines for the future sustainable management of common pool resources in general, and groundwater in particular.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The problem is that unsustainable depletion of groundwater is now well documented globally and overdraft is projected to increase under climate change. Scholars are united in acknowledging that the institutional structures and rules that govern the management of groundwater are critical to sustain the resource. Our project<strong> </strong>evaluated the governance attributes most likely to lead to the sustainable and just use of groundwater.</p>\n<p>Our first outcome was the development of an approach to study the multiple physical and institutional variables likely to result in sustainable resource use. We designed a large-N study and formulated hypotheses regarding those variables likely to affect resource sustainability. We collected data on those variables for selected California groundwater basins managed by three different institutional structures: court supervision after an adjudication of groundwater user?s water rights; local agency management for legislatively created special act districts (SADs); and management by groundwater sustainability agencies (GSAs) created under California?s 2015 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act. The research process involved defining criteria for sustainable outcomes and the formulation of questions and hypotheses. Our goal was to understand the characteristics of groundwater management agencies that are the best predictors of the sustainable use of groundwater, and whether these characteristics differ when the groundwater basin is managed through adjudication, a SAD, or a GSA. Our research team is applying for funding to continue this project component.</p>\n<p>Our second outcome was an in-depth examination of one governance attribute, polycentricity, that is acknowledged as an important variable affecting the functioning and behavior of institutions managing natural resources such as groundwater. An institution displays polycentric characteristics if there are multiple, overlapping decisionmaking centers with some degree of autonomy that choose to act through processes of cooperation, competition and con&#64258;ict resolution. In polycentric systems, each institution is seen as a component in a cross-border and cross-level management system that potentially results in more robust institutional decision-making and more sustainable resource outcomes.</p>\n<p>We used an evolutionary lens to identify the dynamic factors that shape different development trajectories and patterns of institutional interactions, and to illuminate why and how opportunities for cooperation are generated that can affect sustainable resource outcomes. We developed a framework for the evolution of polycentric formation (Figure 1) and used a case study of groundwater institutions in California?s San Gabriel River Watershed to illustrate the framework (Figures 2 &amp; 3).</p>\n<p>First we provided a snapshot of the current system to illustrate its polycentric characteristics. The watershed has five groundwater basins governed by a court appointed Watermaster composed of one or more management entities whose decisions are required to comply with the court judgment. A sixth basin in the Los Angeles River Watershed is also linked to the watershed. (Figure 4)</p>\n<p>We then used a backcasting methodology to trace the evolutionary pathway of polycentric system formation in the watershed. We outlined resource system characteristics and hydrologic linkages (Figure 5), and described the evolution of resource users noting that every basin shifted from agricultural users to urban users (Figure 6).</p>\n<p>We detailed resource user impacts finding that the four most common impacts were: future water shortages, saltwater intrusion, additional cost of new water as a substitute for groundwater, and industrial pollution. We described institutional creation and progress, and analyzed data to illuminate the evolutionary components that had the strongest relationship to polycentric system formation and development.</p>\n<p>Findings indicate that over time a positive relationship developed between pronounced hydrologic linkages and stronger institutional linkages. Moreover, when resource use resulted in significant negative impacts that overlapped basin boundaries, increased conflictual as well as cooperative processes developed between basins to address these impacts. This suggests that the physical characteristics of a common pool resource such as groundwater are a significant factor in the development of institutional relationships that form a polycentric system over time, and that user impacts are a key motivator for both conflictual and cooperative processes between institutions.</p>\n<p>The research provided a deeper understanding of how particular relationships evolve between institutions that manage common pool resources such as groundwater, and the implications of these developmental processes on the polycentric character of a system and the decision-making processes that sustain the resource over time. &nbsp;Future research can tackle how variations in the legal system or the nature of the resource affect evolutionary development.</p>\n<p>Publications and presentations include: How Did We Get Here?: The Evolution of a Polycentric System of Groundwater Governance; at the Seventh World Interdisciplinary Network for
