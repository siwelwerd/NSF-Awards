 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systems used to continuously monitor vital signs in hospitals and home settings generate alarms intended to warn caregivers, clinicians in the hospital, or parents at home of conditions that warrant their immediate attention. However, less than 1% of these alarms are considered actionable or informative, which has led to clinical alarm fatigue being ranged as one of the Top 10 Health Technology Hazards. While there have been advances in human factors, operational factors, and technical factors independently, their interdependencies have yet to be collectively considered. Consequently, current alarm suppression systems aimed at addressing clinical alarm fatigue are generally not extensible, suffer from low adoption rates, and/or have poor performance in practice.\r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to develop foundations for the design of next generation smart alarms. Smart Alarms 2.0 will utilize caregiver-in-the-loop alarm suppression systems to reduce the frequency of non-informative alarms in-clinic and at home. Realizing an effective caregiver-in-the-loop alarm suppression system requires fundamental advances in robust alarm suppression design methodologies and caregiver-in-the-loop modeling and analysis. The potential impact of the proposed design and analysis techniques is evaluated in medical scenarios for alarm suppression applications, spanning pediatric wards and at-home monitoring of Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) patients. This project will lay the foundations for designing caregiver-in-the-loop alarm systems in which physicians, nurses, and parents monitor the right children, at the right times, using optimal alarm settings to maximize informativeness.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our overall aim was to analyze existing systems that generate alarms in the health care environment and think about ways that alarms could be smarter and more informative than they are in current state. There were 3 main products of our collaborative work. First, we worked to understand characteristics of hospitalized pediatric patients that were linked to high numbers of alarms. We learned that younger children, children with complex illnesses, and those needing extra oxygen generated more alarms than average. Second, motivated by reports that children who were born prematurely who were on pulse oximetry monitors at home were generating large numbers of alarms at home, we set out to determine how alarm systems might be able to be better configured in order to minimize unnecessary alarms. We found that under typical circumstances, a family would need to respond to more than 20 alarms at home in a typical night, a number of alarms that could be quite overwhelming. Using simulation, we were able to make recommendations on how the alarm systems could be configured differently to reduce the alarm numbers to more manageable levels without sacrificing the ability to detect important drops in oxygen. Third, we sought to apply data from monitoring systems to address a related problem: when to safely discharge children who were born prematurely from the hospital even if they still need some oxygen to help them breathe effectively. This is a highly actionable question to clinicians, because we are often faced with the difficult decision point of whether to keep a baby in the hospital for a period of weeks to wean off of supplemental oxygen OR to arrange for home oxygen therapy and monitoring on an outpatient basis (the latter of which is less costly than staying in the hospital but may lead to longer periods of supplemental oxygen beyond the point when it is no longer clinically needed, which is inconvenient for families and may be harmful). This aspect of our project is still in progress, and we have some promising preliminary results suggesting that we can use the combination of data from monitors and from the hospital chart to make accurate predictions of the time until the child can safely discontinue their extra oxygen therapy. In summary, this award supported important work in the field of pediatric monitoring, and has provided findings that can lead to improvements in existing monitoring systems and make alarms smarter and more informative to clinicians and families.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/10/2023<br>\nModified by: Christopher&nbsp;Bonafide</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
