 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a state-of-the-art high-speed maskless lithography tool to enable fundamental research in microscale and nanoscale science and engineering at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM). The instrumentation will enable new research collaborations--both within the University and with the broader community--in microfluidics, sensors, nanosystems, and biomedical systems. Fabrication of sophisticated, multiplexed, scalable microfluidic and nanofluidic devices will enable advancement of reconfigurable liquid-metal-based electrical circuits, in vitro testing of drug delivery, chemical-enhanced oil recovery, and water purification.  The MRI award creates new opportunities for science and engineering training through hands-on student research projects and enhanced outreach activities, particularly for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students. \r\n\r\nThe ability to generate high-resolution, controlled mechanical and electrical interfaces is essential for research in engineering, biosciences, and applied physics. The advanced fabrication pathways established by this award will enable fundamental research on nanosystems, energy transport, and manufacturing of reconfigurable devices. Precise lithographic patterning achieved with the instrumentation allows study of fundamental energy transport properties and behaviors, which are needed to expand the library of materials for energy conversion and storage. Patterning of electrodes and other material structures also offers the means to elucidate electrical effects on nanomaterial surface properties, which are fundamental to advancing device miniaturization in nanomanufacturing. Rapid large-scale patterning of microfluidic structures enables research in manufacturing of highly deformable structures and advanced optical features that are needed for wearable biomedical sensors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In pursuit of this acquisition, the University provided more than $150k of renovations to its microfabrication facilities, including upgrades to the clean-room compressed air supply and deionized water supply, operation of a compressed nitrogen supply, and provision of a backup electrical power supply for the new instrument. The capabilities of the new MLA150 instrument enable fundamental research in microscale and nanoscale science and engineering at UH. It enables new research collaborations in microfluidics, sensors, nanosystems, and biomedical systems. More than 15 students and faculty have been trained in operation of the new MLA150 equipment, training documentation has been collected, and a training website has been started. Intellectual Merit: Acquisition of a high-speed maskless lithography tool anchors the operation of the University of Hawaii clean room, and supports applied materials and biomedical research activities across numerous groups at the University of Hawaii. Broader Impacts: Acquisition of this equipment enables many projects for student research and training, including for the significant population of students at UH who come from underrepresented groups. Furthermore, the presence of this tool at the University has helped to raise additional federal funds (AFOSR DURIP) for acquisition of other microfabrication tools. So far, the MLA150 tool has been used in at least 1 paper currently under review for publication.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/16/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Joseph&nbsp;J&nbsp;Brown</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1919539/1919539_10638933_1671227307164_IMG_7388_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1919539/1919539_10638933_1671227307164_IMG_7388_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Commissioning of the MLA150 tool, May 2021.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1919539/1919539_10638933_1671227307164_IMG_7388_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Commissioning of the MLA150 tool, May 2021.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Technician Jush Wu from Heidelberg Instruments trains an initial cohort of students and faculty from the University of Hawaii in operation of the MLA150 tool, May 2021.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Joseph J.
