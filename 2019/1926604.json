 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract\r\nRandom walks of particles serve as a model for many different phenomena.  These include noise, tunneling, topological protection, and the onset of strong correlations. Their applications include precision tests of short-range gravity, and precise measurements of fundamental constants. This work will study quantum coherent random walks of microwave photons using a quantum lattice circuit. It will extend the capabilities of the circuit quantum electrodynamics platform into the regime of quantum many body physics, through the development of correlated state-preparation and measurement tools. By exploring the interplay of tunneling, topology, and interactions in a setting with sufficient coherence to permit the emergence of substantial entanglement, we will have the opportunity to develop intuition and quantitative coarse-grained models of correlated electronic transport in materials. These studies will train students in the intellectual and experimental tools of quantum science and quantum information that will play an increasingly central role in the US and worldwide economies.\r\n \r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nInitial work will explore quantum-coherent random walks of individual photons in a 1D Bose-Hubbard quantum circuit lattice developed by the principal investigators, and then extend this technique to entangled walks of multiple photons in higher dimensions. This work will not only advance the state-of-the-art for manipulation, control, and readout of large circuit QED platforms, but will provide essential insights into the role of quantum correlations in the dynamics of interacting particles, with direct implications for electrons in high mobility 2DEGs and correlated electron materials in general.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
