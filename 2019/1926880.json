 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology (BCST) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will conduct a consensus study that will survey the current state of the chemical engineering discipline and its contributions to society and articulate a vision for the future of chemical engineering. Chemical engineers not only draw from the traditional chemical sciences, but from physics, mathematics,  computation, and, increasingly, biology to shape the technological infrastructure of modern society from energy and consumer products to personalized medicine. One indicator of the impact of chemical engineering to society is the 2015 American Chemistry Council estimate that the breadth of chemical industries contributed nearly 26% of the US GDP, while supporting over six million jobs.\r\n\r\nThe study will be conducted by an ad hoc committee with a range of expertise across academia, National Laboratories, and the private sector, and will result in a report that is freely accessible to the public. The study will also benefit from extensive community input throughout its conduct. The primary objective of this study is to provide a compelling vision and strategy for chemical engineering research, innovation, and education for the next 10 to 30 years. The report will provide guidance to research sponsors, as well as to the research communities in academia and industry. The report's recommendations will focus on science needs and priorities rather than specific funding or organizational aspects. The study will address the changing needs of the chemical industry in the 21st century, develop ways to more effectively engage with and learn from related fields, discuss approaches for anticipating potential unintended as well as intended consequences that affect society and the environment, develop ways to strengthen diversity within the chemical engineering community, and point the way to a modern chemical engineering curriculum. The broader impacts of the study will extend beyond the chemical engineering community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
