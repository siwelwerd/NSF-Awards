 "awd_abstract_narration": "Distant luminous quasars directly probe the birth of the earliest supermassive black holes and the end of cosmic dark ages through cosmic reionization. We will conduct a multi-wavelength survey of a sample of about 30 quasars at distances exceeding 13 billion light years. This dataset will allow us to study how the young galaxies and quasars ended the cosmic dark ages about one billion years after the big bang, and how early black hole growth interacted with early galaxy formation. This project will also partner with the Flandrau Science Center & Planetarium at the University of Arizona to develop a summer program called Black Hole Week that will have broad impacts in education and outreach. \r\n\r\nLuminous quasars at high redshift provide direct probes of the evolution of supermassive black holes and the intergalactic medium at early cosmic time. This project will carry out a spectroscopy survey of about 30 quasars at redshift seven in optical and far-infrared wavelengths. This survey will map the history of reionization at its most active phase, and provide a first census of the relation between rapid black hole growth and galaxy assembly during the reionization era.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
