 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extreme storms, high tide flooding, tsunamis, earthquakes, and other natural events pose high risk to coastal communities and cause billions of dollars of damage. Although the geophysical forcing leading to the flooding may be regional in nature, the intensity and duration of the flooding may exhibit significant temporal or spatial variability over a range of scales. Advancing technologies for low-cost instrumentation that can be rapidly deployed by citizen scientists will allow for scientists and local communities to  address the chronic under-sampling problem by collecting critical observations of extreme flooding.  A lending library for instruments that are able to measuring localized flooding will be created. The observations collected by citizen scientists will serve as a resource for coastal geologists and planners focused on the predictions of flooding and the structural response of the landscape to extreme events. This knowledge could provide information to communities faced with emergency response and coastal adaptation decisions.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project engages three cohorts of citizen scientists (undergraduate students, Extension Science Volunteers (ESVs), and coastal residents) in a collaborative citizen science project. High-resolution flooding observations from a range of extreme flooding situations will be collected by the various citizen scientist groups.  This exploratory project will, from the onset, engage the geophysical and citizen science disciplines to capitalize on recent technological advancements for the goal of transforming our capacity for high-resolution geophysical field sampling.  Our objectives are to 1) develop low cost sensors with students and ESVs as partners, 2) create a coastal flooding instrumentation lending library (CFILL) accessible to coastal residents, 3) provide training on the use of the instruments and test the usability of CFILL protocols with citizen science volunteers, and 4) deploy the sensors in collaboration with coastal residents to facilitate high-resolution sampling of parcel and community-level flooding and inundation. Advancing technologies for low-cost instrumentation that can be rapidly deployed by citizen scientists will transform our ability to address the chronic under-sampling problem by collecting critical observations of extreme flooding.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nIn 2019, the University of New Hampshire (UNH) received a $299,121.52 Coastlines and People EAGER award entitled Mobilizing our Coastal Communities: Facilitating Rapid Response Observations of Extreme Event Flooding, Inundation, and Overwash. This project engaged three cohorts of citizen scientists (undergraduate students, Extension Science Volunteers (ESVs), and coastal residents) in research and monitoring toward increased understanding of coastal flooding and inundation in NH coastal communities. We explored the impacts of this collaborative approach on student motivation to pursue STEM careers, knowledge of community flood hazards, and perception of citizen science reliability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project leveraged a full-year research course for first-year students called Innovation Scholars. Each year the college of engineering and physical sciences supports 4-5 cohorts of courses ranging from advanced manufacturing to biomaterials to internet engineering to ocean and environmental sensing. A total of 51 (16, 16, 19) first year undergraduates students participated in the full year ocean and environmental sensing section over the project duration. These students all participate in 1-3 field trips to fields sites and learn about how they may apply skills they are learning in their major to issues affecting coastal communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe students were all declared engineering and science majors with approximately 70% of the students declared as an engineering major (ocean, environmental, mechanical, bio, chemical) and 30% declared as physical science majors (earth sciences, chemistry, mathematics, physics, computer science). There is some fluidity to this estimate due to first year students commonly changing their majors. Average retention rate between the two semesters was 85% (88%, 81%, 89%) over the course of the three year project. Each year the students worked in teams to complete 4-5 projects. The students and course instructors worked closely with UNH Cooperative Extension volunteers, and members of NH coastal communities to develop low-cost, high-resolution tools toward increasing our understanding of coastal flood risks and impacts. Projects included the development of pressure and temperature sensing instruments to monitoring water levels on beaches and in flood prone residential areas, the development of a weather station to collect localized weather data, and the collection of beach profile data to understand beach elevation change. All of the 14 projects were presented in the spring at the University of New Hampshires Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Undergraduate Research Conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents engaged with NH coastal community members on place-based field trips at the beginning of each project year. Community members shared stories of their experiences with flooding and observations of coastline change over time. These interactions served to guide student idea development and ground project goals in addressing real world, local problems. Volunteers from UNH Cooperative Extensions Coastal Research Volunteer and Marine Docent programs served in ongoing mentorship roles throughout the course of the yearlong student projects. Extension volunteers provided additional capacity to the classroom, supporting students in drafting workplans and timelines, and supporting project implementation, data collection, and analysis. Extension volunteers played important roles in moving student projects out of the laboratory and connecting instrument collected data to the local issues students heard about from community members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA survey was administered to undergraduate students to understand the impacts of their engagement with Extension volunteers and community members on their motivation to pursue STEM careers, knowledge of community flood hazards, and perception of citizen science reliability. Surveys were administered via email at the beginning (pre-survey) and end (post-survey) of each academic year from 2021-2023. As dictated by the rules of the IRB, student participation in pre- and post-surveys was optional and not presented as a class assignment. All survey results were anonymous and individual student responses were not tracked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough sample sizes are small, survey results of undergraduate students help further our understanding of the efficacy of using a collaborative participatory science approach for an undergraduate engineering design class. Data from respondents indicated an increased perception that a career in science would allow them to make substantial contributions, both scientifically and beyond. In addition, students increased their perception of flooding risk for coastal NH residents, and gained more nuanced understanding of flood impacts, including a greater understanding of impacts to individual residents and the relationship of loss of coastal landforms such as marshes and dunes to flooding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting student projects to real world problems through an engaged research approach increased student knowledge of coastal community flood hazards, understanding of flooding impacts on coastal residents, and perception of a future science career that can make meaningful societal contributions. Survey results also point to the promise of community engagement in scientific work (i.e., citizen science) as a method of engaged scholarship.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/01/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AlysonEberhardt\n"
