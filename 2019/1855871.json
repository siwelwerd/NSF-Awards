 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will promote participation of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the research programs of the 14 Institutes of the Manufacturing USA, which are sponsored by the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology.  The objective of the workshop is to formulate a strategy for promoting and sustaining robust research and educational collaborations between the faculty and students of the HBCUs and the faculty members and industry scientists and engineers participating in the Manufacturing USA Institutes.\r\n\r\nThe 2.5-day workshop will bring together senior personnel from the Institutes and the HBCUs to support NSF?s policy goal of broadening the participation of all populations and ethnicities in science and engineering research, innovation and education. The resulting faculty collaborations in advanced manufacturing are expected to lead to increased research and innovation projects and output, significantly increased research experiences for both undergraduate and graduate students at the HBCUs, and the matriculation of more minority students in graduate programs at top research universities in advanced manufacturing and other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields of study. The workshop will formulate a strategy for: (1) catalyzing increased fundamental research, innovation, technology development, and knowledge transfer in advanced manufacturing at HBCUs, (2) improving HBCU faculty development in advanced manufacturing, 3) increasing opportunities for HBCU researchers to submit collaborative proposals with Manufacturing USA collaborators, 4) providing access to the state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment and expertise available at the Institutes, and 5) facilitating information and personnel exchanges between the HBCUs and the Manufacturing USA Institutes, including seminars, conferences, and summer research experiences for the students and faculty of the HBCUs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
