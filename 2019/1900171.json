 "awd_abstract_narration": "2020 Vision for Dynamics will be held in the Mathematical Research and Conference Center Bedlewo of the Institute of Mathematics at the Academy of Sciences of Poland from August 11 to 16, 2019. The conference will focus on topics related to elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic dynamical systems and smooth ergodic theory that have seen much progress, but where significant problems vital to the field remain open. Based on forward-looking presentations of recent developments, the conference will set a broad and concrete agenda for further research on several fronts and bring together senior, mid-career and young practitioners for discussions of open problems in these research areas.  More information can be found at: https://www.impan.pl/en/activities/banach-center/conferences/19-vision2020\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
