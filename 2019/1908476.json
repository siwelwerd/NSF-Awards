 "awd_abstract_narration": "Children born in the mid 2010s in the United States are arguably part of the first generation that has been able to make meaningful use of computer devices for as long as they can remember. Given this, it is important to make available technologies that benefit young children's development.  One area of development that is often overlooked is self-regulation. Several large studies show that high-quality social play helps young children develop self-regulation, which in turn enables children to perform better in kindergarten and beyond. High-quality social play typically involves groups of children engaged in pretend play that includes common goals, planning, role-play, interactive social dialogue, negotiation, improvisation, and the use of generic physical props as opposed to realistic toys.  However, implementing high-quality social play requires a significant amount of teacher training.  This project will focus on lowering barriers to facilitating high-quality social play activities through the development of StoryCarnival. StoryCarnival will consist of an application for teachers and caregivers to set up and plan play activities, and voice agents to support high-quality social play as it happens.  The development of StoryCarnival will lead to novel explorations of voice agents to facilitate face-to-face social activities.  The software developed will be freely available and outreach activities will include national and regional conferences for preschool educators.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses three main research gaps brought about by the increasing availability of interactive technologies for young children: identifying common and critical skill deficits for 3-4 year old children that may be addressed through interactive technologies; developing design methods to use with this age group; and identifying technologies other than mobile devices that may be developmentally appropriate for this population, sustainable, and broadly available. This project will expand on prior research that identified executive functions including self-regulation as a common, critical skill deficit for 3-4 year old children, and high-quality social play as an activity that can enhance these skills and may be facilitated through interactive technologies. This project builds on this foundation with the primary objective of developing and evaluating an innovative approach to voice agents through StoryCarnival, an app to facilitate high-quality social play that supports wide distribution, data collection, English and Spanish language use, and long-term deployments. With this infrastructure, the project will then focus on the iterative development and evaluation of voice agents combining caregiver control with smart recommendations. The approach will be to enable caregivers to keep track of play context, give them options for voice agent control based on context, and ask them for feedback on how well specific agent interactions worked in order to improve dialogue and activity recommendations. The project will include evaluations of the impact of StoryCarnival on high-quality social play through a combination of field studies and automated use logs and surveys with a larger number of users.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The 4Cs approach argues for more technologies designed for young children to support face-to-face communication, connect children with their social and physical environment, facilitate creative activities, and be under the control of children and/or their caregivers. The 4Cs approach was developed as a reaction to many children's technologies leading to social isolation, a primary focus on electronic devices, either passively experiencing media or participating in activities highly structured by technology, and a loss of control over data, decision-making, and time. One of the key goals of the project was to move from the aspirational aspects of the 4Cs approach to a concrete example illustrating how a 4Cs technology could be designed and implemented.</p>\n<p>The technology developed to instantiate the 4Cs approach is called StoryCarnival. It is intended to lower the barriers to social roleplay activities in the style of the Tools of the Mind (ToM) approach to enhance the self-regulation of preschool children. StoryCarnival consists of interactive stories, a play planner, and facilitator-controlled tangible voice agents to better support ToM-style play. During a StoryCarnival session, children experience a story to inspire social roleplay, plan who will play what character, and then play with each other pretending to be characters in the story with the support of StoryCarnival's tangible voice agent. During social roleplay, their attention is primarily on peers and on non-electronic physical props (e.g., wooden blocks), with the only electronic item being the tangible voice agent, a toy that speaks to children, with all speech controlled by an adult facilitator (e.g., a teacher or therapist). StoryCarnival can be experienced without any screen by printing materials, although it is possible to experience its stories and the play planner through an app. StoryCarnival is free to the public, available at <a href=\"https://storycarnival.cs.uiowa.edu/\">https://storycarnival.cs.uiowa.edu/</a>.</p>\n<p>We designed StoryCarnival through a collaboration of computer scientists, informaticians, teachers, therapists, creative writers, graphic artists, and children. In fact, to involve preschool children in the design of the system, we developed a novel method to give them a voice, which has since been used by other researchers.</p>\n<p>Besides making StoryCarnival publicly available we have had many other positive results. First, we found evidence that running social roleplay sessions in a preschool with StoryCarnival resulted in better outcomes when compared to running similar sessions without technology supports, including greater integration of shy children and more mature play characteristics. These seemed related both to the type of open-ended stories we used to set up play and to the use of the tangible voice agent, which helped integrate children into play. We also found evidence of quick increases in social initiations by preschool children when using the system daily.</p>\n<p>Second, when therapists used the system with groups of neurodivergent children, we found that the flexibility of StoryCarnival enabled therapists to independently use it and adapt it to groups of children with different needs, abilities, and preferences. For example, one set of sessions involved children who were not a good fit for any other group social activity the therapists had available. In other words, StoryCarnival was a last resort for them and despite this high bar, most of the children benefited from the activity. Part of the reason for StoryCarnival's success was its flexibility which seemed to be a good fit for the therapists as they would typically spend time preparing for sessions. They mentioned StoryCarnival reduced preparation time for them, but planning to dedicate time to thinking about how to use StoryCarnival also led to more successful use.</p>\n<p>Third, we have identified higher-level lessons both for the media that we have developed as part of the system and for the characteristics of systems similar to StoryCarnival (following the 4Cs, create, connect, communicate, and control). For media, we found it very useful in preparation for our sessions at the therapy center to partner with the therapists, to understand the skills they wanted to promote, and with a group of creative writers to incorporate that skill promotion into engaging stories. For the 4Cs approach, we went deeper into providing a theoretical background for it and identified other technologies for young children that fully or partially fit within the 4Cs.</p>\n<p>Overall, this has been a very successful project with positive outcomes in terms of research findings, publications, freely available resources for the public, impact on children, and training of students (2 graduated PhDs who are now professors, 23 undergraduate students).</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/01/2024<br>\nModified by: Juan Pablo&nbsp;Hourcade</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div
