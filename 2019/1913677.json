 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project seeks to produce a first of its kind educational technology application for the development of emotional literacy among adolescent and adult learners. Emotional literacy is increasingly recognized as a universal need that is critical to one's academic and professional success and psychological health, as well as for society's cohesion and tolerance. At the same time, modern emotion science indicates that emotions operate on the basis of certain basic, universal principles, which represent the deep structure of our social and emotional life. The present application will focus on teaching these fundamental principles, encapsulated by a comprehensive emotion system model developed based on the latest scientific research. To foster deep learning, the training will emphasize inference-making and the use of simulations, while being grounded in high quality narrative such as literature and film. Training exercise generation will be partially automated to provide content variability. The project has the potential to have a broader impact on education practice and outcomes by leading to more robust, transferable, and measurable learning of social-emotional concepts and skills. It promises to make a further valuable societal contribution by offering an affordable, effective and engaging mobile solution for enhancing emotional literacy among the general population, helping to build a more aware, tolerant, just, and peaceful society. At the same time, the application has the potential to capture a significant portion of a combined $1.5 billion social-emotional learning and consumer emotional wellness market, resulting in a self-sustaining business generating jobs and significant income for tax revenue. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe project entails a number of technical innovations, including: a data model and management system for the encoding of emotion episodes in literature and film; an emotion exercise generation engine for automating the creation of training exercises; an effective user interface for the presentation of emotion principles and the associated training exercises, particularly those involving emotion system simulation; and emotion knowledge performance analytics dashboard(s). The main goals of the proposed R&D include: assessing the viability of developing the emotion exercise generation engine and a production-ready version of the application; evaluating the benefits of the training for application users; and assessing the commercial viability of the product in the educational and consumer markets. The technical goals will be achieved through rapid, agile development using technologies such as python, a cross-platform mobile development framework such as React Native, and a graph database like Neo4J. Platform training benefits will be evaluated using randomized control studies at multiple stages of product development to allow for iteration and improvement. Commercial viability will be assessed through direct outreach to schools and other educational institutions, as well as a beta launch aimed at the consumer market.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is innovative in four key respects: what it is teaching, how this is being taught, how the outcomes are measured, and the underlying engine and data model that make this possible. Unlike existing solutions, the platform focuses on teaching fundamental emotion science principles, such as situational appraisal, encapsulated by a comprehensive emotion system model developed on the basis of the latest scientific research.&nbsp; At the same time, the training format is designed to help users build an accurate mental model of the emotion system by emphasizing inference-making and the use of simulations, while being grounded in high quality narrative such as film and TV excerpts.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The major technical innovation at the heart of the application was to be a specialized engine that would handle automated generation of training exercises targeting specific principles of the emotion system. The engine was to handle several key tasks, including generating individual exercises based on particular narrative emotion episodes (i.e. TV and film clips), and assembling training units based on user progress and performance history. This would allow for fast and low-cost content generation, providing users with ample training materials to master the principles being taught, as well as to continue to hone their skills over the long term.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The majority of the goals for this Phase I project have been successfully accomplished, including developing an alpha version of the exercise generation engine and a web-based application for the development of emotional literacy. As part of the project, a full 12-unit emotional literacy training curriculum was developed, featuring illustrations, review quizzes, as well as an ?evolving? set of emotion system diagrams reflecting the incremental progress through the components and processes that comprise the emotion system. To the best of the team?s knowledge, this is the first time that instructional diagrams (i.e. those used in an emotion education context) of a model of the emotion system have been developed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project outcomes have significant implications for the social emotional learning (SEL) space. First, the project demonstrates that it is possible to use a model of the emotion system to generate exercises targeting social emotional skills that are coupled with high quality popular media. This provides a blueprint for creating authentic, engaging, and culturally responsive SEL training content that can be effectively scaled for wide adoption and long-term engagement. At the same time, the project demonstrates the viability of individualized learning in the SEL context, as users are able to select narrative titles with which they wish to train.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Furthemore, social emotional skills and the changes in those skills are notoriously difficult to measure. At present, SEL practitioners are mostly limited to relying on self-report, with a shortage of easily deployable performance-based measurement tools. This project demonstrates the possibility of developing objective, precise and scalable SEL skill measurement solutions.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, by creating a curriculum focused on fundamental emotion science principles that comprise the emotion system, the project is the first to operationalize a deep emotion learning solution, which can help learners transfer their emotion knowledge and skills to new context and situations--a key goal of all educational endeavors and especially of SEL.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the same time, user testing has shown that the application?s approach resonates with both educators and high school students, with an overwhelming majority of participants in both groups providing highly positive feedback regarding their experience using the product.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Taken together, these outcomes indicate that the project has made a unique and potentially transformative contribution to SEL practice and beyond.
