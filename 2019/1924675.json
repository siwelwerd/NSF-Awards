 "awd_abstract_narration": "Snapping shrimp in the genus Alpheus, known for their spectacular color patterns and the explosive snap created by their major claw, are one of the most diverse and abundant animal groups in tropical coral reefs. Snapping shrimp form mutualistic relationships with a diversity of partners such as corals and fish and are emerging as a model group for understanding symbiosis and species diversification in marine environments. However, such studies require a more complete understanding of how many different species of Alpheus exist worldwide, and the relationships among these species. This research will address these questions by building an evolutionary tree of the group with next-generation DNA sequencing data. These data will be used to test whether factors such as host symbioses or color patterns drove the spectacular diversification of this group. Studying the biodiversity of this group will help to understand more broadly the origins and maintenance of biodiversity in shallow marine tropical ecosystems. Species pages will be created through the Encyclopedia of Life for public outreach and educational purposes, and a partnership with a science museum will develop workshops in science communication for undergraduates. A graduate student, and multiple undergraduates will also be trained in genetic barcoding, species delimitation, species descriptions, and comparative evolutionary analyses.  \r\n\t\r\nThis research will produce the first comprehensive global phylogeny of snapping shrimp in the genus Alpheus, spanning >50% of the 300+ described species and using phylogenomic data generated via anchored hybrid enrichment. This phylogeny will be used to test long-standing taxonomic and morphological questions in Alpheus, such as the monophyly of morphologically defined species groups and the role of habitat use in driving instances of morphological convergence. A comprehensive genetic barcoding survey of field and museum specimens will help estimate the existing worldwide biodiversity of the group. Using phylogenetic reconstructions, fieldwork, and color pattern analyses, researchers will test whether color patterns - long hypothesized to have systematic importance - are important factors in establishing species boundaries. Finally, the phylogenomic tree and data on worldwide patterns of species diversity will be used to test whether species diversification in Alpheus is linked to ecological factors such as symbiosis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nSnapping shrimp are amongst the most abundant and diverse animals living on coral reefs. They are known for their enlarged claw, which they use to make the distinctive snapping noises that give them their name. The sound of snapping shrimps is one of the most prevalent high-frequency sounds on coral reefs, and acts as an important acoustic signal helping reef fish settle in healthy coral habitats. Snapping shrimps are also some of the most charismatic and colorful crustaceans living on coral reefs, and many live in symbiotic relationships with animals such as sea anemones, corals, and burrow-dwelling goby fishes. Yet despite their important ecological roles and substantial diversity, we still have an unclear picture of how many species of snapping shrimp there are, and how they are evolutionarily related.\r\n\n\nFocusing on snapping shrimp in the genus Alpheus, this project aimed to (i) estimate worldwide diversity of snapping shrimp using genetic barcoding, (ii) use genomic sequencing to build a worldwide evolutionary tree, and (iii) use these data to test questions about how morphology and habitat have shaped Alpheus diversity. This collaborative project engaged several early-career scientists, including a graduate student funded by the project, a post-baccalaureate student, 40 undergraduates, and additional postdoctoral collaborators. Students had the opportunity to conduct field research, learn and develop techniques in genetics and morphological analysis, and present their data at professional meetings. Undergraduates were also involved in public outreach activities, and helped develop an online snapping shrimp activity for K-2 students hosted by the Pacific Science Center in Seattle. PI Hultgren and co-PI Hurt also worked with filmmakers in the field in Curacao to assist with a nature documentary that will feature snapping shrimp.\r\n\n\nGenetic barcoding of shrimp sampled from the field and from natural history museums indicates that there are several undescribed, potentially new species of Alpheus. Genetic barcodes were generated from 700 specimens across nearly 200 different described species of Alpheus, and analyses of this dataset indicate that there are several groups of genetically distinct individuals that may represent potentially new species. Another subproject, led by a graduate student, pioneered the use of a method called geometric morphometrics to diagnose closely related species of Alpheus based on subtle differences in shape.\r\n\n\nCapitalizing on recently published genomic markers for crustaceans, this project also produced an evolutionary tree of Alpheus from around the world. This tree indicates that different lineages of Alpheus species have diversified into specialized habitats, such as the deep sea, independently. Together with extensive data on habitat use and morphology, these phylogenomic and genetic data allowed tests of several evolutionary hypotheses. For example, an evolutionary analysis focusing on the burrowing species of snapping shrimps, many of whom form symbiotic relationships with burrow-dwelling goby fishes, has shown that burrowing behavior has evolved in multiple lineages of snapping shrimp, and burrowing behavior is related to modifications in claw morphology. Finally, this project also generated an extensive genomic dataset on opsin genes, which regulate vision in crustaceans, allowing future work on to understand the genomics behind vision in these colorful and diverse snapping shrimps.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/09/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KristinMHultgren\n"
