 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ACM Sigmetrics 2019 conference will be held at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix, Arizona from June 24-28, 2019, and will be part of the ACM Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC) 2019. Sigmetrics is the premier forum for discussing the development and application of state-of-the-art, broadly applicable analytic, simulation, and measurement-based performance evaluation techniques. Historically, Sigmetrics brings together 200 or more professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds. The technical program of Sigmetrics includes research and work-in-progress poster presentations of refereed papers, workshops, tutorials, panel discussions, and invited keynote talks by the world's leading experts in the area of performance evaluation of computer systems. Sigmetrics provides an international forum for presentation of original research results as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative and practical systems modeling ideas, which are particularly valuable for student participants. \r\n\r\nThis grant provides travel support for about 25 U.S. based graduate student participants to attend the Sigmetrics 2019 conference. A strong representation of U.S. researchers at the conference, particularly students, is essential in maintaining U.S. competitiveness. This grant will provide travel support for students based on merit and need, and particular emphasis will be placed on diversity for the selection of awardees to increase participation of under-represented groups. This support will help students attend the conference and interact with professionals in both industry and academia. Taking part in the educational experiences available at Sigmetrics, including tutorial sessions and workshops, will provide students with important learning and mentoring opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
