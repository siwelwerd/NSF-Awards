 "awd_abstract_narration": "As computing has become integral to the practice of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), the STEM+Computing program seeks to address challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school. Scientific inquiry often requires scientists to use large datasets and computational models to advance knowledge about the structure and functions of complex systems, and to predict changes in those systems. Middle and high school students will be engaged in these scientific processes by infusing the computational practices and thinking needed to model, visualize, and communicate atmospheric processes and changes into science teaching and learning. The project will design, develop, and test eight learning modules for middle and high school students that integrate computational practices and thinking with atmospheric science through use of data analysis, visualization, and modeling of large-scale weather datasets. Each of the modules will engage students in using a free, open-source application for analyzing and visualizing geoscience data. Each module will also emphasize the following computational science concepts and practices: 1) The ability to access and manipulate data, 2) The ability to use computational tools to analyze and interpret data, and 3) The application of computational reasoning and model-based understanding to construct quantitative, scientific explanations and predictions about events and processes in atmospheric systems. Teachers will be participate in developing and testing new approaches to teaching an learning, as well as development of a framework for supporting ongoing teacher efforts to create new instructional materials that integrate computational thinking science practices.  \r\n\r\nThis project will use a design-based research approach to test the hypothesis that science education empowered by large-scale atmospheric datasets and fused with computational thinking and practices will: 1) promote meaningful science learning as envisioned by the Next Generation Science Standards, and 2) foster literacy in atmospheric and computational sciences among middle and high school students. The project team includes academic specialists in instructional systems and workforce development, geoscience, electrical and computer engineering, and a high-performance computer collaboratory, and this team will collaborate with schoolteachers from eight school districts to develop, test, and implement the new learning modules. The project will directly engage approximately 44 secondary school teachers and 2,000 of their students. The work of the project is guided by five objectives: 1) Develop and test 3D Weather learning modules that integrate computational thinking and practices into atmospheric science learning through data analysis, and 3D visualization and interpretation of large-scale weather data; 2) Develop and conduct teacher professional development that supports integration of computational thinking and practices into secondary science instruction and empowers secondary science learning with large-scale weather data; 3) Investigate how the integration of 3D Weather data modeling and visualization into Earth and environmental science classes support students' and teachers' development of computational thinking and model-based understanding of the complexity of the atmospheric systems; 4) Investigate teachers' experiences and perceptions of integrating computational thinking and practices into atmospheric science instruction in order to learn how to support teachers to engage in these instructional practices, and 5) Develop a research-based framework guiding teachers' future efforts of developing new instructional materials integrating computational thinking and practices into science instruction. Research activities related to each of these objectives will be employed to guide the iterative process of improving educational practices through analysis, design, development, and implementation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
