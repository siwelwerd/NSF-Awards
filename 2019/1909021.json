 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robots can only grasp \"accessible\" objects, objects with clearance for the robot's gripper or fingers.  Unfortunately, objects are often kept tightly packed, for efficient storage or transport, like the silverware in a drawer.  Acquiring such an inaccessible object is called \"unpacking\".  Unpacking requires the shifting of an object, or the surrounding clutter, without a conventional grasp.  In current practice, unpacking is almost always performed by humans.  This project identifies different classes of unpacking problems, and explores solutions for each class. Unpacking by robots will increase the impact of robotics in applications of strategic and economic importance such as manufacturing and logistics.  Unpacking problems also arise in the household and in health care institutions.\r\n \r\nThe project's activities include classification based on the object, and the surrounding clutter.  The project proceeds by refining a preliminary classification, identifying representative benchmark problems for each class, and identifying the challenges particular to each class or cutting across several classes.   The project will explore novel effector designs, controls, modeling, and planning.  One key broadly applicable approach, when access to an object's surface is limited, is to use \"partial closure\" -- insufficient for a stable grasp, but sufficient to shift an object or the surrounding clutter, increasing accessibility of the object.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWhy is it hard to pull a book out of a tightly packed bookshelf, the first cigar out of a cigar box, the first card out of a box of cards, or the first domino out of a box of dominos? Because there is no room for your fingers to reach in or around the object to get a good grasp. When that happens, we say the object is \"inaccessible.\"\n\n\n\nThe problem is the surrounding stuff: the clutter. The clutter problem is worse than we used to think. In manufacturing automation systems, we can control the clutter, but not in logistics. It is essential in logistics that items be densely packed, for efficient transport and storage. It is also essential in your own home. Almost everything is in a container or a bin. Silverware neatly stacked in trays. Other tools in drawers. Spice jars crammed together. In order to use something, you have to get it from the densely-packed state to the accessible state -- you have to unpack it. The focus of this project is how to unpack objects -- the \"unpacking problem.\"\n\n\n\nThe key is to use the surrounding objects, the clutter, for additional contact points. For example, think about how you get a book out of a tightly packed bookcase. You cannot get your fingers in between the books. There is no good grasp. But if you put one finger on top of a book and pull, the book pivots out, exposing enough surface for you to get a good grasp. When you do that, you are using the contact between the book and the shelf, as if the shelf were another finger. In previous work we called this technique a form of \"extrinsic dexterity.\"\n\n\n\nThe problem addressed in this project was how to use extrinsic dexterity to unpack inaccessible objects. It brought together several pieces of work. Because the fingertip motions are constrained, we developed a new type of compliant control, a variant of a control technique called \"hybrid force-velocity control.\" To identify all possible arrangements of contact points and relative motions between the object and the clutter, we developed a new algorithm, the first-ever efficient algorithm to enumerate contact modes in three dimensions. To do the experiments we used a conventional commercial arm and gripper, but also the DDHand (the first-ever direct drive hand), and a \"delta array\" gripper being developed by another NSF project. Finally, we needed a behavior planning system, to find the contact points and the motions that would unpack inaccessible objects. For this we developed a hierarchical system, that first examines possible object motions, then feasible contacts, then the gripper motions.\n\n\n\nFinally all of these elements were combined in several experimental demonstrations, manipulating inaccessible objects using extrinsic dexterity.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/08/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MatthewTMason\n"
