 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nAdvanced materials design for technological applications such as ion conduction, filtration, photoelectric generation, or composite reinforcement is focused on combining different material components at the nanoscale level.  This creates systems where nearly all parts are near an interface making the resulting performance primarily dependent on the local material properties near these interfaces.  Recent observations have demonstrated an unanticipated strong coupling of dynamics across dissimilar polymer interfaces established during final materials processing and interface formation.  The planned research aims to understand what controls this dynamical coupling across dissimilar polymer domains and how interfaces mediate this behavior.  Experiments on simplified systems using a series of different techniques will be carried out to investigate what property changes take place in multilayer systems during interface formation and how they alter the dynamics across the material.  Integrated with this research will be education of students as well as outreach.  Outreach efforts by the PI involve a partnership with Emory's Carlos Museum education programs to develop STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) programing for teachers and school groups covering scientific concepts used by ancient cultures such as historical water management strategies.  In collaboration with the Museum's Chief Conservator, undergraduate research projects will characterize polymer resins and their applications used in artwork conservation.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe planned research aims to understand what controls dynamical coupling across dissimilar polymer domains and how interfaces mediate this behavior.  Experiments on simplified systems using a series of different techniques will be carried out to investigate what property changes take place in multilayer systems during interface annealing that alter the dynamics across the material.  Comparison of results using multiple experimental techniques on a given system will provide a fuller picture of the relevant phenomena and thus facilitate improved understanding.  Experiments on multilayer films with varying layer thicknesses will be done using the following techniques:  quartz crystal microscopy to investigate changes in shear wave propagation across dissimilar polymer interfaces upon progressive interface annealing, ellipsometry to study changes in physical aging due to the impact of glassy-rubbery polymer interfaces, and differential scanning calorimetry to compare glass transition breadths and temperature-dependent heat capacities.  Results from these techniques will be correlated or contrasted to localized depth-dependent measurements of the glass transition temperature using fluorescence on equivalent systems.  The goals of this project are to address which experimentally measurable factors change during interface formation leading to dynamical coupling between different polymer domains, and how finite domain sizes (changing boundary conditions) alter this phenomenon.  \r\n.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The research of this project was focused on understanding perturbations to local material properties that occur near such interfaces. Using a series of different innovative experimental techniques that can probe polymer material properties at scales of only a few nanometers, this project was able to demonstrate a link between how interfaces perturb several different kinds of material properties spanning the glass transition temperature, modulus, and index of refraction. By studying how high frequency sounds waves travel across polymer interfaces between glassy and rubbery domains, this research demonstrated long range gradients in local modulus spanning hundreds of nanometers in accordance with previous gradients in the glass transition. A new mechanism for how density fluctuations could be coupled in glasses over large distances was proposed to explain the observed behavior, which could have implications across a range of different glass systems beyond polymers. Investigations of how polymer chains attached to surfaces in different ways can slow dynamics and locally increase the glass transition temperature were also done, providing new molecular insight into how stiffness and adhesion is achieved in films and nanocomposite systems.\n\n\nThe research efforts of this project were carried out by graduate and undergraduate students who were exposed to this interdisciplinary field bridging physics, chemistry, and materials science.
