 "awd_abstract_narration": "The strong interaction sector of the Standard Model of particle physics, described by the theory of quarks and gluons, QCD, presents a rich variety of phenomena, asymptotic freedom, confinement, and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking among the most fundamental ones, which determine the structure and dynamics of hadrons and nuclei. The understanding of those phenomena drives significant contemporary experimental and theoretical research efforts, where a variety of observables and processes are studied in order to shed light onto the complex landscape of strongly interacting matter. Through the application of theoretical approaches known as effective theories, this project aims at studying baryons, their static as well as dynamic properties which are relevant to the mentioned phenomena and to the present experimental efforts at several laboratories. Baryons are subatomic particles, such as nucleons or hyperons. A key objective of the project is to develop the effective theory tools that will permit a more accurate description of baryons at low and intermediate energies. The project is also invested in the research participation of  graduate and undergraduate students, and it has the potential to enhance diversity in theoretical nuclear physics through its location at Hampton University. \r\n \r\nThe goals of the project concentrate on the study of the physics of hadrons at low and intermediate energies, domains where the non-perturbative nature of the strong interactions is most prominent.  The understanding of many of the hadron observables, such as form factors, electromagnetic polarizabilities, low energy hadron-hadron scattering, nuclear forces, etc, remains a work in progress where there is broad  theoretical, experimental and lattice QCD activity. Through the use of the methods of effective theories, which are rigorously anchored in the strictures  of QCD, a description of hadronic physics in those domains is possible, and with it an understanding of interrelations between different observables becomes possible. The program will concentrate on the study of baryons, namely protons, neutrons and their cousins the strange baryons, as well as their low lying excited states. It will entail the further development of effective theory tools, in this case chiral effective theory and the 1/Nc expansion, and their applications to baryon observables, in particular those not well understood, such as low energy (virtual) Compton scattering and corresponding polarizabilities, single-spin asymmetries in electron-nucleon scattering, low energy pion-nucleon scattering, and applications to results being obtained in lattice QCD calculations on baryon structure and the dependencies on quark masses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The dynamics of QCD is characterized by non-perturbative phenomena which in particular inhibit the observation of free or quasi free quarks and gluons. The observable degrees of freedom are hadrons, composites of quarks and gluons, those of integer spins are mesons and those of half-integer spins are baryons. The study of the spectra of hadrons and of their structures has as one of the most important aims the understanding of the non-perturbative phenomena of QCD. This involves studies, both theoretical and experimental, in all ranges of energy. This project, titled Hadronic and Nuclear Structure and Dynamics, has focused on the low energy regime of QCD in the light quark sector. In that regime a non-perturbative phenomenon plays a key role, namely spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, which gives rise to the light mesons known as quasi-Goldstone bosons GB). A description of QCD in that regime is then possible using hadronic degrees of freedom, namely GBs and baryons, in the form of an effective field theory (EFT): such anEFT is known as Chiral Perturbation Theory, and is a perturbative expansion in the light quark masses and small momenta/energies. In addition, QCD has an expansion in 1/Nc, where Nc is the number of color dgrees of freedom, Nc=3 in nature. Observable quantities in QCD can also be expanded in powers of 1/Nc. The project has combined the Chiral and 1/Nc expansion for baryons, more specifically light non-strange baryons, developing the theoretical framework for a linked perturbative expansion known as the xi expansion (BChPT x 1/Nc). Consistency with the large Nc limit requires the effective theory to have an approximate spin-flavor symmetry, which automatically implies that not only nucleons but also the Delta resonances must be included as degrees of freedom. For different observables and processes various pieces of the EFT need to be developed.\r\n\n\nThe focus of the present project has been on the study of pion-nucleon scattering, which is the most important process for understanding chiral dynamics at low energies involving baryons, and also on the study of asymmetries in electron scattering on polarized nucleons.\r\n\n\nThe project on pion-nucleon scattering implemented the xi expansion to the second subleading order. As in previous studies of other observables, the effective theory shows an improvement in the behavior of the higher order corrections, which are tamed by the underlying spin-flavor symmetry, and it also an extension in the range of applicability that includes the energy of excitation of the Delta resonance. The study has been completed by analyzing the pion-nucleon scattering database SAID, and very low energy results from pionic-atoms experiments. This project has been part of the PhD thesis of Hampton University graduate student Dulitha Jayakodige, who is graduating in December 2024.\r\n\n\nThe study of single spin asymmetries in electron-nucleon scattering developed a framework based on the 1/Nc expansion that can reliably describe the SSAs in the low energy regime extending up to the excitation of the Delta resonance. The SSA in that regime depends on the various electromagnetic couplings and form factors involving nucleons and Delta resonances. Since not all of them are known, the spin-flavor symmetry provides the missing information in terms of the known ones, and thus a fully predictive theoretical framework has been developed. The study of SSAs is also motivated by the fact that no experiments have been carried out in the mentioned regime of energy.\r\n\n\nThe projects have advanced the implementation of new methods for studying processes in low energy baryon physics. In the two areas addressed in the project, further studies are possible making use of the well defined EFT theoretical frameworks developed as part of this NSF award.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JoseLGoity\n"
