 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a quantitative tool to detect cancer in single cells for a wide range of clinical and research applications. Currently, there is no technology available for detecting cancer in single cells. Exogenous fluorescence polarization technology comprises of the device and method(s) that can be implemented in clinical practice, translational and cancer biology research. In a clinical setting, it has significant potential to enable early stage cancer detection before diagnosis is possible by other current means, as well as accurate intraoperative inspection for excision margins.  In cancer biology research, this technology will facilitate investigation of the early stages of cancer progression in animal models. In translational research, it will be useful for evaluation of the efficacy of novel cancer drugs and treatment protocols. Because of low cost, robustness and simplicity, exogenous fluorescence polarization technology can potentially be rapidly implemented, commercialized and adopted by both clinical practitioners and translational researchers.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of utilizing fluorescence polarization of methylene blue for detecting cancer in single cells. Exogenous fluorescence polarization is a real time, quantitative and sensitive technology that can be realized in vivo and ex vivo. It is an intrinsically ratiometric technique that does not rely on absolute measurements of fluorescence intensity and, depending on the customer requirements, can be implemented in a spectroscopic and imaging modes. It has been demonstrated that higher fluorescence polarization of methylene blue occurs due to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of cancer cells, as well as shorter fluorescence lifetime in cancer relative to normal cells. The results obtained at both macroscopic level in tissues and microscopic level in cells for breast, brain, skin and kidney cancers indicate that the technology successfully discriminates cancer with high statistical significance. Therefore, methylene blue fluorescence polarization imaging / spectroscopy holds the potential to provide an accurate quantitative marker of cancer at the cellular and tissue level.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
