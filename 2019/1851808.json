 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the role of firms, labor markets, and government institutions in determining earnings inequality and volatility is key to addressing employment challenges in the modern U.S. economy. A comprehensive analysis of this issue has been hindered by the lack of data linking firms, workers, and labor markets over time. This project will use the universe of linked corporate and household tax filings from the U.S. to examine firms, value added, workers, earnings, households, income, and the governments' tax receipts and transfers. The project will address questions on how government policies may affect inequality and uncertainty in the economy. The project will further deliver aggregate statistics on these measures, which will serve the broader community by providing input to relevant policy issues and research.\r\n\r\nUsing detailed data and new statistical methods, the project will decompose earnings inequality into the components due to (i) worker differences in skill levels, (ii) firm differences in pay for the same skill level, (iii) the sorting of high-skilled workers into high-paying firms, (iv) the productivity complementarities arising from firm-worker matches, and (v) the pass-through of firm productivity shocks. Then, the project will derive and estimate a structural model of labor market monopsony that is consistent with empirical findings and use the model to address questions on the impact of government decisions on inequality and volatility. The project will further examine how labor markets differ between the U.S. and Europe. Also, by utilizing procurement auction data, the project will measure the rate at which demand shocks are passed through to workers by their employers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We found that most of the inequality in earnings is explained by heterogeneity in the skill of the workers. Firms explain only a few percent of overall earnings inequality. A substantial share of the inequality in earnings is due to positive sorting of more-skilled workers to higher-paying firms. Our preferred estimates suggest a correlation between worker skill and firm pay of about 0.4. The relative gains in earnings from moving to higher-paying firms are considerably larger for more-skilled workers. These positive interaction effects are especially pronounced at the upper tails of the distributions of worker skill and firm pay. Furthermore, idiosyncratic productivity shocks to a firm transmit significantly to the earnings of its employees. We estimate that a 10 percent increase in the value added of a firm due to a productivity shock leads to a 1.4 percent increase in the earnings of that firm's incumbent workers. The earnings of incumbent workers respond less to a shock to the current employer than to a (same size) shock to all firms in the same industry and location.

The empirical context was the U.S. construction industry, where we leveraged demand shocks from bidding in procurement auctions to infer wage-setting power. We found that firms have significant wage-setting power, with an estimated firm-specific labor supply elasticity of about 4. The estimate indicates that, if an American construction firm aims to increase the number of employees by 10 percent, it needs to increase wages by more than 2 percent. Wages are marked down 20 percent relative to the marginal revenue product of labor. Further analyses suggest that the incentives of firms to mark down wages and reduce employment due to wage-setting power are attenuated by their price-setting power in the product market. Workers are, on average, willing to pay 20 percent of their wage to stay in their current firms. Comparing these worker rents to those earned by firms suggests that more than three-fourths of the total rents are captured by firms. Additional rents are generated at the margin when a procurement contract is awarded to a firm.
