 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to purchase and install a confocal Raman microscope (CRM) at the University of Georgia's Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO). Many of the research problems in marine science involve the study of small particles and organisms. Most current methods for studying small samples require grouping large numbers of individual particles together to obtain enough material for analysis. Pooling samples can obscure critical details of the diversity of particle composition and structure within them. The CRM can obtain chemical compositional data for individual particles smaller than a micron in size, and it can automatically map sample composition over much larger scales in fine detail. The capacity to image both organic and inorganic chemical structure has direct application to the fields of marine microbiology, chemistry, ecology and geology. The presence of a CRM at a southeastern coastal laboratory will allow regional scientists to address new research questions in ocean science. The new analytical capabilities will directly improve the funded activities of 75% of SkIO?s faculty in addition to external, collaborating scientists from the southeastern US and beyond. Additionally, the highly visual output of the CRM will allow educators, citizen-scientists, and the public to better understand the research conducted at SkIO and by visiting scientists.\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks funds for the acquisition of a Horiba Jobin Yvon XploRA PLUS Confocal Raman microscope, equipped with 532 nm and 785 nm lasers, motorized and software-controlled XYZ sample stage, an integrated safety shield, and associated autofocus, calibration, particle mapping, chemical identification and statistical analysis software and uninterruptible power supply. The requested instrument will add significant, high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic capability to an existing particle counting and image analysis facility in the coastal Southeastern US, as well as be synergistic with existing trace element, stable isotope, and conventional light microscopy facilities located at the University of Georgia Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO). The proposed instrument will allow sub-micron chemical characterization, particle mapping, and quantification of complex samples from a wide array of projects and fill an analytical and scientific gap in the region. The requested instrument will allow on-location, low-cost analysis of samples from existing and future projects in several critical areas of marine research, both local and regional. It also will enhance educational opportunities for several established, collaborative, and upcoming programs at SkIO, many of which target under-represented groups. Finally, it will provide highly visual data which is invaluable for educational and outreach efforts. For more information about SkIO, please visit their website at https://www.skio.uga.edu/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
