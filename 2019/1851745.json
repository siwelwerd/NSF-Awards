 "awd_abstract_narration": "Disparities in outcomes across social groups are found in nearly every domain of modern human society, including education, the labor market, and healthcare. Whether on the basis of gender, ethnicity, age or other markers, group-based differences in how people treat others are known to arise even when social group information is irrelevant and even when people explicitly reject social stereotypes. Despite progress in documenting these disparities, much remains unknown about their origins. The current research focuses on the role of individual human decision-making in producing societal-level outcomes. Specifically, the investigators aim to leverage complementary strengths of behavioral economics, social psychology, and cognitive neuroscience to uncover systematic patterns of individual human decision-making that, in aggregate, contribute to societal treatment disparities. The primary goal is to characterize the origins of unequal treatment with sufficient precision to support accurate, context-specific predictions of how people will treat members of different social groups. Support for this collaborative effort broadens access to training opportunities for aspiring scientists, provides opportunities for scientific outreach to local communities, and ultimately contributes scientific understanding of societal disparities, with implications for efforts to measure and address discrimination.\r\n\r\nSubstantial progress has been made in documenting the existence of treatment disparities in the world. Separately, substantial progress has been made in in understanding how people think about different social groups in the laboratory. However, given the multitude of ways in which people can be categorized, and the complexity of factors influencing people's social behavior, it has been challenging to construct models of social thought and behavior that are capable of linking laboratory insights to field observations. The current research aims to connect these efforts to produce accurate predictions about when and how members of particular groups will be (dis)advantaged. Specifically, building upon evidence from cognitive neuroscience that valuation and social cognition engage separable but interacting systems, the research uses computational modeling to formally integrate psychological frameworks of how people see others (social perception) with behavioral economic accounts of how people value others' outcomes (social valuation). It then uses those models to predict how people will treat members of different social groups in laboratory and field settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Warmth is the perception of the goodness or malice of a person's intentions, while competence is a perception of the person&rsquo;s perceived ability to act on those intentions. We investigated two aspects of judgments of warmth and competence (W&amp;C) about different groups of people.</p>\n<p>First, are W&amp;C judgments associated with success in the labor market? To find out, we relied on previous experimental ``correspondence studies. In these studies, experimenters send pairs of fictitious resumes to employers. The pair is the same in every way (skills, education, etc.)s&mdash;except for one varying factor. For example if gender is varied the two first names in the pair might be Christopher and Christina. The outcome variable is whether job candidates get a callback from a potential employer for an interview. Comparing callbacks for Christopher and Christina measures whether there is gender discrimination.</p>\n<p>We re-analyzed data from 8 large studies which reported the exact names they used. The intellectual merit of our approach was to ask Prolific online people to rate the W&amp;C associated with the names (nobody had done this before with so many different studies). Then we tested whether callback rates were influenced by W&amp;C. The first attached image shows that callbacks <em>were</em> influenced by W&amp;C: The forest plot depicted in the image shows the correlation between callback rates and a combination of W&amp;C. (The lines are intervals of confidence around the range of possible correlations. If these intervals are too wide we can&rsquo;t be too sure what the correlation really is.) Some studies showed zero correlation (at the top) but the overall correlation, the vertical blue line, was at r=.33.</p>\n<p>The broader impact of our findings is that W&amp;C clearly appear to influence hiring decisions for race and gender. For some jobs, these traits may be <em>bona fide</em> necessary skills; but for others they may reflect bias and poor hiring practices. Integrating W&amp;C measures into HR practices could assist recruiters in making fairer and better hiring decisions. Knowing that they are being judged implicitly on W&amp;C can also lead to ways to help people in job or housing markets appear more attractive; that is a big help for introverts or other groups who are stereotypically judged as low-warmth.</p>\n<p>Another broader impact comes from analysis of other categories which we studied from correspondence data. These include parental status, sexuality, age, and disability. In general, there is no reliable correlation between W&amp;C and hiring across these categorical differences. Some studies found a negative parenting penalty in the effect of W&amp;C on callback, and some found a positive boost. There is a big scientific opportunity to design better, more conclusive studies about many of these traits, particularly those which are legally protected from discrimination (such as age and disability.</p>\n<p>The second aspect we studies is whether AI algorithms reflect stereotypes about W&amp;C and demographics? (This is generally called algorithmic bias in AI and is a hugely important topic for many practical purposes.) To do this, we entered text prompts based on verbal dimensions of warmth (such as friendliness and sincerity) and competence (such as intelligence and skill). These language prompts were then associated with sets of faces which vary by race, gender, and age. A recent AI method called CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) then measures how similar a text embedding is to features of visual images. The closeness is a measure called cosine similarity. The intellectual merit is trying to tie the social perception words (which we know people use to decide callbacks from our first study) to different types of faces, varying by age, gender and race.</p>\n<p>The attached image shows how verbal stereotype words with negative valence (e.g. low warmth) or positive valence (e.g., high competence) are associated, by CLIP, with faces reflecting different demographics. There are six combinations of gender and race (White, Black, Asian). For each combination there are 10 points corresponding to different age categories. The CLIP method, applied to CausalFace data set, generates the tightest clusters around the 10 age points in each of the six groups (shown by ellipses).</p>\n<p>There are two broader impacts of using AI. One impact is that it is much easier to study combinations of social categories, as illustrated in the image, which would require sending out huge samples of resumes in a typical correspondence study experiment (if the goal is to see how six race-gender intersecting categories, for example, are evaluated by employers). AI methods like ours will revolutionize applications of social psychology. The second impact is that if an algorithmic bias is detected (to use the AI term) it is often feasible to tune the algorithms to eliminate the bias.
