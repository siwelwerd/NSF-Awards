 "awd_abstract_narration": "In imaging applications related to earth and environmental monitoring, manufacturing industries, medical studies and many others, collected image data are often in the form of data streams in the sense that new images are acquired sequentially over time. In such applications, one fundamental task is to monitor the image sequence to see whether the underlying longitudinal process of the observed images changes significantly over time. This project aims to develop novel and effective statistical methods for answering this question. Because of the wide applications of image sequence monitoring, this project will have broader impacts on society through its applications in different disciplines and areas. Open source R packages will be developed and distributed freely for convenient use by practitioners. A web portal will also be developed for individual researchers to try the proposed methods. The PI plans to integrate the research results into educational activities, including the development of new curriculum modules, the mentoring of Ph.D. students, and outreach to local high schools students for after-school activities to raise their interests in data modeling and scientific research, and contribute to the workforce development in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop a flexible longitudinal modeling approach and an effective sequential monitoring scheme for analyzing image data streams, and study their statistical properties. The proposed longitudinal model for describing observed images in a given time interval is flexible, and its estimation procedure has the edge-preservation property while removing noise. It can accommodate both geometric misalignments among observed images and spatio-temporal data correlation in the observed image data. The proposed image monitoring approach can account for dynamic longitudinal patterns of the observed image data streams. To this end, image pre-processing, including image denoising and image registration, will be performed properly before image monitoring. The proposed methods will consider both cases where the observation times are equally or unequally spaced.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
