 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project acquires a high-mix, low volume printed circuit board (PCB) assembly system optimized for a research prototyping environment.  This assembly system forms the basis for a new core facility that will be available to the university community and its partners, accelerating advancement in underwater networking, autonomous imaging, robotics, renewable energy, ubiquitous computing, and other areas. It enhances an existing undergraduate course in electronics and a graduate course in embedded design. It not only serves as a valuable prototyping tool in each course, but provides the foundation for introducing design for manufacturing into the curriculum. Hence, the system contributes to educating the next generation of scientists and engineers who will support entrepreneurial activities in South Florida.\r\n\r\nThe instrument supports industry-sponsored research projects that include: the design, implementation, and evaluation of a low-cost, high-fidelity, wireless sensing system for monitoring carbon dioxide concentrations for demand-controlled ventilation; and a wireless system for monitoring pressure transients and forecasting leaks in municipal water distribution systems. The work involves research efforts that include, among others, underwater networking, water-sensing analysis, marine renewable energy. The assembly system supports the design, implementation, and evaluation of:\r\n- A practical solution for underwater localization and communication;\r\n- A new approach to GPS-free localization and navigation; \r\n- An autonomous optical and acoustic system for underwater imaging detection and classification;\r\n- An autonomous aerial/terrestrial/water robotics platform for large-scale monitoring of aquaculture fisheries; \r\n- A new hardware platform for battery-free sensing under dynamic load and energy from ocean currents.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
