 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups historically under-represented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  The Promotion of Underrepresented Minorities in Academic STEM (PUMA-STEM) alliance, under the leadership of Elmhurst College, is a STEM Pathways and Implementation-Only (SPIO) alliance in partnership with Benedictine University, Concordia University Chicago, Dominican University, Lewis University, North Central College, Saint Xavier University and the College of DuPage.  Participating institutions are also Hispanic-Serving or emerging Hispanic-Serving.  All institutions are predominantly undergraduate institutions (PUIs). It is hypothesized that an alliance of small PUIs can successfully increase recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority students in STEM fields by developing a committed regional network of institutions working together to develop support programs and build communities thus becoming a model for replication to other institutions.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the alliance is to double the number of historically underrepresented minority students completing baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields.  To achieve its goals, the alliance will implement interventions such as faculty and peer mentoring, high-quality research experiences (including opportunities for community college students transferring to four year schools) and programs to promote inclusive experiences and a sense of belonging in STEM fields. Project results will be disseminated to other colleges and universities, including community colleges, especially those with largely commuter, Hispanic or other underrepresented minority student populations. Effective dissemination will be aided via collaboration with the Louis Stokes Midwest Regional Center of Excellence (LSMRCE), which offers annual meetings attended by other alliances as well as dissemination through the alliance website, scholarly publications and professional conferences on teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
