 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solar cells can convert sunlight into electricity, providing a clean and renewable energy source. This is of very high priority given the continually diminishing resources and rising prices of fossil fuels and degrading global environment from fossil fuel burning.  The project addresses fundamental understanding and improvement of the stability of perovskite solar cells, a strong candidate important for a renewable and environmentally friendly energy source. It can be expected that the research activities will result in new device structures and performance enhancements of perovskite solar cells.  Efforts will be made to bring science and technology to real products that impact the society.  A major part of the program will be educating and training graduate and undergraduate students through interdisciplinary research in advanced materials and devices and in materials surface/interface characterization. A strong focus of the program is on increasing participation of scientific research by under-represented minorities as well as women at all levels and providing early exposure of research to middle and high school students through programs at University of Rochester and University of North Carolina.  Perovskite solar cell demonstration kits will be developed for high school students, and presentations to the community at large to show the usefulness of perovskite solar cells.\r\n\r\nTechnical: There have been unexpected breakthroughs and rapid evolution in organometal trihalide perovskite materials for high-performance optoelectronic devices.  Although the power efficiency of hybrid perovskite solar cells has already reached over 23% in the laboratory, the stability of the materials remains a critical issue.  The goal of the project is to study the stability of organometal trihalide perovskites using surface analytical techniques, to resolve the fundamental issues and challenges regarding the stability of these materials, and to improve the stability through materials synthesis and interface engineering.  The surface analytical techniques include, but are not limited to, angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, inverse photoemission spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The scope and approaches of the research include: 1) the stability and degradation mechanisms of different organometal trihalide perovskites, including the effects of environmental factors, light illumination, and device operation;  2) the stability improvement of the interfaces, including minimizing interface reaction, ion migration, and providing protection of the perovskites from environmental detrimental factors; 3) the passivation and stabilization of grain boundaries, including neutralizing charge trapping defects and minimizing impurity migration along the grain boundaries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The attributes of these devices are very promising and attractive. However, the stability of these devices is still a critical issue. In this project, surface analytical studies are carried out on the degradation processes of perovskites. The factors that limit the stability of the perovskites are investigated quantitatively and systematically using surface/interface sensitive experimental techniques, and the relationship between the electronic structure and composition changes of the perovskite surface is revealed. Significant outcome includes training graduate undergraduate and graduate students working on fields related to renewable energy, and generating important knowledge on solar energy devices that leads to the publication of 38 papers in scientific journals, 2 invited reviews, and an invited book chapter. There are also 10 presentations at international conferences, including 6 invited talks. The main findings include:\n\n\n1) X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) study reveals that the light and oxygen-induced degradation process of perovskite MAPbBr3 single crystal is substantially accelerated compared with that of oxygen-only and light-only exposure. The crystal surface is roughened and transformed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation provides a detailed microscopic explanation of the experimental observation.\n\n\n2) During thermal deposition of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3),one of the prototypical perovskite solar cell materials, methylammonium iodide (MAI) and PbI2behaved very differently. MAI evaporates dissociatively as CH3NH2and HI, in contrast to PbI2that evaporates as a whole compound. It is also observed that CH3NH2reacts with water vapor during evaporation, and deduced the thermal dynamic process and energy balance.\n\n\n3) It is found that with capsaicin modification, defect density of the perovskite solar cell is reduced. After capsaicin modification, the efficiency of the devices increases from 19.90% to 21.87 % with a champion device of 22.24%. XPS and theoretical calculation indicate that the reduced trap density is due to the chemical interaction between carbonyl group (from capsaicin) and Sn atom, and that between carbonyl group and Pb atom.\n\n\n4) Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) is found to effectively protect the perovskite surface against moisture. In a CuPc-passivated sample, the surface had no oxygen signals after the total 1013 langmuir (L) of water exposure, while the pristine sample started to see non-neglectable oxygen component at 105 L. It is found that forming a dense and hydrophobic layer is the key for the protection.\n\n\n5) It is found that incorporating Cs could function as stabilizers to efficiently interrupt such a synergistic effect between oxygen induced degradation and ion migration while retaining the high performance of perovskite solar cells. Both experimental and theoretical results suggest that 5% Cs+ions incorporation simultaneously suppresses the formation of reactive superoxide ions (O2) as well as ion migration in perovskites by forming additional energy barriers.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/24/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: YongliGao\n"
