If the agents make their decisions dynamically, in an uncertain environment, the outcome of such interactions can be conveniently described by a continuum-player stochastic dynamic game.  The investigator pursues several research directions, unified by the idea of establishing the game-theoretic models, which on the one hand capture the real-world phenomena with sufficient precision, and on the other hand allow for tractable representations of the equilibria.  Such models can be used to establish quantitative results, i.e., to make predictions about the future evolution of a system, or to optimize the rules of interaction in the system.  The study of such classes of games is motivated by various applications.  As particular cases, the investigator considers models arising in market microstructure and systemic risk.  The results of the project can be used for predicting the potential instabilities in financial markets and for designing effective regulatory policies for financial exchanges and banking systems.  In addition, the class of systems analyzed in this project includes other relevant models in economics, neuroscience, and sociology, resulting in a large array of potential applications that may benefit society.  The educational component of the project includes designing teaching materials, for both undergraduate and graduate students, with stronger emphasis on the novel applications of mathematics to problems of finance and economics.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project.\r\n\r\n     While there are many abstract mathematical results for constructing equilibria in dynamic stochastic games, these results rely on assumptions that often are incompatible with realistic models.  The investigator considers several classes of large-population games that naturally fail to satisfy the standard assumptions, either due to the presence of stopping times in the agents' strategies, or because of the singular type of interactions between the agents.  In both cases, the standard fixed-point results cannot be applied directly to construct an equilibrium, due to the lack of required continuity or monotonicity properties.  The investigator studies several methods to overcome these difficulties, which lead to mathematical problems interesting in their own right.  This study contributes to the theory of continuum-player games (including, but not limited to, mean field games), optimal stochastic control, and the propagation of chaos.  In particular, this project addresses specific problems in the theory of backward stochastic differential equations with oblique reflection, as well as the questions of limiting behavior of particle systems with singular interaction through hitting times.  The results of this analysis provide new tools for equilibrium-based modeling.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project.",

The game-theoretic models for market microstructure developed by the PI and his collaborators contribute to better understanding and prediction of price impact (i.e., by how much a purchase or a sale of the asset moves its market price). In particular, the PI managed to find a precise mathematical explanation of the (empirically observed) concavity of price impact via the U-shaped distribution of the volume imbalance (a graph is attached). Another contribution in this direction, by the PI and his collaborators, is the development of rigorous numerical methods for the computation of equilibrium prices of financial derivatives and of the optimal brokerage contracts in the presence of price impact. Some of the market microstructure models developed by the PI connect naturally to Reflected Backward Stochastic Differential Equations. The projects of this award have, therefore, contributed to the study of such equations, including novel well-posedness results and connections to Stochastic Geometry.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">2. The investigation of particle systems with singular interaction through hitting times was initiated in order to model the dynamics of a large lending-borrowing network, with a focus on how the losses from defaults propagate therein. The PI and his collaborators have established the large-population behavior of such a system (including a characterization of the times of systemic crises) in the case where the borrowing and lending connections are given exogenously. In addition, they have characterized equilibria in a version of such a model where the connections are established strategically by the participants. Similar particle systems (with singular interaction through hitting times) are used in Computational Neuroscience in order to model the interaction between neuron cells. The PI and his collaborator have extended the existing models to cover the case of heterogeneous neurons, which may be both inhibitory and excitotary, and have characterized the large-population behavior of the associated system.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The large-population dynamics of particle systems referred to in the above paragraph are described by a partial differential equation (PDE), which, after a change of variables, turns into the notorious Stefan equation. The latter PDE describes the process of transitioning between the solid (e.g., ice) and the liquid (water) phases, and vice versa. This equation serves as a building block in many mathematical models of fundamental physical processes, including melting/solidification, crystal growth, aging of alloys, etc. Under many natural circumstances (e.g., if the effect of surface tension is non-negligible), the solution to Stefan equation exhibits supercooling, which means that the temperature in the liquid phase drops below its equilibrium freezing level without the liquid freezing immediately. It has been known for over 50 years that the solutions of Stefan equations with supercooling possess singularities which, in particular, force them to jump along the time variable. The existing notions of solutions, until recently, did not allow to describe such jumps and to pin down the solution to Stefan equation uniquely, in the presence of supercooling. The PI and his collaborators were the first ones to propose the notion of probabilistic solution, which allowed them to prove both existence and uniqueness of solution to Stefan equation with supercooling. This was first established for a single-phase Stefan problem in spacial dimension one, and then extended to the two-phase problem in multiple dimension under radial symmetry. In the course of this investigation, the PI and his collaborators have also established novel results on the large-population behavior of the external Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) model.
