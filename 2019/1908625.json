 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interstellar space is not empty. The space between stars teams with gas atoms, molecules, and tiny solid particles and is threaded by vast magnetic fields. The investigators will determine the properties of these particles and molecules and how they interact with those magnetic fields. The components of interstellar space play a key role in how stars and planets form, but relevant astronomical observations are scarce. This research will use a unique infrared camera on the largest optical telescope to look at a special type of molecule called a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). A PAH efficiently absorbs ultraviolet light and re-emits that energy in the form of infrared light. The polarization (vibration direction) of that light will be measured, thereby telling scientists how tightly, if at all, these PAHs are gripped by the magnetic field. That measurement is also a valuable clue to the detailed properties of the PAH molecules, such as size and electric charge. Their observations will provide a more complete picture of the contents of interstellar space, since PAHs contain a large fraction of all the carbon in space.\r\n\r\nThe investigator will also observe the magnetic field in the intense burst of star formation occurring in the core of a nearby galaxy. This image will reveal how the magnetic fields, huge molecular clouds, and hundreds of supernova interact across that unusual region. Their observations will thereby provide clues to the origin and changes with time of one of the Universe's most dramatic occurrences, a super-starburst in a galaxy. \r\n\r\nThrough the University of Florida's remote observing facility, many graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of this research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

They are invisible and yet their forces play a crucial role in shaping the universe, particularly in regions of star formation. Using a powerful infrared-sensitive camera on the largest optical telescope in the world, the Gran Telescopio Canarias located in Spain's Canary Islands, the proposer and his team have explored the structure of magnetic fields in regions of star formation and probed the properties of their interstellar dust, solid particles that permeate space. The infrared camera, named CanariCam, can detect polarized infrared light that is absorbed or emitted by needle-like dust particles. Like compass needles, these particles align themselves in a magnetic field, which leaves an imprint on the polarization detected by CanariCam and can be used to trace out the field's large-scale shape. A unique advantage of observing at \"mid-infrared\" wavelengths, where silicate particles are prominent emitters and absorbers, is that the polarization resulting from background emission and foreground absorption along the same line of sight can be disentangled and, as in tomography, a three-dimensional picture of the magnetic-field shape can be constructed, a novel technique that we have profitably exploited.</p>\n<p>We have expanded our previous NSF-funded research by exploring the magnetic fields in multiple select star-forming regions, one of which is the well-known nebula W51-IRS2. Polarization images (Figure 1, top) of this region show smoothly varying polarization across the field of view. However, to make sense of it, we must separate the polarization associated with emission from the heated warm dust near the stars from the polarization arising from absorption of the foreground cocoon between us and the emission. Doing that (Figure 1, middle and bottom) reveals that the magnetic field aligning the particles in the bright background emitting region (Figure 1, bottom right) follows the path of rapidly outflowing gas (i.e., gas originating from within the bright arc of emission) as it is heated by the young star that is buried in, but near the edge of, the molecular cloud. That expanding gas is bursting through the surface of the cloud like a \"champagne flow\" when the cork is popped. We see the outflowing gas near the outflow base near the star is strong enough to bend the pre-existing magnetic field until the gas merges with the more extended material and the surrounding magnetic field. Figure 2 is a direct comparison of the magnetic field lines inferred from the polarization to the hot, outflowing ionized gas as traced by the radio emission.
