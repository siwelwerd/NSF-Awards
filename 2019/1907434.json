 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algae has been identified as one of the most promising sources of energy for biodiesel production. However, current algae cultivation techniques are inefficient and costly, which limits its scalability to meaningful production levels. In nature, coral reefs stand among the most productive ecosystems, powered by the high photosynthetic efficiency of the coral-algae symbiosis. But algae self-shading is currently a key limiting factor prohibiting expansion of commercial algae cultivation. The goal of this project is to investigate a novel manufacturing method to produce engineered corals with biomimetic light management strategies to cultivate living algae towards scalable algae-based biofuel manufacturing. If successful, this research will lay the foundation for rapid three-dimensional bioprinting of coral tissues. This work will define a new class of bionic materials capable of interacting with living organisms. The high spatial efficiency of the bionic coral system in three dimensions is particularly suitable for the design of compact bioreactors for algae growth in dense urban areas or as life support systems for space travel. Therefore, this research will have transformative impact to diverse sectors including advanced manufacturing and biofuel production, and directly impacts the economic welfare and national security of the United States. In education and outreach, the project will offer exciting interdisciplinary training that integrates contents from nanomaterials, biomaterials, to biomanufacturing. A diverse group of students, especially women and minority students at graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 levels will be trained in this project.\r\n\r\nThe research objective of the project is to understand how material composition and structure design affect the manufacture of the biomimetic coral construct and the proliferation of algae cells on the coral scaffold. To achieve this objective, a rapid 3D bioprinting method will be employed to manufacture optically-tunable scaffolds with nature inspired geometry to mimic coral tissue with microscale precision to cultivate algae. Analytical analysis will be carried out to simulate light propagation mechanism in the coral scaffolds. These simulation results will guide the design and 3D bioprinting process. Experiments will be conducted to study the mechanical, chemical, and biological properties of the biomimetic coral structure. This will be the first attempt in the field to use 3D bioprinting for algae biofuel manufacturing, therefore it will be high risk. But if successful, this work will transform the field of biofuel research and manufacturing. The PI is a pioneer in 3D bioprinting with an outstanding track record of research publications in the areas of 3D bioprinting, biomaterials, and nanophotonics. His laboratory and institution have excellent resources and facilities to support this work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
