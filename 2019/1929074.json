 "awd_abstract_narration": "While flooding is a complex process involving both meteorological systems and surface conditions, most high-impact events are characterized by high rainfall totals.  This study focuses on understanding storm systems that deliver high rainfall amounts over the West African Sahel, a relatively remote region known to be particularly vulnerable to flooding due to the frequent occurrence of intense rainfall and relatively low adaptive capacity.  The overarching goal is to advance our physical understanding of the development of extreme rainfall-producing systems over the West African Sahel by investigating how environmental conditions contribute the development of such storms.  Given the consequences of high-impact rainfall events for the livelihoods of West Africans, as well as the known role of these systems over the West African Sahel in Atlantic hurricanes, the knowledge gained from this study will be valuable for improving not only the prediction of high-impact rainfall events over the West African Sahel but also the weather forecast for our own national interests. The project also contributes to the education of the next generation of atmospheric scientists through involving and training a post-doctoral researcher and a graduate student as well as through a K-12 outreach program. \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of this project are: (1) to understand the characteristics of precipitating systems that deliver high-impact rainfall amounts; and (2) to determine the set of environmental conditions that favor the development of these rainfall events. These objectives will be addressed by utilizing high-resolution satellite-derived rainfall products, state-of-the-art atmospheric reanalysis data, along with convection-permitting regional climate modeling.  Satellite-derived rainfall estimates and ground-based observations will be used to identify and characterize high-impact rainfall events over the region, and these will be cross-referenced with ground-truth to identify events associated with reported flooding.  Atmospheric reanalysis data and convection-permitting modeling will be used to identify the environmental conditions associated with intense storms, and to develop and test hypotheses regarding how they are related to deepen our understanding of the physical processes associated with the development of high-impact rainfall events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, with the exception of clear sky flooding associated with sea level rise, these high-impact events are accompanied by high rainfall totals in the watershed. The goal of this study was to advance our understanding of high-impact rainfall systems that deliver high rainfall amounts over the West African Sahel, including their interactions with large-scale environmental conditions. Such an understanding is crucial to improve our ability to better predict these high-impact rainfall systems which cause catastrophic flooding and the loss of life over this particularly vulnerable region of West Africa.\n\n\nThis project identified that the most extreme rainfall events tend to be clustered in specific areas over the southern Sahel of West Africa. Further we show that southwestern Mali is a favorable location for extreme rainfall over the West African Sahel due to the confluence of three factors, namely, critical proximity to both the Atlantic Ocean and the Saharan heat low, and the presence of summer southern storm track for African easterly wave disturbances. Specific circulation and atmospheric moisture patterns are identified as being associated with extreme rainfall over southwestern Mali. Multiple environmental factors were examined to understand their relative importance. We showed that a significant increase in atmospheric moisture content precedes the development of most extreme storms, but there is no evidence of significant changes in the low to mid-level vertical wind shear indicating that changes in vertical shear were less influential in extreme storm development than atmospheric moisture preconditioning. We also show that while there is a positive relationship between extreme rainfall and the build-up of atmospheric moisture prior to the event, environmental convective available potential energy is not necessarily a good predictor of extreme rainfall. Rather flow interactions with terrain features and air mass boundaries are important factors to consider for the development of high rainfall rates. We also demonstrated that Lake Chad, located in the central Sahel, is not acting as a major regional moisture source for West African convection. Rather, the lakes regional impact operates dynamically though its influence on the surface temperature gradients near the lake. Convective permitting modeling was used to understand the roles of thermodynamic and dynamic processes in changing storm intensity over the West African Sahel due to global warming. While the low- to mid-level vertical wind shear increases in the future, no significant correlations between the environmental shear strength and peak storm rainfall rates are found. Rather, lower (middle) tropospheric moisture and temperature are correlated (anticorrelated) with peak rainfall rates and maximum updraft velocity. Thus, results indicate that thermodynamic and not dynamical (shear-related) processes likely will dominate future rainfall intensification.\n\n\nThe broader impact of this work is that the knowledge gained has provided a better understanding of how local and regional environmental factors interact to influence the development of high-impact rainfall events. It also advanced our understanding of the extent to which high-impact rainfall events can be accurately simulated using high-resolution convection permitting modeling. This basic knowledge is beneficial to both the weather/climate forecasting and model development communities. Outcomes have been disseminated to the public through 5 peer-reviewed publications and formal presentations at scientific conferences. The project supported the mentorship of a post-doc briefly and a graduate student for most of her PhD candidacy. Activities related to this project were incorporated in a climate modeling course taught at UT Austin.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/06/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: EdwardKVizy\n"
