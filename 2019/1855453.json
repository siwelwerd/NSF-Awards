 "awd_abstract_narration": "There have been many hurricanes over the past few years that have made landfall or severely impacted the east/southeast coast of United States. Data from such hurricanes that impacts the terrestrial water cycle such as flooding - standing water on different land surface types is often poor. The project will collect three different kinds of observations - citizens mapping the flood extend, use of unmanned aerial vehicles to image flooded areas and the water quality samples for surface and groundwater in these areas in eastern North Carolina. These data will be collected over different land use types such as agriculture, urban, suburban and barrier islands. These data will be used in later studies to understand the behavior of flow and storage in the aftermath of record setting precipitation following a hurricane and to relay this information to the society.\r\n\r\nFlood inundation models face a problem of lack of data for calibration and validation. Models for flooding are distributed and yet traditional hydrology often collects only lumped data - discharge at a few points in the stream channel in the catchment and at the outlet. This is not sufficient to characterize the spatial response of a watershed. By collection of flood inundation data after Hurricane Florence of standing water using citizen mapping, use of unmanned aerial vehicles and water quality samples, the PI and his team will be able to generate a data set that can be used later for answering important science questions on water shed hydrology during floods. These questions include - how accurate are our flood hydrology models for a watershed; what is the response time for landscapes to recover from floods and does this vary among different land use type and lastly can we change the land use management to minimize the impact of floods. These questions can be adequately answered by the data collected in this RAPID project. The collection of water quality data feeds to the last question as to the land management strategies for minimizing impact of floods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project investigated the impacts of Hurricane Florence on the Tar, Neuse, and Cape Fear watersheds in North Carolina.  Hurricane Florence was a record setting event, causing high flows and catastrophic floods throughout the region - particularly in the Neuse and Cape Fear watersheds.  Water samples were collected from all three watersheds following the hurricane and analyzed for a variety of constituents.  Isotopic analysis of the water samples showed that the majority of runoff from the hurricane discharged from the basins within about two weeks after landfall occurred.  Some flow appeared to take a longer pathway through the watershed where it picked up ammonium, phosphate, and organic carbon along the way.  These constituents at times continued to discharge at high levels for up to a month after landfall.  Other constituents, such as chloride and nitrate, tended to be diluted by the high flows produced by the hurricane and decreased in concentration.  This behavior indicates that these constituents are likely contributed to the rivers by groundwater discharge.  Overall, the water quality data shed light on different sources and pathways of flow through the watershed, which is an important factor needed to understand how future extreme rainfall events are likely to impact the region.  In addition to the water quality analysis, aerial imagery of flooded regions was collected using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).  These data were used to validate models of flood inundation.  We found that simple flood modeling techniques provide the best results as long as high-quality digital elevation models are used to estimate topography.  Finally, photographs of impacts of the hurricane were collected from throughout the region and a student film was produced sharing personal reflections on how the hurricane impacted the people of eastern North Carolina.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/05/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen M Moysey"
