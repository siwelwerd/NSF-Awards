 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project include the ability to meet the requirements of cable infrastructure while opening additional markets in spectrum allocation by solving key technical problems. There is a massive need for improved connectivity for both fixed and mobile applications, in both urban and rural communities, within the nation. Wired infrastructure has struggled to keep up with the needs of users due to the large capital involved in deploying fiber to communities. Additionally, new applications like Internet of Things (IoT) and autonomous vehicles are entirely reliant on wireless technologies. Mobile data usage has been experiencing exponential growth, 92% CAGR from 2006-2016. Current mobile infrastructure cannot support next generation applications like remote healthcare, vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication for self-driving vehicles and next generation connected farming. These applications are constrained by the available bandwidth, low reliability and high latency of today's mobile networks. The industry is looking to expand reach and capacity of existing infrastructure to enable these applications with the potential to drastically communication. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build upon the existing low-loss photonic integrated circuit (PIC) Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter technology developed under Phase I by demonstrating a commercially viable three-dimensional (3D) PIC filter and canceler. The intellectual merit centers around the 3D PIC architecture with fast layer switching and ultra-low-loss waveguides for creating highly adaptable, tunable true time delays and detailed characterization of interfering signals in complex, dynamic multi-path reflection environments in cable and wireless solutions. The 3D PIC system aims to achieve under this project: total interference cancellation of >100 dB; small die footprint for a multi-tap cancellation FIR filter; high-speed switching; demonstration of full duplex communication links; and demonstration of band leakage and PIM interference cancellation in a laboratory environment. The improved designs will allow targeting additional markets in wireless communication involving complex interference cancellation scenarios that today severely limit spectrum utilization and network throughput. The proposed 3D PICs not only enable full duplex operation (co-channel self-interference) but also adjacent channel cancellation (guard band elimination) and passive intermodulation distortion (PIM) cancellation for higher throughput backhaul.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn wired and wireless communication networks, transceiver self-interference is one of the main barriers to higher throughput by preventing full-duplex communication.  Due to self-interference produced during signal transmission, including signal reflections from the environment, receive signals cannot be detected at the same frequency at the same time.  Current commercial systems allocate certain time periods or frequencies to separate transmit and receive signals ? resulting in significant spectrum waste.  Full duplex is the ability of a transceiver to transmit and receive information on the same frequency at the same time.  This promises to revolutionize communications through increased spectral efficiency, physically secure communication channels, and agile networking. \n\nUnder the NSF program, GenXComm built photonic true-time-delay based finite impulse response (FIR) filter modules. The modules provide the analog stage of self-interference cancellation sufficient to enable deployment of full duplex links in cable broadband and wireless (5G) communication systems.  The resultant novel RF-photonic architecture for self-interference cancellation delivers significant improvements in total cancellation and scaling characteristics verses the existing state of the art.\n\nThe performance of photonic FIR filters is heavily dependent on the propagation losses of light through its waveguides.  Due to the long optical delay paths required on the chip, propagation losses demonstrated in silicon (Si) photonics would result in virtually no light exiting the FIR filter chip.  Instead, GenXComm has focused on building photonic platforms featuring ultra-low-loss silicon nitride (Si3N4) waveguides (&lt;1dB/m) that demonstrate propagation losses two to three orders of magnitude lower than Si waveguides.\n\nIn Phase 2 of the SBIR/STTR program, GenXComm successfully integrated ultra-low-loss Si3N4 waveguides with crystalline Si waveguides to improve the performance and cost of the FIR filters.  This unique photonics platform offers an order of magnitude decrease in power, switch speed, and chip size for FIR filters.  GenXComm has also built an entire process design kit (PDK) for this novel photonic platform, enabling the technology to be applied to areas outside of FIR filters.  Adjacent applications can take advantage of the low optical loss and compact design, enabling advances in quantum computation, true time delays, gyroscopes, biosensors, and test &amp; measurement equipment.\n\nThese performance and cost advantages of this hybrid Si/Si3N4 platform enable immediate commercial application of FIR filters in wireless mesh networks, including private 5G installations, to overcome self-interference and enable full-duplex communication.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian A Mattis"
