 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project seeks financial support for enhancing graduate student and postdoc participation, at a Workshop to be held from September 15 to 20, 2019 at Ojai California. The \"Infrared Terahertz Quantum Workshop 2019\" will focus on a variety of novel physical phenomena in quantum- and electromagnetically-engineered photonic materials in the infrared and terahertz frequency range and the exploitation of these phenomena to create novel optoelectronic devices and applications. The Workshop will host world-renowned experts from leading institutions around the world. It will bring together academic, government, and industry scientists in an intimate venue to encourage close interaction and collaboration. The workshop will foster advances in the leading research of physics of inter-subband related low-dimensional systems, Mid-infrared and THz sources and detectors, collective effects in 2D systems (strong and ultra-strong coupling), Mid-infrared and THz materials and metamaterials and Mid-infrared and THz applications. In addition to about sixty technical talks, the organizers have also planned three plenary talks, ten invited talks. There will also be a poster session with thirty to fifty posters. A \"Focused session\" will also take place during the workshop. The focused session will be on Polaritonics and Strong Coupling Phenomena. The technical program will provide student participants with the opportunity to gain exposure to physics of inter-subband transitions and related devices and their engineering applications. There will be a vigorous exchange of new ideas on device technology that will benefit to students and young scholars in their pursuit of high-quality research. The meeting will promote scientific exchanges and discussions. The \"Infrared Terahertz Quantum Workshop 2019\" is expected to play a key role in identifying new directions for research. Exposing the next generation of researchers to these important disciplines is critical for learning how the new Infrared Terahertz Quantum science and technology progresses. Students will gain exposure to the new advances in this field. will allow international interactions and collaboration opportunities among the participants. In addition to the dissemination of scientific information associated with the workshop, the Workshop website will archive the talks, which will be generally available to a wide public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
