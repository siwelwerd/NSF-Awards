 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data centers represent ~2% of all electricity consumption in the United States, with a projected growth rate of 12% per year. Cloud service companies and mechanical/electrical infrastructure suppliers must continuously adapt to satisfy this growing demand, while meeting reliability, cost, and sustainability targets. Rather than focusing on energy and computing as separate problems, the Energy Information Nexus (EIN) consortium supports development of a new generation of data centers that embed power production and storage into the data center itself. On-site power at the rack or pod level offers many strategic advantages, including redundancy and reliability (eliminating the need for backup power), high efficiency, improved load following and supply management, as well as technological pathways to renewable energy based on stored fuels derived from intermittent wind and solar power. \r\n\r\nEIN will collaborate with industry and government partners to explore the use of fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors, DC power networks, and other energy technologies in data centers, and to identify and overcome key process and technology bottlenecks. Through collaborative research, industrial forums, educational initiatives, and public outreach, EIN will advance data center engineering as a leading arena for distributed power and energy storage, and facilitate our nation's transition toward energy sustainability. The Energy Information Nexus (EIN) will fulfill these goals through the following mission objectives: Conducting technoeconomic analyses and system modeling of new approaches to data center energy architecture. Quantitative case studies by EIN will allow members to forecast the directions of technology and business and to better position themselves for growth in this area. Performing pre-competitive research that accelerates development of embedded energy technology relevant to data centers. EIN research will focus on fundamental problems residing at key bottlenecks or junctures among technologies identified by industrial members. Interdisciplinary training of students to foster broad understanding of both computing and energy technology. EIN will bridge the divide between these technology arenas and create a new generation of engineers who understand the opportunities and constraints of both. Facilitating development of supply-chain standards with widespread support among industrial participants. EIN will help members develop new infrastructure and supply-chain standards such that participants in the supply chain share risk and synchronize businesses growth. Industrial and government membership of the EIN will span four principle overlapping business sectors including end users, infrastructure providers, energy technology developers, and utilities to facilitate a broad discussion to achieve the consortium's mission.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Colorado School of Mines (Mines) in collaboration with the University of Washington (UW -- lead institution) and the University of Califonia-Irvine (UCI) executed an NSF-IUCRC planning grant to explore the feasibility of esbalitshing an Industry-Univerisity Cooperative Research Center entitled Energy Information Nexus (EIN).  EIN has been proposed as a way to facilitate research and development in improving the synergies between renewable energy development and distributed power generationand energy storage with large-scale data centers and other energy-intensive IT infrastructure.  This planning grant involved several activities including the solication of potential industry and government agency partners, the planning of curriculum, and preliminary research into the interests and needs of key stakeholders in both the energy and IT infrastructure.  Due to the timing of the COVID-19 pandemic, our team was only able to house a virtual meeting to engage potential IUCRC partners, and the efforts to have an eventual IUCRC planning meeting have been disbanded until more clarity about a potential face-to-face planning meeting may take place to engage the various industry and government stakeholders.  All the same, the Colorado School of Mines explicitly had several key outcomes from the planning grant activities that address critical issues related to supporting the future development of the EIN.  These outcomes include the following\n\nengagement and preliminary expressions of support from potential EIN support from companies in data center engineering, energy storage industry, power generation, and IT industry associations;\nvirtual webinar eld by UW with broad range of industry participation in summer of 2020 to interact with industry regarding relevant energy and data center research and developments and expertise at collaborating institutions;\npreparing of a curriculum for a graduate certificate program at Mines in data center engineering to support the IUCRC's industry engagement and the delivery of one online course as a test case for future online delivery of the certificate program;\nPh.D. student summer research on review of novel thermal energy storage solutions for integrating with intermittent renewable resources for energy intensive data center engineering applications;\n\n\nAlthough the pandemic prevented this project from achieving tis goal of a successful planning meeting and the iniatition of the EIN IUCRC, the industry engagement and preliminary assessment of research and development needs for some stakeholders positions the team well for re-engaging with the various stakeholders to possibly have a center launch in the post-pandemic. near future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/05/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory Jackson"
