 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Young Mathematicians Conference (YMC), a premier annual conference for undergraduate research in mathematics, takes place during a weekend in August, from Friday noon until Sunday at noon. The conference has been running since 2003 with the ongoing support of NSF. YMC provides a venue for undergraduate students to present and disseminate the results of their research, discuss mathematics with their peers and with senior researchers, and receive recognition of their research achievements. Another primary mission of YMC is to inspire and encourage students, particularly women and traditionally underrepresented groups, to pursue mathematics as a career.\r\n\r\nStudents submit abstracts, which are judged and ranked by a panel of 40-70 faculty reviewers. Top-ranked students and their mentors are invited to participate in YMC. Besides student talks and a poster session, there are three plenary lectures delivered by world-class mathematicians to introduce students to topics related to high impact innovative research of current interest. Videos of these lectures are posted online. A Graduate School Orientation event invites representatives from PhD programs to provide information and insights about a graduate career in mathematics. YMC is a natural place to exchange ideas focused on undergraduate mentoring. Mentors from different institutions convene at a Mentors' Breakfast where they discuss best practices, previous experiences, and challenges related to supervising undergraduate research and mentorship. A strong online presence allows connections and continuity with past participants. The conference website is https://ymc.osu.edu/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nYMC 2023 provided a platform for young mathematicians to present their research, to meet mathematical peers, to network with professional mathematicians.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit: The core of the YMC is student talks and the poster session. Proposed talks and posters are reviewed by professional mathematicians. Applicants with accepted talks and proposals are invited to the conference, where they have a chance to present their work. This provides participants with an overview of REU research in \"pure\" mathematics at locations across the US. The question-and-answer time after each talk reflects the intellectual engagement that the participants have with each other's talks.\n\n\nThe student talks spanned a wide range of topics. This included geometry (\"Dehn invariant zero tetrahedra\" and \"Circle packings from tilings of the plane\"), some geometric group theory (\"Bounding VC dimension in nonabelian groups\" and another on the Heisenberg group), some analysis (\"A structure theorem on doubling measures for arbitrary bases\"), some algebra and number theory (\"Sum of consecutive terms of Pell and related sequences\" and \"Completions of quasi-excellent integral domains\"). This year included some \"quantum\" talks (\"Quantum chromatic numbers of quantum graph products\" and \"Topological order and boundary algebras for Kitaev's quantum double model\"). The talks generally tend on the \"pure\" side of mathematics, but YMC 2023 also included a talk on options pricing models. Ultimately, a key outcome for YMC 2023 is to convey to young mathematicians the breadth of undergraduate research in mathematics.\n\n\nPlenary talks by professional mathematicians are a second highlight of the YMC. These talks provide participants with a perspective on current research in various mathematical areas. YMC 2023 included talks from Alejandra Alvarado (Eastern Illinois University), Loredana Lanzani (Syracuse University, the University of Bologna), and Carmen Rovi (Loyola University). These plenary talks are made available on the YMC's YouTube channel. All told, the YMC's YouTube channel has received more than 5000 views.\n\n\nBroader Impacts: Beyond being a venue for young mathematicians to disseminate their research, YMC 2023 has broader impact on the mathematics community. The Graduate School Orientation program offers guidance and resources to students contemplating PhD studies in mathematics, providing insight into admission to PhD programs and an outline of what mathematical careers can look like.\n\n\nDemographics: A total of 201 individuals submitted 126 proposals for talks and posters. This applicant pool included 73 women; in terms of race and ethnicity, there were 99 white applicants, 98 Asian applicants, 14 Hispanic applicants, and 5 black applicants. Through evaluations from multiple faculty, a total of 62 presenters were chosen to present 39 projects. This latter group was composed of 26 women; in terms of race and ethnicity, there were 32 Asian presenters, 25 white presenters, 5 Hispanic presenters, and 2 black presenters.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LizRVivas\n"
