 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in the field of pneumatic valves, which control the flow of compressed gases through tubes or channels in industrial equipment and medical devices.  Examples of equipment which incorporate pneumatic valves include mass flow controllers, which are used to meter the flow of gases into chambers where electronic integrated circuits are fabricated, and medical devices, such as ventilators and portable oxygen systems.  Valves developed as an outcome of this project have the potential to largely displace current pneumatic valve technology, as they require less electric power to operate them, they respond faster, they generate less heat, and they may be cost-competitive.  Improved performance in mass flow controllers, enabled by the new valves, may make it possible to increase the production rate of computer processors and memory which are now ubiquitous in consumer products.  The low power consumption of the new valves expand the horizons for utilizing pneumatics in portable and wireless devices, such as human assist robotic devices.  The new valves are potentially suitable for usage in evolving fusion reactors for power generation, where powerful magnetic fields interfere with the utilization of conventional valves.  \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on a new architecture for pneumatic valves.  Pneumatic valves typically meter flow by moving a plate closer to an orifice to reduce flow or away from the orifice to increase flow.  The actuator used to move the plate in a conventional valve typically consists of an electromagnetic coil and plunger.  The new architecture replaces the electromagnetic actuator with a piezoelectric actuator.  Previous attempts at utilizing piezoelectric actuators have been limited by the fact that actuators with good displacement capacity produce very low force, which limits the pressure capacity of the valve, and actuators with good force capacity produce very low displacement, which limits the flow capacity of the valve.  This research is based on the discovery, in a prior NSF project, that the flow capacity of a valve which incorporates a low displacement actuator can be increased dramatically by replacing a single orifice with an array of micro-orifices. Market research will be performed in this project to develop a value proposition of the new technology in a target market of mass flow controllers.  The outcomes will be enlisted to guide future development of the new technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project addressed developing a commercialization strategy for a new proportional pneumatic valve technology invented at the University of Minnesota (UMN). \n\nPneumatic valves are used to control the flow of gases through devices;  for example, medical ventilators.  A pneumatic valve must contain an orifice (through which the gas flows), a sealing element to open and close the orifice, and an actuator to move the sealing element between the open and closed positions.  A pneumatic valve where the actuator can fully open the orifice (maximizing flow of gas through the valve), fully close the orifice (blocking flow through the valve, except for leakage), or partially open the orifice anywhere between the fully open and closed states is called a proportional valve. \n\nThe new pneumatic valves comprising the focus of this project utilize \"piezoelectric stack\", or \"piezostack\", actuators.  Most pneumatic valves utilize electromagnetic actuators.  Electrical current must flow through electromagnetic actuators to move them and hold them at partially or fully open positions.  In contrast, while current flow is required to move piezoelectric actuators, almost zero current is required to hold them at any set position.  Therefore, they consume much less energy than a conventional electromagnetic actuator. \n\nPiezoelectric stack actuators have another advantage: they can produce large forces.  As a result, they are more ?linear? than alternative actuator technologies, as they are little affected by changes in pressure across the valve. \n\nHowever, piezostacks also possess two disadvantages: they have very small displacements, and they are relatively expensive.  The flow capacity of valves which utilize piezostack actuators has previously been severely constrained by their small displacements.  Making them longer, which increases their displacement, further increases their cost.  Previous attempts to increase the flow capacity of valves using piezostack actuators has consisted of increasing the displacement of the sealing element by adding a mechanical motion amplifier between the piezostack and the sealing element.  This also increases the cost and complexity of the valve. \n\nThe technology comprising the focus of this work increases flow through valves using piezostack actuators by utilizing novel orifice plates or sealing elements.  The resulting valves can achieve good flow rates without adding a motion amplifier nor increasing the length of the piezostack.\n\nThis project specifically explored what is required to commercialize the novel technology described above.  The inventors had initially assumed that the new valves could be sold as general purpose valves.  However, the customer discovery process used in the I-CORPS training revealed that little market would exist, as the piezoelectric valves would not be cost-competitive with electromagnetic valves.  Rather, specialized markets would need to be identified that would justify the higher cost. \n\nA promising specialty market of mass flow controllers (MFCs) was identified through customer discovery.  Interestingly, the MFC market has little interest in the most obvious benefit of the piezoelectric valves: their low power consumption.  However, their high linearity is valued.  In addition, the new valves offer two additional benefits to MFCs: they are very fast (due to their small displacements), and they can be constructed to provide low leakage even when using all-metallic sealing elements (due to the high actuator forces).  (Metallic sealing elements increase the range of process gases with which the valves can be used.)  Indeed, some high-end mass flow controllers used in microelectronic fabrication systems already utilize piezostack actuators due to these attributes.  The UMN technology enables increasing the flow capacity of such valves using smaller piezostacks, which reduces the cost of the valves. \n\nThe eventual impact of the project may include lowering the cost and increasing the capability of microelectronics fabrication equipment, benefiting a myriad of electronics products. \n\nA secondary market of portable medical ventilators was identified.  These devices would benefit from the low power consumption of piezostacks, as batteries could be downsized.  This benefit may also justify the higher cost of the valve. \n\nIn this secondary market, the impact of the UMN valve may be to reduce the size and weight of medical ventilators.  This could especially benefit emergency response applications, such as airlifting.  In this regard, this project may incrementally improve the human condition. \n\nIn summary, mass flow controllers and portable medical ventilators were identified as target markets for a new pneumatic valve technology developed at the University of Minnesota.  Licensing agreements are being pursued in follow-up work.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/24/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas R Chase"
