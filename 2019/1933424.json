 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide educational developers, who may not be familiar with psychological and pedagogical theories, a design framework to help forge a new way of designing learning activities that will engage students and help them to accelerate and solidify their understanding of Science Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) concepts being taught in lab setting. The anticipated improvement of STEM education will be particularly beneficial to learners of disparate backgrounds who are traditionally less likely to pursue STEM degrees and for those who face learning challenges traditionally viewed as disabilities.  Success will mean institutions and departments of learning, both academic and corporate, will engage in more efficient ways of instilling knowledge and engendering skills to achieve a better trained and more inclusive STEM work force.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project will further develop a framework for the creation of effective educational software running in a three dimensional Virtual Learning Environment.   A set of design heuristics has been created that combine existing usability heuristics for general software design, educational software design, and software designed for virtual spaces, along with principles of human learning and memory taken from cognitive science.  The applications developed using this framework are Learning Machines that are deployed into a(three dimensional Virtual Learning Space.  The effectiveness of these applications are maximized through controlled implementation of evidence based principles of learning and memory during application design and user testing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAfter engaging in customer discovery to identify a customer and pain points over a 6 moonth period, we designed an MVP  for the first learning applicatioon to address those pain points.  To do this, we teamed with an instructor in a lower division undergraduate course in computer networking at the University of California at Santa Cruz.  After detailed analysis of the learning concepts and associated misconceptions in the course, a project based activity was designed and implemented as a semi-immersive Web3GL application.  In a future iteration we intend to port this application into a fully immersive environment so we chose Unity Game Engine to do the development work.  The technology stack also includes Linux OS, PostgreSQL database layer, and Matlab server installation.  The later component is used for processing the adaptive learning piece which takes activity input from the user and compares it with activity expected from an expert (one familiar with networking technology and concepts) to estimate the optimal intervention for the learner.  This intervention was given in the form of a hint (either text or visual) that has the highest likelihood of minimizing the distance between that user\u2019s path and an optimal path to a solution represented by those of exper users.  Errors are detected predominantly through evidence of misconceptions revealed by the user\u2019s actions when attempting to configure a ipV4 network topology.  This work was published by the EL Brad Thompson in a \"Work-in-Progress&ndash;LIVE: Model for Learning in Interactive and Immersive Virtual Environments.\" 2021 7th International Conference of the Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN). IEEE, 2021. The first MVP was tested in Fall of 2021 and results are currently being analyzed for dessimination.    \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sue A Carter"
