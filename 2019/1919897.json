 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Tennessee State University (TSU) to acquire a state-of-the-art portable photosynthesis system and soil gas analyzer that will enhance multidisciplinary research and student training at TSU, a Historically Black College and University. The new equipment will be integrated into the curriculum at both undergraduate and graduate levels to enrich the research training and learning. The acquisition of the instrument will increase the ability of the faculty to attract and mentor under-represented minority students in the fields of ecology, agriculture, and environmental sciences, provide hands-on research experience to students conducting independent research projects, and prepare a diverse and competent workforce. The project will also help improve agricultural practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect the environment. \r\n\r\nPhotosynthetic carbon fixation by plants plays a vital role for plant growth and crop yield while the releases of greenhouse gases from soils significantly influence global climate and environment. The equipment of photosynthesis system and greenhouse gas analyzer acquired will support research and teaching to address research questions in the areas of plant ecology, ecosystem ecology, crop molecular genetics and breeding, organic agriculture, and biogeochemistry. Specifically, the instrument will be used to investigate plant responses to drought and wet conditions, soil greenhouse gas emissions in grasslands and croplands, organic farming practices on crop physiology and production, and biochar and nitrogen applications on bioenergy crop and other crops? growth, yield, and soil greenhouse gas emissions. The acquisition of instrumentation will allow faculty and students to carry out the important research projects that would otherwise be significantly impeded at TSU. The requested instrument will greatly improve the research infrastructure for ecology, agriculture and environmental science research, enhance the faculty research capability, and improve their research productivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
