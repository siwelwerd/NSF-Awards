 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CombinaTexas 2019 conference will be held at Texas A&M University, in College Station, Texas, on March 23-24, 2019. The conference will take place on Saturday and Sunday to make it easy for researchers to attend, and will feature six fifty-minute plenary lectures and a number of twenty-minute contributed talks. The aim of the CombinaTexas conference series is to enhance the educational and research atmosphere of combinatorialists in Texas and the surrounding states, increase communication among mathematicians of the region, and provide a forum for presentation and discussion of the most recent developments in the field of Combinatorics. The first CombinaTexas conference was held in 2000; CombinaTexas 2019 is the eighteenth conference in this series. Over 65 participants are anticipated in 2019, with 20-25 contributed talks in parallel sessions. The conference will be publicized using distribution lists and on related conference websites.\r\n\r\nThe conference will feature a broad selection of combinatorial research. Researchers will present their new results and there will be time for open discussions to explore unsolved problems in the field. The confirmed plenary speakers are Ira Gessel (Brandeis University), Jessica McDonald (Auburn University), Criel Merino (UNAM, Mexico), Svetlana Poznanovikj (Clemson University), Brendon Rhoades (University of California, San Diego), and Joel Spencer (New York University). More details can be found at the conference website:\r\nhttp://www.math.tamu.edu/conferences/combinatexas/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
