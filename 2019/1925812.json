 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create a new re-use option for waste tires and, at the same time, provide an economical solution to remove siloxanes in landfill gas prior to combustion for electricity generation.  This novel technology for the treatment of landfill gas/biogas to remove siloxanes uses the smallest size fraction of waste tire rubber particles as the adsorption media. The innovation of this technology will make electricity generation from landfill gas more sustainable and more attractive economically.  In addition, the development of a new reuse market for waste tires will reduce the burden of tire disposal across the U.S.  By providing an economical solution for siloxane control as well as creating a reuse option for waste tires, the well-being of communities near landfills will potentially be improved.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project will help to propel electricity generation from landfill gas by removing one of the major obstacles to its use.  A major challenge to the use of landfill gas as a renewable energy source comes from trace contaminants, namely 'silica containing compounds' called siloxanes which are converted to silicon dioxide, a glass like substance that reduces engine efficiency, reduces heat transfer, increases scour and abrasion, and accelerates equipment deterioration.  This innovation is the development of a new siloxane adsorption process using waste tire rubber particles.  Using this approach, the siloxane nuisance in landfill gas to electricity plants will be mitigated. Currently, there are limited options for the reuse of the rubber material from waste tires.  The development of an effective adsorption process using the smallest size fraction of waste tire rubber particles represents an exciting entrepreneurial opportunity to turn this waste product into a marketable adsorbent that can compete with activated carbon adsorption for siloxane control.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research performed in this project as part of the I-Corps program evaluated the current marketplace with respect to biogas and landfill gas to energy projects and the interest in a new technology that would lower the costs of biogas cleaning for renewable energy recovery.  Our innovation proposes to use waste tire rubber material as a low-cost scrubber media in place of activated carbon for removing contaminants from biogas, namely hydrogen sulfide and siloxanes. Current scrubbing technologies are expensive and have a long payback time to recover capital and operating expenditures.  Our technology would lower the payback period for projects, thereby making gas to energy projects more lucrative.  Furthermore, current systems that use biogas and landfill gas in engine generators often experience engine damage due to siloxanes in the biogas.  Siloxanes which originate from cosmetics and other consumer products adhere to solids in wastewater treatment plants and are volatilized in the anaerobic digester.  They are considered environmentally friendly compounds, but when they are burned in an internal combustion engine, they produce silicates which plate out on engine surfaces such as valves and pistons resulting in engine wear and damage.  This wear on engines results in more frequent oil changes and engine tear downs increasing engine-generator downtime and operating costs.\n\nOur project team attending the Nation Science Foundation Innovation Corps training program in Nashville, TN.  As a result of this training the team performed customer discovery efforts aimed at assessing the market need for a more cost-effective siloxane removal process.  The team conducted over 110 interviews in relevant areas across the U.S.  Without being prompted, a universal observation from the interviewees was that siloxanes are a major deterrent to biogas to energy projects, both engine-generators for electricity production and direct injection to natural gas pipelines for renewable natural gas production.  The team learned that there is a renewed interest in pipeline injection projects due to the potential for renewable identification number (RIN) credits which often exceed the value of the gas itself.  These credits can reduce the payback period for projects making them more favorable for investors.  One deterrent however has been the strict siloxane limits imposed by the natural gas utilities.  Currently, there is no national standard for gas quality for injection into the natural gas pipeline.  There was a consensus among interviewees that a more cost-effective siloxane removal process would be well received.  Furthermore, a scrubbing technology that used a waste product (in our case from scrap tires) would be viewed favorably especially in light of the lower cost.\n\nThere are approximately 14,748 municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants in the U.S. but not all have anaerobic digestion producing biogas.
