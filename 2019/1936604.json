 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical abstract \r\nMeeting of New Investigators is organized to provide researchers with necessary information about NSF process, opportunities and mechanisms related to proposal submission. A group of first-time applicants or those who did not apply to NSF in the past will be provided helpful information designed to improve their proposal writing skills and understand the NSF process better. A mock proposal review activity will enable better understanding of the merit review process. Participation of PIs from small colleges and underrepresented groups was encouraged. Applicants from underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply, with a goal of broadening participation of talented new PIs from diverse backgrounds in STEM research.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract \r\nParticipants of the 2019 MPS Workshop for New Investigators will receive information about the NSF process presented by current or past Program Directors. Specifically, the participants will be trained in Merit Review Principles, writing a successful proposal, building a strong Broader Impact component, Conflict of Interest and Ethics rules and they will learn about funding opportunities within NSF. Participants will write and review one-page proposals, to be evaluated by panels, including a full panel review process, discussion and writing panel summaries. The two-day intensive training obtained during the Workshop is expected to be most beneficial to a diverse pool of young PIs and increase their chances of successful interactions with NSF.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by Divisions within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences: Division of Physics, Division of Mathematical Sciences, Division of Chemistry, Division of Astronomical Sciences and Division of Materials Research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStarting from the 2019 workshop we made special efforts to recruit the young PI\u2019s in URM.  In 2019, 48% and 14% of the total invitees (100) were female and in URM, respectively.  In 2020, much higher representation in these groups was achieved: 64% and 37% of the total invitees (110) were female and in URM, respectively.   Despite the COVID-19 situation we felt that it was important not to lose the momentum and to continue to support this important endeavor.  As a stopgap, the 2020 Workshop was made as an online event with slightly reduced scope.  However, the number of applicants for 2020 workshop almost tripled from 184 in 2019 to 464.  For 2020 online workshop with 110 participants, we tried to maintain the previous year\u2019s program in one and a half day.  Overall, the workshop went smoothly but we realized that this workshop really needed two full days to digest the full program. \n\n         Since 2019, we installed an assessment plan.  For 2019 participants, two surveys have been conducted.  The first one was right after the workshop to receive feedbacks on the organization and the program of the workshop for future improvements.  The second survey, conducted about 1 year later, is designed to gauge the efficacy of the workshop in securing grants and panel review participation.  For 2020, feedbacks from the participants as well as the program directors were received, and the second survey is in the plan.  Despite overwhelmingly positive responses, there are certainly a few things that need to be reviewed and improved.\n\n       Our efficacy survey revealed that 52.3% of the participants succeeded in securing grants from NSF (33.3% one grant and 19% more than one), and 23.5% of them received CAREER awards after participating the workshop.  One third of the participants also secured funding from other agencies.  30.5% and 38.9% of the participants participated in the panel review processes in NSF and other funding agencies, respectively.     The results of the surveys were reported to NSF. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yoonseok Lee"
