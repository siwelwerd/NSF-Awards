 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to enhance the realism of educational virtual laboratories, this project will research and develop educational virtual laboratories in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) through software-controlled haptic vessels for realistic perceptions of fluid handling. In chemistry education, fluids play a critical role, especially in where they can represent different volumes, render physical properties (e.g., viscosity), and mix to create combinatorial reactions. To provide education regarding the handling of fluids), most chemistry curricula use laboratory exercises which guide students through hands-on manipulation experiments. The proposed vessel systems will be 3D-printed enclosures that are spatially tracked and internally motorized to give the look and feel of vessels (e.g., beakers), cylinders, flasks, and test tubes, that contain free-moving fluids in VR and AR.  Augmented fluidity vessels will enable experimentation possibilities in virtual laboratories for distance education.  The project will develop preliminary mechanisms, software frameworks, and AR/VR educational laboratory simulations for formative evaluation of the potential of augmented fluidity in at-home, after-school, and online education. Software tools and vessel designs will be open sourced and distributed. Outside developers will be able to create their own simulations, experiments, and fluid vessel devices relevant to their needs and workplaces. Through the use of game engine plugins and 3D printable materials, the project will provide access to software developers at all levels, including Grade 6-12 students, university students, and professional software developers.\r\n\r\nProject research will address issues of realism, haptics, usability, and efficacy of the VR/AR system. The project will develop preliminary mechanisms, software frameworks, and AR/VR educational laboratory simulations for formative evaluation of the potential of augmented fluidity in at-home, after-school, and online education. The preliminary versions of the system will be tested through focus groups and other qualitative methods.When preliminary development and formative testing is complete, the project will conduct a summative assessment with mixed methodologies including an experimental design which will look at aptitude by treatment interactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
