To accomplish this, we organized a series of catalytic activities, such as online brainstorming sessions, in-person workshops, invited seminars/colloquia, etc., to form an integrative and multidisciplinary research team, to develop partnerships with industry and national laboratories, to engage local community and domestic/international institutions, as well as to assess the infrastructure needs and the potential technological and societal impacts. A key unifying challenge that we addressed was development of scalable platforms for realization of quantum information processing systems that could outperform classical systems at specific tasks. We had proposed development of a realistic experimental toolbox for quantum information processing.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit: As a result of numerous Zoom meetings, our QLCI-CG team has converged on proposing to use distributed integrated photonics platforms with fiber interconnects to demonstrate the viability of special-purpose hardware for achieving a quantum advantage over classical approaches. Platforms based on both continuous-variable and discrete variable quantum information processing would be developed. The key advantage of using photonics is that it allows for all-to-all connectivity. We targeted two cross-cutting applications, optimization and machine learning, for which all-to-all connectivity would provide a significant reduction in overhead. The development of special-purpose (not necessarily universal) quantum hardware would provide a near-term route for demonstrating its utility at tackling difficult computational tasks. The primary advantage would be in terms of noise mitigation: special-purpose hardware would not have the same control requirements, and thus we could expect an increased noise budget allowing for larger and longer computations.</p>\n<p>The program helped facilitate the development of quantum-related courses, support the dissemination of knowledge regarding quantum information processing, and expose students to seminars in the Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) area. The QLCI-CG grant has been instrumental in the development of plans for a new interdisciplinary graduate program in QISE at the University of New Mexico.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts: The QLCI-CG project has led to creation of the IEEE Quantum Science and Engineering Education Conference (QSEEC), which is expected to continue in the coming years. The first conference, held on Sept. 18, 2022, had over 100 registered participants. The conference continued to expand in 2023, and is expected to have 2 parallel sessions over 2 days in 2024. All three QSEEC conferences have been chaired by the PI. QSEEC brings together education researchers and practitioners to delve into methodologies for crafting curricula and tools that facilitate effective instruction. Central to the conference mission is addressing the increasing demand for QISE education and bridging the divide between teachable concepts and practical applications. It serves as a forum for educators and professionals in the field to share perspectives and insights. QSEEC is hosted alongside the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing &amp; Engineering as part of IEEE Quantum Week, utilizing a unified registration and submission system.</p>\n<p>QSEEC22 took place on September 18, 2022, in Broomfield, CO. Presentations included proposed courses, curricula, or standards frameworks, including rationale for their structure and implementation strategies, etc. Images 1 and 2 show the title page and the committees page from the QSEEC22 program booklet.</p>\n<p>QSEEC23 took place as a hybrid event, featuring both in-person attendance and virtual participation, in Bellevue, Washington, USA. Building on the success of three previous IEEE Quantum Week events, it was exciting to curate an exceptional conference program. The conference included live exhibits, distinguished keynote speakers, technical paper presentations, interactive workshops to foster community engagement, tutorials aimed at workforce development, engaging panel discussions, innovative poster presentations, and ample networking opportunities. Image 3 shows the cover page of a stand-alone volume of QSEEC Proceedings, published for the first time in 2023.</p>\n<p>QSEEC24 will be held in Montreal, Canada in September 2024, as part of IEEE quantum week, and will act as a vital link between the realm of quantum computing and its rapidly evolving industry. IEEE Quantum Week distinguishes itself as a comprehensive platform covering both quantum computing and engineering disciplines, granting participants a unique opportunity to delve into discussions surrounding challenges and prospects. Attendees include quantum researchers, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, developers, students, practitioners, educators, programmers, and newcomers, fostering a diverse and enriching exchange of ideas.</p>\n<p>The grant has also provided a means for established researchers in the field of quantum technology to present their research to the general public and interested student population through the Seminar Series, held at University of New Mexico.
