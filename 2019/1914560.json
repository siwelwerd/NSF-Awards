 "awd_abstract_narration": "The link between DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light and genetic mutation is well established, but the determinants of hotspots of photochemical reactivity where UV damage is most likely to occur remain elusive. This project will address the origins and locations of these hotspots with a focus on how damage accumulates as a result of competition between its formation and spontaneous self-repair. The outcomes should inform future strategies for better protection of genomes from UV damage. The project will offer cross-disciplinary training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students as they study molecular processes affecting the viability of life under UV exposure, and prepare them for diverse careers that serve the public interest.\r\n\r\nCurvature of duplex DNA was previously reported as a crucial variable in the formation and distribution of photochemical damage. Whether this property controls initial formation of the products or their steady state levels, established by competing formation and self-repair processes, has yet to be determined. Similarly, the sequences of DNA where damage is most sensitive to curvature have not been determined. Both of these unknowns will be addressed by probing a library of DNA sequences that can be switched between linear and bent conformations. The reversibility of UV damage will be assessed by the rate at which product profiles created by these two states of DNA interconvert, and sequences within the library most influenced by bending will be characterized by deep sequencing. The sequences most susceptible to UV damage will be reconstructed by statistical analysis and used to validate the correlation between sequence, conformation and hyperreactivity in vitro.\r\n\r\nThis award was co-funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Division of Chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSunlight is a joy to us all but excessive exposure can be harmful because of its ability to induce skin cancer.  The genesis of this disease derives from absorption of the ultraviolet component of sunlight by our DNA.  Usually the light energy is dissipated without harm but occasionally adjacent pyrimidine bases will cyclize to form a dimer structure.  While a variety of biological mechanisms are available to repair these dimers, their presence still often correlates with mutations in DNA.  Persistent mutations represent the next step in the complex process that creates cancer.  The fields of physics, chemistry and biology have all helped to describe the many variables controlling the accumulation and biological consequences of these dimers and yet the fundamental principles underlying these variables are still debated.  For example, neighboring nucleotides are empirically known to affect dimer accumulation but why this occurs has not been identified.  Similarly, dimer accumultation is affected by subtle variations in the helical shape of duplex DNA, yet the origins of this also remain to be determined.  Collectively, these differences are typically ascribed to variable rates of dimer formation even though there is significant precedence that dimerization is reversible under most conditions of ultraviolet irradiation.\n\nOur laboratory borrowed from two well characterized systems of DNA to demonstrate that most prior observations derive from a competition between formation and reversion of the dimers.  A heterogeneous sequence within a linear duplex of DNA forms a relatively even distribution of dimers while the same DNA when bent will generate a periodic increase and decrease of dimers along its sequence.  The time of irradiation required to form these two distinct patterns was then compared to the time required to relax the periodic distribution to a random distribution after the bent DNA was linearized.  We discovered that these times were the same.  Thus, accumulation of dimers is dynamic and responds to conformational changes in the same time frame as initial dimer formation.  A similar analysis was repeated for a circular and linear form of duplex DNA and again, the relaxation of the dimer distribution occurred within the same time frame as its initial formation.  Thus, future investigations must look beyond merely the formation of dimers and begin to consider dimer reversion as well when determining the fundamental principles influencing the presence of dimers that ultimately contribute to mutation and cancer.\n\nThis research helped to support the training of 4 graduate students who gained skills in designing experimental protocols, collecting and processing data and communicating their discoveries at a professional level.  Perhaps most important to their future success is a new found ability to identify and solve problems in independent research.  One of these students had the opportunity to intern at a premier biotechnology company and has since graduated and immediately found employment at a second biotechnology company.  An underrepresented minority undergraduate also participated in this research.  He became completely enamored by experimental science and has since joined the graduate program in chemical biology at Harvard.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven E Rokita"
