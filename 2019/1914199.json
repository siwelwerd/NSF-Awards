 "awd_abstract_narration": "All astrophysical and cosmological data now point convincingly to a large component of Cold Dark Matter in the Universe, whose presence we only infer gravitationally.  A well-motivated candidate for Dark Matter is a light axion. Axions have been introduced to explain the smallness of the violation of the Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry in Quantum ChromoDynamics, the theory describing the action of the strong force. Dark matter axions may be detected through their conversion into a narrow Radio Frequency (RF) signal in a microwave-cavity resonator permeated by a magnetic field. This Yale-Berkeley-Colorado collaboration came together to design, build and operate an advanced technology experiment, HAYSTAC, to serve both as an innovation test-bed to develop new cavity designs and quantum-limited photon detection schemes, and as a pathfinder to take first data in the 10 - 50 micro-eV mass range, well above all previous such searches for axions. \r\n\r\nR&D on superconducting thin-films, and sub-quantum-limited photon detection will certainly produce unanticipated spin-offs, just as the NSF-supported development of the Microstrip SQUID Amplifier for axions did in the quantum information world. HAYSTAC has already proven to be a great attractor for young talent, more than half being women; this award can only be expected to extend this record. In addition, it is planned to establish a rotating exhibit on dark-sector science at the San Francisco Exploratorium utilizing prototypes and artifacts from many of the historic dark sector and cosmic microwave background experiments.\r\n\r\nShort of finding the axion, HAYSTAC has been extraordinarily successful. During the past three-year period, the experiment has achieved essentially quantum-limited operation (no other experiment has come within an order of magnitude). In preparation for Phase II, Berkeley has designed and built a microwave cavity with a high figure of merit for the 6 - 12 GHz range (~ 25 - 50 micro-eV). Colorado has designed, built and characterized a squeezed-vacuum state receiver, now being commissioned in HAYSTAC - it will be the first-ever sub-quantum receiver for a dark-matter experiment, and with LIGO the first squeezed-state receivers for data production in the world of fundamental physics. Furthermore, the group will produce a first cavity prototype incorporating planar thin-films of NbTiN, a Type-II superconductor, to achieve a boost in quality factor Q by an order of magnitude, a gain that would map directly into mass scan rate. Each of these innovations dramatically enhances the discovery potential of HAYSTAC.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs part of the HAYSTAC experiment searching for the dark matter of the Universe, the University of California Berkeley team has provided critical technology in microwave cavities and resonators.  The purpose of HAYSTAC (Haloscope At Yale Sensitive To Axion Cold dark matter) is to search for a hypothetical ultralight particle, called the axion, which may constitute the dark matter.  The basic principle of the experiment is that in a strong magnetic field, axions can resonantly convert to photons in a microwave cavity, which can be detected with very sensitive amplifiers.  The expected signal strength nevertheless is very weak, on the order of a trillionth of a trillionth of a watt.\n\nIn the past three years, the HAYSTAC collaboration achieved a major breakthrough, the first-ever operation of a quantum-enhanced receiver which enabled the experiment to circumvent a fundamental limitation of linear amplifiers, called the standard quantum limit, and thus speeding up the mass scan of the search by a factor of two.  HAYSTAC was the first dark matter experiment to do so, and along with LIGO which discovered gravitational radiation, is one of only two experiments in fundamental physics data taking to use this technique, called \"squeezed vacuum states\".  This work was published in the journal Nature in February, 2021, and has attracted great interest.\n\nOne of the purposes of HAYSTAC is to serve as a technology test-bed for innovative concepts in quantum amplifiers and microwave cavities.  Under this NSF award, UC Berkeley has developed new types of cavities and resonators for the experiment, as well as producing and maintaining the cavities used in the actual search.  These include a Photonic Band Gap structure, which is similar to a microwave cavity, but replaces the barrel part by a stockade of metallic rods.  One can design this structure to isolate the mode of interest to the experiment, while radiating away nuisance modes which clutter the spectrum, and interfere with smoothly tuning in frequency.  The other major innovation was the exploration of wire medium metamaterials, which can be used in a microwave resonator that is both arbitrarily large and arbitrarily high in frequency, as there are compelling reasons to extend the search to higher mass ranges.\n\nIn addition to papers on HAYSTAC science data, the UC Berkeley group has published two papers on microwave cavities and resonators, with a third submitted for publication, and currently being modified.  Three Ph.D. students have graduated during the time of this award (two women); two of them are postdoctoral researchers in DOE labs, Fermilab and Berkeley lab, working in accelerator physics, a critical national need.  The third is a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University continuing in dark matter research.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/21/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karl A Van Bibber"
