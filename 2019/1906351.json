 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project revolves around the study of natural model spaces.  In the past, until a century and a half ago, the only model whose geometry was investigated was (flat) Euclidean space - this is the geometry that we all learned in high school.  However, in order to advance science and engineering, we need to use models that incorporate curvature - for example, the Earth is not flat, it is round!  To this end, the principal investigator (PI) will study special model geometries called homogeneous Einstein spaces to learn more about their basic properties and work towards their classification.  The PI will develop new tools for analyzing these spaces and utilize the graduate student support to train a new generation of mathematicians in their application. \r\n\r\nThe PI will conduct an investigation into homogeneous Einstein metrics by continuing to develop tools from Geometric Invariant Theory and their interaction with tools from Geometric Analysis.  The goal of this program is to classify non-compact, homogeneous Einstein manifolds and determine if all such spaces are, in fact, solvmanifolds.  Even further, the PI will investigate the distinguished geometric and algebraic properties of Einstein and Ricci soliton spaces.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nMathematical research starts by looking at the world around us and asking, what if? What if the Earth were perfectly round? What could we say about its geometry? Moving from this ideal model, we then extend our understanding to a world that isn't quite ideal and instead has variations that add to the complexity and intrigue.\n\n\nThe supported project studied geometric spaces with a high degree of symmetry and nice curvature properties. The model spaces investigated were the so-called homogeneous Einstein and Ricci soliton spaces. For these special spaces, we discovered new symmetry properties. More precisely, it was shown that these spaces have the most possible symmetry. (As an example, a perfectly round sphere has more symmetry than the Earth with all its mountains and valleys.)\n\n\nThe results obtained during the supported project open the door to new avenues of investigation. Based on our new evidence, we can reasonably ask the fundamental question: does every space has some distinguished shape which is most symmetric?\n\n\nThe tools and techniques developed lie at the intersection and frontier of algebra, geometry, and calculus. These new geometric tools have been applied to algebraic models, as well, obtaining new algebraic rigidity results.\n\n\nThrough the support of the grant, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students were trained in cutting edge techniques in differential geometry.\n\n\nAn essential component of mathematicial research is the exchange of new ideas. The PI and students visited other mathematicians to share our new techniques and to learn the novel tools being developed at other universities. Likewise, leading experts in the field were brought to Oklahoma to share their research with Oklahoma students and faculty.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MichaelJablonski\n"
