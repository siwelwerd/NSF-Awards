 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funded by the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) program, this faculty development workshop aims to increase faculty usage of new learning materials produced by two innovative projects that emphasize the geometric aspects of multi-variable and vector calculus. These projects, \"Raising Calculus to the Surface\" and \"The Vector Calculus Bridge Project\" also emphasize a learner-centered pedagogical approach. This three-day workshop will enable at least 24 university level mathematics faculty members to learn about the tools and pedagogy to support student learning of 3-dimensional calculus concepts. In the workshop, participants will also write materials for use in their classrooms. \r\n\r\nThe geometric approach and small-group activities developed by the workshop organizers mesh well with the recommendations of the Mathematical Association of America's Curriculum Guide and its Instructional Practices Guide. In particular, since the workshop will be conducted by both mathematicians and physicists, the development of mathematical thinking and communication skills and the promotion of interdisciplinary cooperation will be featured. Features built into the \"Raising Calculus to the Surface\" materials encourage instructor adoption of these practices, and strong demand among instructors for the 3-dimensional surface manipulatives has previously been observed. An evaluation of the workshop will include surveying the participants and dissemination of the new materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
