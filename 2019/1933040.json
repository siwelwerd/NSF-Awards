 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Distributed Arrays of Small Instruments (DASI) project supported by the Geospace Infrastructure and Facilities program  will provide long-term observations of the Earth's magnetosphere aimed at  studying geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). During geomagnetic storms, GICs can impact power grids, particularly those with aging transformers. The recent 2019 as well as the previous 2015 National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plans call for further study of induced geoelectric fields. The high-quality instruments to be deployed will add to the sparse coverage of the continental U.S.  and provide reliable streams for the science as well as operations  community. Magnetometers will be deployed at six sites across the country.\r\n\r\nImproved spatial coverage of magnetometers with the enhanced temporal resolution and noise characteristics has the potential to advance a broad cross- and inter-disciplinary range of scientific research across the geosciences, including geophysics, magnetospheric physics, ionospheric physics, and GIC science. Some of the most important questions in these fields, for example localized enhancements of GIC drivers, cannot progress until magnetic field data at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales becomes available. The scientific and operational goals can be met concurrently, through high-quality measurements, delivered in real-time (less than a second latency), with advanced industrialized components and data transfer infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
