 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the enabling technologies mature, humanoid robots will find numerous practical applications, as personal assistants in the home, first-responders in disaster relief, and as pre-deployed space exploration assets. This project will advance the capabilities of NASA's humanoid robot, Valkyrie, to replace human hands for safe and risk-averse operations in existing science gloveboxes commonly found in nuclear facilities. The project is motivated by the fact that the dirty, dull and dangerous tasks ideal for human-supervised robots are extensively found in thousands of gloveboxes being used today. The risk-averse control framework for humanoid robots will provide significant contributions to robotics and robot manipulation fields; the resulting technologies will also significantly improve the safety of humans, accuracy of operations, and cost-effectiveness associated with operations in high-consequence material handling applications. Successful completion of this project will not only progress the technological readiness of humanoids for practical applications but also will contribute new knowledge to the field including how to translate human commands to safe robot control methods. The project will create programs and tools to train a workforce with new skills including teleoperation and interface design. \r\n\r\nThe research goals of the project will make novel contributions to the fields of constrained robot manipulation and human-robot interaction. Specifically, this project will (1) validate a human-supervised control framework for the risk-averse and intuitive operation of NASA's humanoid robot, Valkyrie, performing common tasks found in science gloveboxes such as pushing and sliding objects to the discharge ports; (2) develop theory and practice for perception based robot manipulation and design novel solutions to handle uncertainty, blend motion/force planning with high-level human input and ambient intelligence to robustly execute practical tasks; (3) introduce and refine the operational principles and evaluate safety significance of deploying humanoids in nuclear operations; (4) develop new paradigms for applicability of humanoid robots in nuclear clean-up by optimizing performance on a task-by-task basis. The project outcomes will create new approaches in addressing multidisciplinary challenges at the intersection of hardware/software co-design, control theory, robotics, and human-robot interaction.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Humans perform well in a diverse class of mobility tasks due to our form, shape and size: tasks such as climbing, crawling, and traversing different terrains including rubble and sand. Bipedal humanoid robots, such as Valkyrie by NASA's Johnson Space Center, have great potential to perform a variety of complex human-like mobility and manipulation tasks, such as climbing, crawling, traversing rough terrain and reaching behind obstacles as compared to their wheeled or tracked counterparts. This makes them suitable for deployment in cluttered and dynamic environments that typically require making contacts with the surroundings, such as manipulation inside science glove boxes; in spaces specifically designed for humans, such as habitats to support future manned space missions; in operating human tools such as hand drills; and utilizing human interfaces such as switches, plugs, and door handles. The trade-off, however, is the complexity that comes with the high degrees of freedom. For example, the well-studied 2D navigation problem for a mobile robot becomes a multi-faceted research and development effort which incorporates path planning, step-planning, balancing and locomotion control. A bipedal humanoid robot has to maintain balance at all times.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many of the world's nuclear reactors are aging, and from Japan to U.K. to the United States, scientists, engineers and regulators are counting on new innovative technologies that will make decommissioning missions safe for humans, environment friendly and cost effective. It is now clear that robotics will play a key role in addressing some of the challenges associated with this clean-up facing our society in the next 50 years. Our team had first-hand experiences observing various processes including nuclear material handling, liquid waste management, the deactiviation and decommissioning (D &amp; D) process, and glovebox operations. At the Savannah River Site, there are more than 3500 gloveboxes in use today. Each glovebox activity requires at least three workers: an operator, a radiological control inspector, and a supervisor. Even though &nbsp;safety is paramount in all Department of Energy operations, accidents do sometimes occur. In 2010, a technician received a puncture wound while working in a glovebox and the accident resulted in internal contamination with transuranic elements. How might we avoid such accidents that put skilled humans at risk? There are plans for decommissioning the DOE 235-F Plutonium Fuel Form Facility. The planned activities include restoration of services to the Plutonium Fuel Form Facility (PuFF) gloveboxes, and decontamination of the gloveboxes.
