 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, Dr. Gevorgyan is developing novel transition metal-catalyzed methods to synthesize organic molecules with structures containing rings. Existing methods to synthesize these molecules produce unwanted by-products as waste and/or require expensive reagents, and thus, the broad application of these methodologies is often limited. To address this problem, the development of novel catalytic methods for the selective, efficient, and general construction of organic ring structures is being pursued by Dr. Gevorgyan and his research group at University of Illinois-Chicago. The broader impacts of the proposed work are providing new and effective routes to building block molecules of importance to areas as diverse as biology and materials science, where they are utilized in the assembly of more complex molecules and materials. Moreover, this research is dramatically reducing the cost of chemicals and producing less waste, and thus, this research produces chemicals with less environmental impact. In addition, Dr. Gevorgyan is actively engaging in outreach activities for recruiting minority undergraduate students from Chicago City Colleges into research. Student involvement in research at UIC is projected to unlock the students' potential talents and creativity, increase their retention in College, and enhance their career possibilities.\r\n\r\nIn this project, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Gevorgyan of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Chicago is developing a set of novel migratory cycloisomerization and cycloaddition protocols toward assembly of multisubstituted carbo- and heterocyclic molecules. The project includes several aspects: (1) development of novel migratory cycloisomerization reactions toward fused carbo- and heterocyclic cores; (2) development of migratory benzannulation reactions toward densely substituted aromatic molecules; (3) development of innovative transposition reactions; and (4) development of new types of transannulation reaction. It is believed that these innovative reactions allow for a dramatic increase of molecular complexity, thus giving easy access to important, densely-substituted frameworks from simple precursors. This project, which is at the interface of organometallic and organic chemistry and catalysis is providing multidisciplinary training at undergraduate and graduate levels, and thus has a broad impact on their continuing education. In addition, Dr. Gevorgyan is actively engaging in outreach activities for recruiting minority undergraduate students from Chicago City Colleges.",
