 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract: \r\nCondensed matter research has produced many novel materials with fundamental properties that underpin a remarkable number of cutting-edge technologies. It is now generally accepted that novel materials are necessary for critical advances in technologies and whoever discovers novel materials generally controls the science and technology of the future. The 4d- and 5d- transition metal elements constitute two thirds of the d-transition metal elements listed in the Periodic Table. However, these materials have remained largely unexplored. This project presents a systematic effort to discover, investigate and control novel quantum states in 4d/5d materials. A delicate balance between spin-orbit and other competing interactions inherent in these materials offers a unique range of opportunities to uncover and control exotic states and physical properties.  This project also provides rigorous training to all students involved, focusing on synthesis and characterization techniques covering a broad spectrum of materials and experimental probes available in the principal investigator's laboratory. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: \r\nPhysics driven by spin-orbit interactions is among the most important topics in contemporary condensed matter physics. This project is driven by Two Interconnected Thrusts - Discovery of New Quantum Materials and Control of Novel Quantum States. Thrust One: The PI targets three Subgroups of 4d/5d materials for single-crystal synthesis and study: 1. Oxides, 2. S- and Se-based chalcogenides and 3. Tellurides. The underlying behavior of these subgroups is expected to systematically evolve from more correlated, insulating states (oxides) to more spin-orbit-coupled, metallic states (tellurides) via a crossover regime dictated by complex structures (S or Se chalcogenides). This key trend provides unique circumstances to effectively tune the relative strength of correlations and spin-orbit interactions (SOI) in order to uncover/control exotic states in an unprecedented fashion. Thrust Two: The SOI exhibits particularly strong and surprising influence on the physical properties of the 4d/5d materials, in which a key characteristic is that the SOI can rigidly lock magnetic moments to the lattice, leading to novel behavior.  The PI investigates lattice-control physical properties of spin-orbit-coupled materials via application of electrical current, hydrostatic pressure, or chemical doping. Electrical-current control of structural and physical properties is a long-sought, but elusive goal of contemporary science and technology. The PI's recent discovery demonstrates that a combination of strong SOI and a canted antiferromagnetic Mott state is sufficient to attain this important goal. The Nation is committed to a quantum revolution but is poorly supported by the lack of scientists who are experienced in quantum materials discovery and synthesis. This project is well-timed to address this problem via rigorous graduate training emphasizing materials discovery and synthesis and providing high-quality crystals of novel materials for extensive collaborations, which is necessary to advance our collective understanding of the novel phenomena under study.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
