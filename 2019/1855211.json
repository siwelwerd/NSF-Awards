 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tap water treated and monitored by the water distribution system has generally thought to be safe. However, several recent failures of water infrastructure that we rely on for this safety have highlighted the need to better understand and monitor the Nation's water quality. Recent research has shown that water quality can deteriorate from the source at the drinking water treatment plant to the taps in homes. A focus of this research is on in-building \"premise plumbing\", the least understood and monitored part of the water distribution system. Premise plumbing has the highest surface-to-volume ratios in the distribution system, making it susceptible to pipe surface chemical and biological reactions. In addition, water can often sit stagnant in small pipes for days, resulting in loss of residual disinfectant activity and resulting pathogen growth in pipe surface biofilms. This project will determine how to reduce the decay of disinfectant, the formation of toxic disinfectant byproducts, and the growth of pathogens in biofilms that grow on premise plumbing surfaces. This will be achieved by controlled experiments with disinfectants and molecular level characterization of the microbes present in the biofilm. Results will be shared with the drinking water industry, water regulators, and other stakeholders to develop best management practices for ensuring the safety of home drinking water.\r\n\r\nA systematic study is proposed to understand how, when, and where risk occurs in premise plumbing. The research is based on the following hypotheses: (H1) drinking water chemical constituents control the porous structure of premise plumbing biofilms; (H2) these biofilm properties control the mass exchange of disinfectant between the biofilm and bulk aqueous phases and consequently the residual concentrations of disinfectants; and (H3) laboratory biofilms grown in the presence of drinking water will have diffusion and reaction properties of biofilms occurring in premise plumbing networks supplied from those sources. A collaborative research program will test these hypotheses through a multi-stage research program. First, biomass growth under stagnant conditions with depleted disinfectant concentrations on PEX and PVC, common premise plumbing materials using tap water amended with anti-scaling and/or anti-corrosion chemicals to simulate treated drinking water. H1 will be tested by analyzing 3D porous structure of biofilm matrix based on optical coherence tomography of biofilms grown from these different waters. H2 will be tested by quantifying the interaction of disinfectant with biofilm via coupon- and pipe-section scale reactive transport experiments and modeling. H3 will be tested by quantifying free chlorine decay and formation of disinfectant byproducts in building scale experiments at the University of Illinois and Washington State University under different stagnation times. Successful completion of this research will transform our knowledge of biofilm growth and disinfectant chemistry in premise plumbing and help regulators and other stakeholders better manage water supply systems to protect human health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe important outcomes of this project from the WSU contributions are fourfold. First we figured out how to calculate the rates of depletion by thin biofilms of disinfectant chemicals used in treatment of drinking water. This is important because biofilms are actually widely present in drinking water piping systems and they gobble up the disinfectants that your water utility puts in the drinking water to protect us from health risks. Second we figured our a way to completely revamp a large class of math models called \"compartment models\" to make them much more realistic. These compartment models are used everywhere and yet they are not very realistic. One example is the Covid pandemic. Most folks know the incubation period takes like four days. But the models used to describe the pandemic to Boris Johnson in England and to President Trump in the US at the time said that the incubation period ranged from zero days to 3 days with most of the incubation happening over one day. They had to because that's how compartment models work. Our approach allows the model to represent the incubation period as revealed in cllinical data. We even re-ran that very same Covid model and got different results. Third, we came up with a single simple equation that your high-schooler can calculate on a laptop to describe how stuff moves in pipes, in rivers, and in groundwater paths. People have been looking for this equation since the 1970s. Fourth we made a really cool web-based computer program that anyone can use that counts how long water sits in your house's plumbing system (or any building plumbing system, like those in schools and hospitals). Knowing that is really important because the longer is sits in the pipes, the more the health risks are. All you need is a layout of the pipiing system and a list of the flows at the taps in the house.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/15/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: TimothyRGinn\n"
