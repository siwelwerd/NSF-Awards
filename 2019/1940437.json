Research into bioenergy sustainability will benefit from improved understanding of goals, progress to date, and cooperation among researchers active in multiple disciplinary domains. The 2019 Bioenergy Sustainability Conference, to be held October 21-22, 2019 in Nashville, TN, is designed to bring together scientists and engineers working on the latest advances in the field. This conference will address information gaps and solutions to bioenergy sustainability challenges including land, water, climate, and socio-economic aspects. Presentations will discuss fundamental and applied research underway to support more sustainable bioenergy. Break-out sessions will encourage all attendees to share their experiences and discuss research needs and approaches. \r\n\r\nThis conference aims to provide a venue for: (1) scientific presentations from a diverse group of researchers, (2) encouraging active participation by graduate student and post docs who represent the future of the field, (3) bringing scientists and engineers together to provide an atmosphere and venue to discuss their disciplines and approaches, and to motivate new research into barriers limiting the development and sustainability of bioenergy sources, and (4) a particular focus on women, underrepresented groups in engineering, and persons with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
