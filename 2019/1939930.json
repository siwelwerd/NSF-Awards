 "awd_abstract_narration": "Soft robots are a compelling new platform for operating alongside humans in unstructured, rugged, and dynamic environments.  However, as of yet, very few soft robots are field-deployable in scenarios such as search-and-rescue and disaster response.  This is due in part to the challenge of finding ways of making soft robots move effectively. The central aim of this project is to establish methods by which soft robots can autonomously develop environment-specific task repertoires with little or no prior knowledge about their own abilities or the surrounding environment.  These new techniques will allow robots to quickly and efficiently retrain themselves when they are damaged or when their task environment changes. Importantly, this work will also establish a model for involving and developing undergraduate students as independent researchers in the high risk, high payoff field of soft robotics, thereby growing the community of researchers and lowering the barriers of entry for the next generation of robotics researchers.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project will use of Quality Diversity Algorithms to efficiently and autonomously discover effective soft robotic behaviors that allow them to robustly and adaptively move in complex environments.  These techniques will be developed using low-cost dynamically complex tensegrity-based robots. The specific goals of this research are to  produce insights into how soft robots can autonomously explore the range of their abilities, producing multimodal repertoires of behaviors that fully leverage their dynamics, and to develop methods by which these robots can robustly and efficiently adapt their repertoires in response to damage and unexpected environmental change. Throughout, this effort will involve substantial hardware-based validation and testing using a high speed, high resolution motion capture system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe nascent field of soft robotics seeks to build completely flexible adaptive robots  that compete with natural systems in terms of robustness and adaptability.  Soft robots have important applications ranging from search and rescue to biomedicine to planetary exploration.  The ability to develop robots that can quickly, autonomously, and flexibly respond to the consequences of natural disasters is a key national interest.   Unfortunately, the very properties which make soft robots so appealing also make them difficult to accurately model, scalably design, and robustly control.  As a consequence, very few soft robots are yet field-deployable in high demand co-robotic scenarios such as search-and-rescue and disaster response.\n\nThis grant provided funding to support undergraduate research at Union College centered around tackling one of the grand challenges of soft robotics: how to control soft materials in ways that exploit their complex dynamics.    Specifically, the central aim of this undergraduate-driven research was to establish methods by which soft robots can autonomously develop  environment-specific  behavioral  repertoires  with  little  or  no  prior  knowledge  about  their  ownabilities or the surrounding environment.\n\nThis research contributed to  our  understanding  ofhow  soft  systems,  both  natural  and  artificial,  effectively  and  efficiently  learn  their  full  range  of capabilities, allowing them to adapt to damage and changing environments.   More broadly, this work shed light on the complex interplay between bodies and brains in both natural and artificial systems, lending insights into how soft- bodied animals such as caterpillars and octopuses are able to operate in complex environments.\n\nAdditionally, this funding provided for the research training and mentorship of a large cohort of undergraduates at Union College - including students from historically under-represented groups - several of whom have already moved on to prestigious graduate programs and successful careers in industry.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John A Rieffel"
