 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR, will support the training of eight students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2016 - 2020.  Research is conducted at El Verde Field Station, located at El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico. The program focuses on Tropical Ecology and Evolution -- the study of plant population biology, stream ecology and aquatic insect dynamics, forest ecology, arthropod biology, and coevolution in tropical rainforest.  El Verde is the base of operations of the program and of many tropical researchers and the Luquillo LTER program.  Students develop independent projects under the advice of faculty mentors, spending most of their time conducting research and attending seminars and workshops on scientific data analysis and techniques to study tropical systems. The program also provides workshops on relevant topics, such as graduate school application process.  A responsible conduct in science component is also provided to discuss issues commonly encountered by students during their careers. Student selection is based on their research interest, academic record, and potential for outstanding research in biological sciences. The project PI makes a short list and mentors make the final selection.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 40 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. This program focuses on students with interest in ecological research and in pursuing graduate studies. Students will learn how research is conducted, many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences, and some will publish their work in peer-reviewed journals.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine student career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. Applications are accepted starting in December every year. More information is available by visiting http://reu.ites.upr.edu/ or by contacting the PI (Dr. Ramirez at reu@ites.upr.edu).",

We follow a strategy of immersing students in an active research environment, where they develop independent research projects under the guidance of established scientists. Research experiences are enriched by providing educational activities designed to equip students with the necessary tools to conduct scientific research, and, in many cases, by providing them the opportunity to study and conduct research in an ecosystem and culture not accessible at their home institution.</p>\n<p>Program activities include: (1) Independent research under the advice of faculty mentors. Examples of study areas: population and reproductive ecology, biodiversity and land use history, invasive species ecology, stream and aquatic insect ecology, microbial ecology, quantitative disease ecology, and animal-plant interactions. (2) Seminars and workshops on techniques and tools to improve student skills. (3) A seminar series on faculty mentor research. (4) Seminars on professional development. (5) Poster presentations of research results.</p>\n<p>Examples of student research include:</p>\n<p>- Exploring the importance of white rot fungi and arthropod colonization of the processing of organic matter in rainforest ecosystems ? REU student Dana Bakke conducted a series of experiments to understand leaf litter decomposition on the forest floor. She excluded white rot fungi from colonizing freshly fallen leaf litter and allowed that leaf litter to decompose. Then compared the species richness and species diversity of arthropod communities in white rot exclusion versus control conditions. While the experimental design was effective at excluding white rot fungi, she did not find significant differences in either species richness or diversity of arthropod communities, and the presence of white rot fungi could not predict arthropod community conditions. Her findings suggests that at least in short time periods, white rot fungi exclusion does not affect arthropod community composition.</p>\n<p>- Studying refugia and barriers to the spread of invasive orchids ? REU student Evan Foster studied two invasive orchids spreading throughout Puerto Rico. Current records on their distributions across the island are sparse, and their interactions with the surrounding ecosystem are unknown. He used niche modelling to identify suitable habitats for each orchid on the island and map their current distributions and interactions with herbivores, along with their distributions in the most extreme climate scenario in 2050, in order to contextualize prolonged risk of establishment on the island. He found that urban environments provide refugia from herbivores. Projections into the most extreme climate scenario suggests Puerto Rico will be unsuitable for some of the current invasive orchid species.</p>\n<p>- Exploring the dynamics of allochthonous organic matter inputs in tropical streams ? REU student Sabrina Pando-Estrada, analyzed three years of inputs of leaf litter into streams al El Verde. A major goal was to assess organic matter dynamics and the effects of two major hurricanes.&nbsp; She found organic matter inputs to be related with periods of high precipitation. Hurricanes decreased inputs, but a moderate recovery was observed after two years.</p>\n<p>- Studying bryophyte diversity in the Caribbean ? REU student Jahnyah Brooks used a variety of museum databases to compile a list of species for the Virgin Islands and assess their diversity and biogeographic distribution. He found 92 species of bryophytes (62 mosses, 26 liverworts, and 2 hornworts). St. Thomas was a hotspot in terms of biodiversity.&nbsp; Biodiversity patterns were associated with environmental variables, with elevation explaining a large part of differences in diversity among islands.</p>\n<p>One of our major accomplishments was to offer a virtual program during summer 2020, peak of the Covid pandemic. We used long-term data sets from the Luquillo LTER program for students to develop their research. Although virtual, students enjoyed their summer activities and had a productive program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader impacts</p>\n<p>We enrolled 23 undergraduate students during the project period.&nbsp; Those students were selected after advertising broadly and receiving 686 applications. Participating students had a diversity of backgrounds, including minorities and students at institutions with limited access to research opportunities (e.g. community colleges).&nbsp; Most of our students are finishing their undergraduate degrees.
