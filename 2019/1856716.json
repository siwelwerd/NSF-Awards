This conference has been held annually since 1970, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Boca Raton, Florida. The conference has grown to be the major annual event in its disciplines and plays a major role in disseminating results and in fostering collaborative work. It is not unusual for people who discuss mathematics with each other for the first time at this conference to become long-term collaborators in combinatorial research.  Its stress on the interplay among the covered topics has continued to be one of the distinctions of the conference.  \r\n\r\nHallmarks of the conference include its mixture of friendly informality and serious mathematical collaboration among participants, who traditionally include a large number of students, as well as faculty ranging from new PhDs to very senior researchers, coming from five or six continents.  There is a commitment to diversity, and wide participation by women.  All of this contributes to the strength, breadth and vitality of the international combinatorics community.\r\n\r\nThe conference website is at http://www.math.fau.edu/combinatorics2019/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

An informal problem session was held Thursday afternoon. Abstracts for all the papers appeared in a program book distributed to participants at the Conference.\n\nFan Chung received her Euler medal, and Robin Wilson received his Stanton medal, both awarded by the Institute of Combinatorics and Its Applications, at the banquet, March 6, 2019,, and there was special set of awards to Fred Hoffman, at a moving ceremony in honor of the 50th Southeastern.  Support for the conference was again provided by grants from the National Security Agency Mathematical Sciences Program and The ICA.  This year, the National Science Foundation provided a grant of $15,000, designated for student support.  The Conference awarded partial support to thirty students, totaling $13,559.86, and paid $1160 to provide ASL translation for a student participant with impaired hearing.  This came to a sum of $14,719.86.\n\nThe journal, Algorithms awarded two scholarship projects, to graduate and undergraduate winners of our best student paper competition.  An award for the best paper by an FAU student was presented by the Graduate College of FAU.  Algorithms and the Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics published special issues commemorating the 50th Southeastern.  Participants were invited to submit full copies of their papers to the refereed journal, Congressus Numerantium.  The three volumes of the journal comprised of 58 papers from the Conference were distributed in July, 2020.\n\nThe conference organizing committee of Frederick Hoffman, Stephen Locke and Ronald Mullin was aided by an advisory committee of David Brown, Joanna Ellis-Monoghan, Kim Factor, Sarah Holliday, Marc Lipman and Ivelisse Rubio.  The conference received logistical support from the department, chaired by Rainer Steinwandt, and its staff, especially Emily Cimillo and Beth Broer.  Technical support was provided by the technical staff of the CES College of Science, especially Andrew Gultz.  The Program and Abstracts book was prepared by Alex Milbrand.
