 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for US participation in the conference \"Boundaries of Random Walks and Applications\" that will be held on June 4-6, 2019 at Bowdoin College. \r\n \r\nThe conference focuses on the topic of random walks on groups, which interfaces core areas of mathematical analysis and related fields, specifically probability, ergodic theory, geometry, and operator algebras.   A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at: https://sites.google.com/view/boundariesrw/home\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
