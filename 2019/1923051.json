 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need to replace the currently used line-spoolers with actual certified winches has been a pressing need in the fleet for years. The line spoolers which are utilized throughout the fleet for mooring deployment and recovery efforts were never intended for use at sea, so it should come as no surprise these line spoolers haven?t proven themselves very sea-worthy. Line spoolers are portable winch-like machines designed for stringing and tensioning electric transmission lines on land. They are not compliant with both UNOLS RVSS Appendix B and 46 CFR. They are inexpensive, however, and have been supported through both the East and West Coast Winch Pools. The fleet urgently needs to begin replacing its line spoolers with mooring winches to meet safety standards and regulatory requirements, and to fully and reliably support field research projects carried out with moorings.   \r\n\r\nA similar proposal was reviewed in panel from BIOS as they have begun to support increasing amounts of mooring work. The Program has decided to begin this transition to actual mooring winches over the next two years. A group purchase will be recommended to purchase five winches over two years. Although the WCWP proposal specified a \"Markey\" winch, after discussions with the institution, they are satisfied that all winches could be bought from the same manufacturer and that the volume discount will make them more affordable. The WCWP will be responsible for working with Hawboldt, the manufacturer, and BIOS, as well as the ECWP to spec the correct winch(s). The WCWP will take title to the equipment so if the vessel is retired or repurposed, the winches will return to the pool. All costs, including shipping, cables, commissioning, and attendance at the factory acceptance trials for the five winches are covered in this two-year award. Year one will constitute the down payment to beginning construction of the winches and the balance will be released in year two after an annual report documents that the work is complete.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
