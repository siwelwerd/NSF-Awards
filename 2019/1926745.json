 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding to partially support student-housing and student related activities at the 2019 North American Power Symposium (NAPS 2019), a student-centric conference. The 2019edition of NAPS will be held from October 13 to 15, 2019 at Wichita State University, Wichita, KS. It will continue its tradition of supporting students through an enhanced conference experience. This year, the student activities include skill-development workshops, technical presentations and networking opportunities. Students who publish and present a paper in NAPS will receive feedback from industry and academic experts. Exceptional student contributions will be recognized through a best paper award competition. Aiming to increase undergraduate student participation, NAPS 2019 will include a separate track to highlight undergraduate student research. The soft-skills workshop is planned for the student attendees to provide an opportunity for the future power system experts to be more effective communicators\r\n\r\nThe objective of this conference is to encourage student researchers in the general area of power and energy systems to share their preliminary outcomes. This conference also provides an avenue for them to interact with industry and academic experts to further simulate their interest and understanding in the emerging areas of power and energy systems. These outcomes often become the initial step towards new research directions and the modernization of the power grid. The articles presented in the conference will\r\nbe peer reviewed original work and will be achieved through the IEEE digital databases, IEEExplore. These articles will be available to the power system community around the world. Student attendees will be able learn about contemporary issues in power systems by attending the plenary sessions by industry\r\nexperts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The conference brought 184 students, 67 faculty members, 31 industry representatives and 5 representatives from national labs together for two days. The objective of this conference is to encourage student researchers in the general area of power and energy systems to share their preliminary outcomes. Feedback from the industry experts would enhance future research outcomes of the student researchers. Also, student attendees gained substantial experience on the challenges and opportunities associated with the modernization of the power grid.</p>\n<p>225 papers were selected for presentation out of 320 submitted papers. Out of the accepted papers two papers were not presented (no-shows) and removed from IEEE Xplore submission. All papers had at least two independent reviewers. In total 39 technical sessions were held in addition to the two plenary sessions. Two of the technical sessions were assigned student best papers and one for undergraduate student best papers. This provided student authors of these best papers to share their work with more targeted audiences. Based on the reviewer rating and evaluation by non-student attendees for their presentation skills, the best student paper of the conference was selected. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to the traditional technical sessions, NAPS 2019 focused on: (i) increasing undergraduate student participation by creating a separate track for undergraduate research, (ii) providing opportunities for graduate students to participate in soft-skill development workshops, (iii) increasing industry and faculty participation in order to provide feedback to the students, and (iv) promoting presentation skills by organizing an &ldquo;elevator pitch&rdquo; competition.</p>\n<p>NAPS is a student-centric conference that focuses on attracting students from North America with minimal cost to the students.

Based on the end of the conference survey, 100% of the survey responders indicated that they would like to have soft-skill development events as a part of NAPS.</p>\n<p>To promote communication skills an &ldquo;Elevator Pitch Competition&rdquo; was organized for the first time. All the authors selected for the best paper competition were given a chance to present their work in 3 minutes to a diverse audience. Three judges, a faculty member, a transmission system engineer, and a distribution system engineer served as the judges and selected the best presenter. Based on the end of the conference survey, on a scale of 1 to 5 (5 being highest) the value of the elevator pitch competition to the students was found to be 4.39.</p>\n<p>Wichita State graduate students were an integral part of the planning, organization, and operation of the conference, an invaluable experience for them.
