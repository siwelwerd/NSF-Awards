The effort has the potential significantly advance the knowledge about quantum computing of the scientific community in general and within the areas of Computer Science and Engineering specifically. \r\n\r\nThis project will utilize free cloud-based access to a gate-based platform to provide hands-on experience with programming actual quantum hardware. Curricular material will include the fundamentals in physics and mathematics required to understand quantum computing, introductory material to the quantum field, and the programming environment for a cloud-based platform. The PIs will also develop training material suitable for tutorials at major conferences/symposia across different fields as well as online courses for faculty, staff and students. As a means to gauge success, the suitability of the material will be thoroughly evaluated statistically via surveys at the end of educational units for both classes and tutorials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
