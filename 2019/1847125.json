 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electricity distribution networks and water distribution systems are critical infrastructures that are vital for the social well-being. Although they are traditionally operated independently, they are interconnected and interdependent. The interdependency is manifested through the electricity consumption of water services facilities, such as pumping, treatment, and wastewater management. It is becoming recognized by various stakeholders that socio-economic benefits can be reaped from the coordinated operation of coupled infrastructure components and services in an urban district. The objective of this project is thus to put forth a framework that addresses challenges in resource management for coupled electricity distribution networks and water distribution systems. The potential benefits include more reliable and economic delivery of electricity and water to the end-user. Furthermore, this project supports education through enhancement of the power engineering curriculum at the University of Texas at San Antonio as well as outreach to high school students and local community colleges.\r\n\r\nThis project puts forth novel multi-period optimization methods for optimal asset utilization and resource scheduling in electricity distribution grids and water distribution systems. Specifically, the multi-phase operation of electricity distribution grids with wye and delta connection variants is explicitly modeled. Tight polyhedral relaxations for optimal power flow in distribution grids with step-voltage regulators are developed and are extended to account for other utility or end-user assets. Novel optimization schemes building on contraction mappings and penalty methods overcome the nonconvex and nondifferentiable nature of the hydraulic equations that govern water distribution systems. Comprehensive models for energy-optimal joint management of electricity and water distribution systems are developed. The physical coupling between the two networks is explicitly accounted for, while optimized multi-period pump and water tank operation takes advantage of the inherent time flexibility and can provide a form of energy storage. The developed models can also be incorporated in distribution service restoration sequences. The research is validated with a real-time power network simulator at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
