 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project aims to develop a quantum mechanical magnetic camera (QMMC) for spatial and temporal imaging of ultra-weak magnetic fields that arise on the surfaces of quantum materials. Such a camera will obtain detailed information about intricate spatial correlations, providing novel information about the nature of quantum states. The research aims to improve the magnetic sensitivity of magnetic tunneling junction sensors and integrated sensor arrays. The team of researchers in quantum materials science, magnetic sensing, and semiconductor integrated circuits has the capability of synthesizing quantum materials, fabricating devices, characterizing them with advanced resonance techniques, and developing theoretical understanding of quantum mechanisms and phenomena. The camera is intended to become a magnetic \"visual\" tool, not only for exotic quantum materials, but also for any two-dimensional active object emitting a spatial and/or temporal magnetic field profile. The expected outcome is expected to be transformative in terms of a broadened scope of high-end applications currently not available due to small field signals. The findings will advance the fields of both strongly correlated-electron matter and quantum information science. The research activities will also enable student entrepreneurs to create start-up companies that convert the QMMC prototypes into high performance QMMC products. In addition, the research team is collaboratively developing a new quantum information science course and organizing a summer workshop for graduate students and researchers in New England and beyond.  \r\n\r\nThis project brings together a multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in quantum sensing, nanoscale fabrication, synthesis and characterization of quantum materials, as well as theoretical modeling, to develop a quantum mechanical magnetic camera (QMMC), providing spatial and temporal imaging of ultra-weak magnetic fields with unprecedented sensitivity and - in fully optimized implementation - submicron spatial resolution over macroscopically large areas. The sensor is based on magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) technology. With QMMC, the research team obtains detailed information about the intricate spatial correlations and local polarization of the topological quantum states. These unique measurements provide valuable tests of theoretical predictions of quantum correlations in interacting electron matter and verify the potential of these materials for construction of high-performance qubits with sufficiently long coherence times. The key to the success of the project is to significantly improve the magnetic sensitivity of the MTJ sensors and integrate sensor arrays with dedicated readout circuitry. The research team will explore new quantum tunneling barrier materials that reduce the intrinsic noise of the MTJ and design new multilayer structure to enhance coherent magnetic tunneling. The MTJ sensors will be integrated with CMOS read-out circuits so that both spatial and temporal magnetic fields can be measured and processed. The QMMC not only allows emergent quantum phenomena to be studied in quantum materials, but also expands the applications of quantum magnetic sensors to modern metrology. The team is also developing a unique probe for the study of spatial and temporal correlations on the scales relevant for quantum phenomena. QMMC technology is a significant leap from state-of-the-art technology, representing a paradigm shift in the manufacturing engineering of arrayed quantum sensing devices. The research will expand engineering knowledge in quantum magnetic sensing devices and integration of modern MTJ metal-based cells with more conventional CMOS technology. The research team will nurture student entrepreneurs to develop and manufacture high performance QMMC products.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
