 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Southern California's Wrigley Institute of Environmental Science will host a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site that will provide eight students with a ten-week active learning experience each summer for three years. Students will spend several days at the start of the summer at the USC University Park Campus (UPC) in Los Angeles for orientation, training and project development, then will move to the USC Wrigley Marine Science Center (WMSC) on Catalina Island where they will conduct a summer research project in collaboration with faculty, other students and staff. They will then return to the UPC campus at the end of the summer to participate in a joint undergraduate research symposium. In addition to research training, students will participate in targeted professional development including training in science communication, research ethics, the graduate school and job application process, and networking in the marine sciences. Students will also have opportunities to take on leadership roles in large-scale outreach activities for other undergraduates, high school students, and the general public conducted by the USC Wrigley Institute on Catalina Island.\r\n\r\nThe WMSC REU Site will provide a total of twenty-four undergraduates with internships over the three-year period. The program conducts a national search for applicants and seeks to engage students who are from schools with limited research opportunities. Most of the funding provided supports student stipends, housing and travel to attend the program. The range of potential research projects for REU students at WMSC is highly varied with a general focus on ocean environments at the land-ocean interface. Prior REU projects have been centered around organismal biology, marine ecology, biogeochemical cycling, marine microbial ecology, biology of invasive species, fisheries population ecology, trace element chemistry, land use impacts, predator/prey studies, population genetics, environmental contamination, and organism toxicity. Through these types of research experiences paired with specific skills training sessions, students will gain an understanding of interactions between land and coastal oceans processes. This project supports national goals of developing the next generation of scientists and the scientific workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specific objectives for the 2019-2022 program were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide an undergraduate research experience fostering critical thinking and demonstrating the scientific method in a supportive environment.</li>\n<li>Expose participants to ocean science, particularly within the coastal environment, and practical applications of coastal research through an interdisciplinary lens.</li>\n<li>Offer professional and career development training to expand students&rsquo; transferable skills and perspectives on potential career and academic paths.</li>\n<li>Enhance training opportunities specifically for diverse and underrepresented participants in STEM geosciences.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Program Implementation and Impact:</strong></p>\n<p>We achieved these objectives through a 10-week immersive, hands-on research experience for 8 undergraduates each year (except 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic) selected through a competitive process, for a total of 24 students. During that time, an additional 22 students participated via supplemental funding from the USC Wrigley Institute. In total, the program impacted a total of 46 students from 2019 to 2022.</p>\n<p>Students were paired with faculty and near-peer mentors (e.g., graduate students and postdoctoral research fellows) to work on independent but guided research projects spanning a wide range of basic and applied ocean science topics. Beyond research, students engaged in weekly professional development workshops, seminars, and cohort-building activities. The program was based at the USC Wrigley Marine Science Center (WMSC) on Catalina Island, and expanded in 2022 to include the USC University Park Campus in Los Angeles, thereby offering settings for both immersive fieldwork and a rich R1 research experience. The program culminated each year in a capstone research symposium at the WMSC.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p>\n<p>The 2019-2022 USC Wrigley Institute REU program trained 24 NSF-funded undergraduates, approximately 62.5% of whom identified with an underrepresented group in Ocean Sciences, and 50% from R2 or research-limited institutions. Professional development workshops supplemented research experiences with science-based trainings, covering literature reviews, science communication, technical writing, and research poster development, as well as general professional development topics like CV/resume building and interview preparation. Weekly seminars introduced students to a wide range of Ocean Science topics and professionals, while cohort-building activities reinforced a sense of belonging and identity as scientists.</p>\n<p>The program received a 9 out of 10 rating from participants, who reported significant gains in their understanding of the research process, academic and career paths in Ocean Science, and skills development. Positive feedback included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;This is a great program that pushes students to be better scientists and better students. I have learned a lot this summer not just about my project, but also about life and life as an aspiring scientist thanks to my mentor.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;The program went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and allow me to gain new experiences.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;After this experience, I feel ready to continue research more independently and I feel like I better understand my path after graduating, which are both things that I wanted to accomplish this summer.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;I got real, intensive research experience that increased my laboratory/research skill set. I received copious support and guidance from my mentors and peers.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;I made amazing friends along the way.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since completing the program, 10 students presented their research at national scientific conferences, and the majority remain in geoscience and STEM fields as of May 2024: 7 are enrolled in Ph.D. programs in geosciences (one received the prestigious NSF Graduate Research Fellowship), 4 in M.S. programs, 7 are working in STEM professions, 3 are completing their Bachelor's degrees (one received a NOAA Hollings Scholarship), and 3 just graduated.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p>\n<p>Students contributed to innovative and current research topics in marine and ocean science during the program, spanning marine biogeochemistry, trace metal chemistry, microbial ecology and genomics, harmful algal blooms, behavior and adaptation of marine species, coral plasticity and conservation, seaweed ecology and more.
