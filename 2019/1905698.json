Unlike atoms or molecules, which derive their energy from a heat source to move around in a random, undirected manner, many living creatures expend their energy to move along a preferred body axis, leading to unusual collective behaviors such as schooling, flocking and swarming. In this research, experiments will be launched to mimic some of these phenomena in laboratory systems made up of millimeter-sized grains energized by vibrations. Going beyond the biological motivation, the research team will create grains that move in designed ways to manipulate and assemble materials.  Through this research, both graduate and undergraduate students will gain exposure to a variety of techniques and frontier areas in soft-condensed matter physics and be introduced to problems which have industrial relevance.  The PI contributes to graduate education beyond his university by continuing to organize an annual summer school at UMass Amherst entitled Soft Solids and Complex Fluids.  The PI also contributes to running an annual program for middle- and high-school teachers entitled Patterns Around Us.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nActive matter is a new arena for non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, inspired by observed collective behavior in motile systems from bacteria to insects, fish, birds and migrating mammals. In this project, the research team will go beyond biomimetic motivations, and explicitly set aside the constraints and intents of biological design to create \"active\" granular particles that can give new material function and response to granular assemblies. The particular goal is to recognize and exploit the fact the symmetry of motion of individual units can be entirely different from the symmetry of interaction with other units. The team proposes to launch experiments to study the collective mechanics of vibrated grains which rectify noise to generate directed motion. They have parallel goals of (i) exploring new issues in the statistical physics of active matter, and (ii) developing methods of manipulating and assembling macroscopic matter. The major goal of this proposal is a comprehensive experimental study of the phase diagram of a number of classes of active particles, so that light may be shed on how activity can promote or disrupt specific kinds of ordering. Through this research, both graduate and undergraduate students will gain exposure to a variety of techniques and frontier areas in soft-condensed matter physics and be introduced to problems which have industrial relevance.  The PI contributes to graduate education beyond his university by continuing to organize an annual summer school at UMass Amherst entitled Soft Solids and Complex Fluids.  The PI also contributes to running an annual program for middle- and high-school teachers entitled Patterns Around Us.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The first of these relates to the emerging field of active matter which is inspired by the collective motions of living creatures such as bacteria, birds or buffaloes that can organize themselves into larger groupings like biofilms, flocks and herds, and move collectively. In our experiments, we aim to abstract the more complicated behaviour of these biological systems with millimetre-sized particles bouncing around on a horizontal, vibrating, surface. Just like biological entities which consume fuel and move in their environment, these particles are kicked by the surface they sit on, and designed features on the surface translate these seemingly random kicks into directed motion along the particles body-axis just like a cow or a fish or a bird might move along its own body-axis. We can align the directed motion in the particle along any axis, exploiting an untapped possibility of going beyond the biological systems that inspire this field. For example, we can have an elongated object move preferentially either along its length, or alternatively, perpendicular to its long axis (think of a fish swimming sideways). We have chosen shapes of particles that pack in ordered configurations in sufficiently large densities. In our work, we have shown that endowing particles with directed motion produces significantly different order than shapes that move randomly. Furthermore, we use our freedom to adjust the direction of motion to alter the ordering of particles. By controlling motion we can create particle assemblies that spontaneously stick together in noisy environments, or march coherently in one direction. All of these have potential for applications.\n\n\nAnother class of materials was thin flexible sheets at the surface of fluids. We performed experiments in which we laid these sheets on a liquid surface and peeled them off at controlled speeds. In a very significant and counterintuitive result, we discovered that the internal forces within the sheet depended entirely on the properties of the fluids, and not on the nature of the interaction between the liquid and the sheet. In a second result, we studied the forces needed to peel the sheet away from the surface. The understanding we have built regarding the contact between a sheet and a liquid fills out a missing element in classic work on contact between (i) a liquid drop and a bulk solid, (ii) a liquid drop and a bulk liquid, and (iii) a thin sheet and a solid.. Thin membranes lying on the surface of fluids are common in biological, geophysical and industrial processes; our results are thus relevant to a large variety of settings.\n\n\nFinally, opportunities arose for exploring fundamental problems in the sedimentation of nonspherical objects. Sinking of particles in a fluid is a commonplace occurrence, and yet, aspects of this phenomena are extremely challenging to explain.
