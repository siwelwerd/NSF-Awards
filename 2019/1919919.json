 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemical Instrumentation (CRIF) programs. Professor Niya Sa from University of Massachusetts Boston and colleagues Robyn Hannigan, Michelle Foster, Nolan Flynn (Wellesley College) and Sarah Soltau (Bridgewater State University) have acquired a high resolution, scanning electron microscope (HRes SEM) with the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) capability. A SEM/EDS focuses a beam of electrons at a sample. The electrons interact with the surface to produce a visual image of the material and identify its chemical elements. These images reveal details of the material such as the size and shape of nanoparticles on the surface or surface roughness.  Such images help to understand the properties of the material. One application is investigating the use of silicon as a potentially better anode material for a lithium ion battery.  Another study is investigating titanium dioxide, a semiconductor, which is used in dye sensitized solar cells to improve their efficiency.  The instrument is in a shared use facility available to other institutions in the local region including Bridgewater State University, Wellesley College, Emmanuel College, Bard College, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Bunker Hill Community College.  It enhances the training of graduate and undergraduate students in research course instruction. \r\n\r\nThe scanning electron microscope is a powerful analytical tool for identifying chemical composition qualitatively and semi-quantitatively of various species. It is being used in a number of important research areas.  Energy related projects include investigations of silicon as an anode material for Li ion batteries and titanium dioxide as a support material for dye sensitized solar cells. Multivalent ion battery research is being pursued to learn how magnesium can be deposited from non-aqueous electrolytes. Research is focusing on the biomineralization of carbonate-based structures (bivalve and crustacean shells) as temperature and acidification changes in the aqueous environment. Thin films composed of metal particles with at least one dimension on the nanometer scale possess novel physicochemical properties which are being investigated. Potential uses are in information storage, biosensing and chemical sensing, as well as in heterogeneous catalyst applications.  Other research seeks insights into distribution and organization of metal nanoparticles in a matrix under controlled conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Upon receiving the grant, a state-of-art ZEISS Sigma500VP FESEM with advanced OxfordUltimMax100 EDS, HKL Symmetry EBSD detector, VPSE detector, aSTEM detector and supporting equipment of chillers, pumps, gas supplies, sample-prep table have been successfully installed at UMass Boston. The instrument is successfully incorporated as part of the University Research Core Facility of Chemistry Department where a systematic, long-term, instrument management plan have been established and adapted for both on-campus users (from 6 different departments) and off-campus users. Successful training sessions for faculty members and students have been effectively offered a few times per year for on-campus users, off-campus users and collaborators from nearby institutes. The FESEM has been successful introduced into several teaching components for both undergraduate and graduate courses, and such newly developed teaching components with FESEM technique has been greatly appreciated by undergraduate and graduate students. A number of research activities have been initiated and advanced with the new FESEM facility on campus. New funding opportunities for young faculty members have been greatly facilitated with the help from the new FESEM. A number of publications and student thesis (Ph.D thesis, M.S thesis and Capstone thesis), were greatly assisted with the data collected from FESEM. Research outcomes cover a wide variety of disciplines that include material science, energy science, physics, analytical chemistry and biochemistry. In summary, the advanced FESEM instrument greatly advances and supports STEM research at UMass Boston campus and the nearby institutes. The FESEM instrument facilitates new material discovery, develops innovative research, enhances collaborative efforts, brings new teaching components, and positively impacts faculty recruitment on campus. The project not only greatly enables currently funded research on campus, but also helps securing future fundings for the University.
