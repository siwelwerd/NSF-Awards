 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Helen O. Leung and Mark D. Marshall of Amherst College use high speed, state-of-the-art methods to measure the microwave radiation given off by complexes formed between two individual molecules rotating together in space.  The patterns of the specific frequencies emitted is analyzed to determine the detailed shape of the complex.  The research gives fundamental information into how the two molecules are arranged with respect to each other along with precise distances and angles. This information, in turn, indicates the nature of the forces that molecules exert upon each other.  Such forces have important consequences for many chemical and biological systems, but are difficult to separate from the larger effects of the much stronger chemical bonds.  This project seeks to provide a greater understanding of intermolecular interactions.  The research also use these interactions to differentiate between mirror image molecules that have identical physical properties but different biological effects.  The undergraduate students engaged in this research receive valuable hands-on experience with state-of-the art microwave spectrometers, sophisticated data analysis, and modern quantum chemistry program packages. Additionally, they learn how to formulate questions and design the research methods. \r\n\r\nThis project uses both cavity-enhanced and chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy to obtain the rotational spectrum of gas-phase bimolecular heterodimers.  A macroscopic, coherent polarization is induced in the free-jet, gaseous sample via a pulse of microwave radiation, which the rotating dimers re-emit at characteristic frequencies in a free-induction decay (FID).  The FID is digitized and Fourier transformed to reveal the frequency spectrum that is analyzed to provide molecular structures.  The investigation of protic acid-haloethylene complexes tests hypotheses regarding the interplay of electrostatic and dispersion interactions with steric requirements that result in novel and unexpected structures.  Through the characterization of non-covalently bonded heterodimers formed between a chiral analyte and a small tag molecule of known chirality, which converts enantiomers of the analyte into spectroscopically-distinguishable diastereomers, the project contributes to the development of a new, improved method of chiral analysis with applications across chemistry and particularly to the pharmaceutical industry.  Called chiral tagging, the technique promises to have broad impact by providing the absolute stereochemistry of the analyte and, in a background-free manner, the enantiomeric excess of a sample. Additional broader impacts of this work include the education of undergraduates who are encouraged to pursue careers in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntermolecular interactions play significant roles in chemical and biological systems and the work of this project provides a better understanding of their nature, as well as utilizing them in the development of a new method for chiral analysis.  We use two types of spectrometers (broadband, chirped-pulse and narrowband, Balle-Flygare Fourier transform microwave spectrometers) to observe the rotational spectra of molecular complexes bound by intermolecular forces, from which their structures, and hence the forces between the subunits are derived.  The experimental work is both guided by and interpreted with the aid of theoretical calculations.  We focus on complexes formed by haloethylenes and protic acids.  By systematically changing the number and type of halogen atoms in the haloethylenes and using different acids, we are able to discern the nature of the forces, which come from a competition and/or cooperation between electrostatic interactions and steric interactions, and determine how these forces change when the electronic environment of the subunits changes.  These results provide us with a strong foundation for the investigation of systems with greater complexity.\n\nIntermolecular interactions are also used in identifying enantiomers, molecules that are mirror images of each other and generally have the same (or nearly so) chemical and spectroscopic properties.  These molecules do behave very differently when interacting with a chiral molecule (one with handedness), and we utilize this behavior in our work to identify the composition of a mixture containing a pair of enantiomers in potentially different amounts.  The development of this method is important because many compounds (including many small drug pharmaceuticals) are chiral.  Often the desired therapeutic effect is obtained from only one of the two mirror images, while the other has, at best, no effect or even a toxic effect.  Thus, it is important to know the actual composition of a sample, which can be accomplished by the chiral tagging method we explored.  We discovered a number of potentially useful chiral tags, and conducted experiments to show that the chiral tagging technique allows the identification of the two members of an enantiomeric pair when they form complexes with a chiral tag.  Furthermore, we show in one experiment that it is possible to quantify with good accuracy the relative amounts of the two enantiomers present in a mixture.\n\nThe broader impact goals of this project include the continuation and enhancement of the research atmosphere in the Chemistry Department of Amherst College.   The co-PIs were able to provide undergraduate students with meaningful and significant research experience in a physical chemistry laboratory with up-to-date instrumentations and methodology.  The value of the broadband spectrometer was made all the more apparent during the pandemic when students were not allowed access to the research lab.  In this period of time (lasting well over a year), the co-PIs (who were allowed access) were able to take microwave spectra and send them to student researchers to analyze, thus allowing them to have full-fledged, substantial research experiences, albeit remotely and requiring additional effort on everyone's part.  The grant provided research opportunities for 28 students coming from diverse racial and socioeconomic backgrounds, many of them under-served.  Most of these students were and will be coauthors of talks at national meetings, such as the annual International Symposium on Molecular Spectroscopy, and on publications related to their work.  Through direct scientific inquiry, we enhance the recruitment and retention of students in science for future generations as these students improve their knowledge acquisition skills.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark D Marshall"
