 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, this Capacity Building project aims to serve the national interest in high-quality STEM teaching by exploring curricular changes and potential partnerships to increase the number of highly qualified middle school teachers in STEM fields.  The project will revise existing STEM curricula at Old Dominion University to be compatible with requirements for middle school STEM licensure in at least two of three areas: mathematics, science, and technology.  The project also seeks to continue a partnership with Tidewater Community College and pursue stronger relationships with local area schools: Chesapeake City Public Schools, Norfolk City Public Schools, Portsmouth City Public Schools, Suffolk City Public Schools, and Franklin County Public Schools. Three additional partners will also be targeted: Thomas Nelson Community College, Norfolk State University, and the National Institute of Aerospace - Center for Integrative STEM Education. \r\n\r\nIn addition to establishing these important partner relationships in preparation for development of a Noyce Track 1 proposal, the primary activities of the project will be curriculum revision and needs assessment. The proposed curriculum revisions aim to prepare middle school teachers for licensure in science and mathematics. The revision process will be applied to the Ocean and Earth Science major and refined for use with additional STEM majors. Changes will occur in upper-division science courses as well as elective mathematics courses, which will be re-designed to focus on depth of content relevant for middle school teachers. Extensive needs assessment will examine existing data, conduct semi-structured interviews, and survey a large stratified sample of high school students, community college students and alumni, and current undergraduates regarding needs and barriers with respect to pursuit of careers in teaching. The new knowledge gained by these activities will be disseminated to support both local recruiting efforts and research on STEM teacher preparation. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 mathematics and science teachers in high-need school districts and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit &amp; Broader impacts\n\nThe comprehensive needs assessment (CNA) uncovered students\u2019 rationales for not pursuing STEM careers generally and secondary teaching particularly in relation to the STEM courses taken in school settings (i.e., high school and college). Our findings suggested a need for greater awareness about STEM teaching careers and that the Noyce grant scholarships could be effective in motivating students to consider a STEM teaching path.  Interest is lower for teaching at the middle school with only 33.5% of students indicating that they would teach at that level (versus 55.1% for high school).  More than 42% of students were not interested at all or only slightly interested in teaching in an urban middle/high school in a high poverty community and 37.4% responded the same for teaching in rural high poverty community. However, more than half (57%) of responding students agreed that if they were to receive a scholarship to cover some expenses, they would be interested in pursuing middle or high school STEM teaching.  About 62% agreed that if they earned extra money in addition to their salary for 2-3 year, they would be interested in pursuing secondary STEM teaching.  This would indicate that the Noyce grant scholarships could be effective in increasing interest in STEM teaching careers. \n\nThere are some differences between college and high school students in their perceptions of math and science.   Seventy-nine percent of high school student respondents reported that they \"in general, like doing math\" compared to only 68 percent of college respondents.  Eighty-one percent of high school students reported that if they do well in science classes that it will help them in their future career compared to only sixty-six percent of college students.  Students were also asked about their families\u2019 use of technology in their careers and 92 percent of high school students reported that someone in their family uses technology extensively in their career compared to only 74 percent of college students\u2019 families.  Nearly 14 percent more high school students agreed that if they do well in engineering classes, they believe it will help them in their future career compared to college students (42.5% and 28.6% respectively).  This would suggest that efforts to increase awareness and interest are best started earlier (at middle and high school levels) when interest and positive perceptions may be higher.\n\nThere are also some differences between community college students and four-year public university students.  Sixty-six percent of community college students agreed that someone in their family uses science extensively in their career compared to 53 percent of public university respondents.  Students were asked if they do well in science classes, do they think it will help them in their future career and 78 percent of community college students said they did think it would help them compared to 62 percent of public university respondents.  Nearly 90 percent of community college students responding to the survey agreed that they believe teaching is a valued profession in our country compared to 77 percent of public university student respondents.  Respondents were asked about how most people they know value teaching as a profession in our country.  Eighty-nine percent of community college respondents agreed that most people they know believe teaching is a valued profession in our country, whereas 77 percent of public university respondents agreed with the statement.\n\nDuring the CNA analysis process, a novel statistical method was utilized, combining exploratory factor analysis, analysis of simple models, multivariate analysis of variance, generalized estimating equation evaluations under the framework of generalized linear model, and quantile regression. Using the outputs from each statistical measure, student\u2019s valuation of each STEM discipline and the interest in pursuing teaching as a career option was assessed.

See our SDSS 2021 annual conference presentation and future papers for more about this novel statistical method.\n\nThe CNA findings advance our knowledge and understandings about recruiting secondary STEM teachers and designing programs and supports for students once recruited, and more secondary STEM teachers are vitally important for advancing our society more broadly.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Melva R Grant"
