 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to create a digital archive of the \"networked ecosystem\" that documents the social capital of Black women in computing to provide resources, information, and access to potential mentors to increase the representation of Black women in this field. The research study will help develop strategies to leverage the social capital of successful Black women in computing to encourage aspiring Black women to pursue and thrive in this profession. The digital archive entitled: Building a Sisterhood in Computing (BaSiC) will serve as a resource for this population. To support the effort to carry out this research program, the investigator will engage in structured professional development activities that include summer courses in quantitative methods at the University of Michigan and qualitative methods at the University of North Carolina. In addition, the investigator will receive guidance from a research advisory board comprised of individuals who have expertise studying underrepresentation of women in STEM and socio-cultural factors that have affected them. The long-term goal of the combined research and professional development plan is to position the investigator to contribute knowledge that could increase retention of African American women in computing.\r\n\r\nThe investigator will collect and qualitatively and quantitatively analyze personal narratives of 60 Black women in computing to determine positive and negative influences on their careers. This will include a mix of undergraduate students, graduate students, early career, and seasoned professionals. Questions will include memberships in professional societies, use of technology, and other factors that have shaped their experiences, behaviors, and attitudes. An additional 350 Black women in various stages of their computing career journeys will be surveyed to analyze and document parameters that influenced their career pathways. The rationale is that evidence-based retention strategies based on social factors will be identified. The BaSiC platform will help foster a sense of community and solidarity among a diverse group of Black women who are currently involved in computing and further provide social capital for Black women interested in pursuing careers in computing. \r\n\r\nThe project is supported through the EHR Core Research Building Capacity in STEM Education Research competition that is designed to build individuals? capacity to carry out high quality fundamental STEM education research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
