 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a conference titled \"Arithmetic and Algebraic Geometry\" to be held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in the period August 5-9, 2019. It will feature talks by international experts known for their expository skills, encourage new collaborations, and serve as an excellent opportunity where junior participants can learn and meet experts in the field.\r\n\r\nThe areas of arithmetic and algebraic geometry have traditionally attracted the interest of many young mathematicians because of the depth and beauty of the ideas they offer. The purpose of this conference is to bring together leaders of various subfields within this very broad subject to explain some of the latest developments. The topics represented at the conference will include complex geometry, algebraic cycles, motives, birational geometry, derived and higher categorical techniques, rational points, and arithmetic and geometry of K3 surfaces. This conference will provide opportunities for fruitful discussions and exchange of ideas across different areas of arithmetic and algebraic geometry. More information can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/aagaa/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
