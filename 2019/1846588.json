 "awd_abstract_narration": "The?broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is on renewable electricity production by large scale utilities. Today large scale solar generation (the majority of all solar energy) is almost exclusively by large farms of photovoltaic (PV) panels made from silicon cells, as used also for rooftop solar. The research is aimed at enhancing scientific and technological understanding of an alternative approach that exploits a different, much more efficient type of PV cell.? It promises lower cost electricity in sunny climates around the world, from longer lived plants using less land. The potential societal impact is broader adoption of solar electricity both in the US and across the world, and thus reduced global pollution. The commercial impact of the project is also huge. In the targeted global market, $30 billion now is spent annually on new solar installations and an increase to $100 billion is projected. This is an opportunity for the US to re-establish itself as a world leader in solar manufacturing, of both the different PV cells that underlie our approach, and the optical and mechanical systems that are the target of this research and are key to cost reduction.?\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will explore a new approach to solar electricity generation, using advanced photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert sunlight into electricity with twice the efficiency of silicon PV panels. The innovation is in the system used to focus sunlight on the cells as needed?for highest efficiency at lowest cost. The advanced PV cells themselves have already been developed for spacecraft, but previous efforts to commercialize them for ground use have failed, because the systems needed to provide concentrated sunlight were too expensive. The research will be directed to developing, building and testing the two innovative elements critical to a complete, low cost system: 1) Small glass lens arrays used at the focus of large dish reflectors to apportion sunlight equally onto individual small cells. Existing commercial glass molding methods do not yield arrays of the size and precision needed; a new molding method tailored specifically for the task will be developed. 2) A novel mechanical structure will be developed to orient the mirrors toward the sun throughout the day with minimal use of steel, by employing an efficient spaceframe structure turning on a ground track, and a sensor-feedback system to eliminate conventional, heavy, rigid bearings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The module changes are designed to be inexpensive, with the goal of decreasing the overall cost of solar generated electricity. This outcome is potentially transformative because the cost of solar electricity is now leveling out, after PV module cost plummeted over the past decade. Plant cost is no longer dominated by PV cost, but by non-PV materials, installation, and other ancillary costs, many of which can be halved by doubling efficiency.</p>\n<p>Silicon?s conversion efficiency is fundamentally limited to little more than 20%, as is that of any single semiconductor. The approach developed and tested in key aspects by this project calls for incorporating into a standard module additional ?multi-junction? semiconductors with fundamentally higher efficiency, approaching 50%, and for improving the module mounting system.</p>\n<p>To improve efficiency, the concept calls for modifying the glass entrance window of a PV module to have a ?quilted? instead of a flat surface, and spacing it away from the silicon cells, so as to separate direct sunlight from the diffuse daylight coming from clouds or blue sky. The sunlight is focused by the quilted lens array onto the silicon PV cells as many bright points of 1000-times concentrated sunlight, where very small but much more efficient multi-junction cells are attached. The cost of the small cells used in this way is projected to be only one-tenth that of the silicon cells, per watt generated.</p>\n<p>The key enabling step developed by this project is a modification of the standard float-glass production line used to make flat PV module windows. While the glass is still liquid and floating on liquid tin, an array of gas jets blows on and quilts the upper glass surface. The process was demonstrated in the lab, with the manufacture of the first lens ever to be made of glass without either grinding and polishing, or molding.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second development undertaken by this project addresses panel mounting used for utility-scale generation, where most modules are used. Silicon PV modules modified as described must be oriented in two axes so as to face the sun directly throughout the day, horizon to zenith as well as east to west. This adds a degree of complexity to the usual mounting, which in solar farms is in one axis only, from east to west. To minimize the added cost of also tilting the modules up and down, we have developed a dual-axis mount that uses structural steel in the most efficient way possible ? by using open truss or ?spaceframe? structures. This approach halves the use of raw steel, compared to current dual-axis mounts, where the cost of steel dominates overall cost. As part of this project, we have designed, constructed, and demonstrated operation of such a structure, turning it on a concrete ground track. It worked well through over 4,000 full rotations, simulating over 10 years of in-service operation.</p>\n<p>Two provisional patents based on this project have been filed with the USPTO, covering the new method of lens array manufacture and the new approach to making solar dual-axis trackers, applicable to heliostats for solar thermal as well as photovoltaic generation. Because our approach to improving solar PV generation requires major changes to both the manufacture and mounting of silicon PV modules, it will require substantial investment before it could successfully compete in the current globally-sourced, $100 billion/year solar market. &nbsp;The next steps will need further R&amp;D, and a move toward successful commercialization will have to involve major industry players. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/13/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nicholas&nbsp;J&nbsp;Didato</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1846588/1846588_10589762_1575484654504_Spaceframetracker--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1846588/1846588_10589762_1575484654504_Spaceframetracker--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dual-axis spaceframe tracker under construction\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1846588/1846588_10589762_1575484654504_Spaceframetracker--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dual-axis spaceframe tracker under construction\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This track-mounted, three-wheeled rigid structure has half the mass of the azimuth structure of a traditional dual-axis tracker, requires no expensive slewing bearing, and disassembles readily for transportation</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nicholas Didato</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nicholas&nbsp;J&nbsp;Didato</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Dual-axis spaceframe tracker under construction</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1846588/1846588_10589762_1576278454321_Spaceframetrackerconcept--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1846588/1846588_10589762_1576278454321_Spaceframetrackerconcept--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Concept for dual axis solar tracker with half the usual amount of steel and cost\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1846588/1846588_10589762_1576278454321_Spaceframetrackerconcept--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Concept for dual axis solar tracker with half the usual amount of steel and cost\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The lower lightweight spaceframe structure turns left-right on three wheels on a concrete ground track.
