 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research supported by this award investigates the causes and consequences of interruptions in food assistance programs. Globally, multilateral organizations, nation states, non-governmental organizations, and local-level kitchens support a variety of food assistance programs. The goals of these programs vary widely. Some provide livelihood opportunities, including direct cash or voucher transfers; others focus on emergency food aid or even enhancing the nutritional value of crops and processed foods. But whatever their goals, the foundations of such program are often shaky. Dependent on mixed-source funding and volunteer labor, they frequently taper off or close completely, leaving behind questions about why they arose in the first place, why they are unstable, and what the consequences of their demise might be for households and communities. The research supported by this award addresses these questions through the lens of intensive study of a network of volunteer meal provisioning establishments in a context of economic shift.\r\n\r\nThe research will be carried out by University of Arizona anthropology doctoral student Sarah Renkert, with supervision from sociocultural anthropologist, Dr. Maribel Alvarez. The researcher has located a site in a neighborhood of Lima, Peru, appropriate for the project because it has experienced exactly the sort of change that needs investigation: the unwinding of a formerly robust volunteer system of local-level food provisioning. This particular food system was based on communal kitchens, staffed by female volunteers who provided a government-subsidized hot meal to food insecure residents. These kitchens have been closing in recent years so the researcher has the opportunity to study the entire cycle: the system's rise; the kitchens that remain; and the effects, if any, of the changes on household wellbeing. The researcher will collect data with a combination of social science methods including participant observation; semi-structured interviews with current and former volunteers, clients, and supporting institutions; archival research on the system's history in relation to shifts in the local economy; and a household food security survey. These data will document the system's rise and development, the shift from community-level food aid programs to individual household self-provisioning, and the effects of these changes. Findings from this research will contribute to social theories of volunteerism and welfare in market-based economies, and be critical for policy makers attempting to develop effective programs for food provisioning, including in the United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Amidst an economic downturn that swept across Latin America in the last decades of the 20th century, these volunteers, the socias, formed comedores populares (communal kitchens). The socias combined their resources to cook for their families, while selling meals at an affordable price to their neighbors, investing all profit in the next day's meal. In the early 1980s, the Peruvian government began opening state-sponsored comedores, providing participating kitchens with food aid. Today, the Peruvian state continues to subsidize more than 3,000 comedores in Lima. In considering the shifting politics and critiques of food aid distribution via comedores populares today, this study looks at the current state of state-sponsored comedores in Huaycan, a community on the eastern outskirts of Lima.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drawing on ethnographic research conducted between 2017 and 2022, this study finds that as state-sponsored comedores have evolved over the past four decades, they have become sites of contested meaning and significance amidst a confluence of embedded structural inequalities, conflicting sociopolitical subjectivities, and a politics of false generosity. While the state has long used the comedores for political ends, a practice that remains entrenched in today's Peruvian political practices, outside observers have blamed comedores for reproducing irresponsibility, underdevelopment, malnutrition, political corruption, and the perpetuation of systemic injustices.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These overlapping complexities have created a context in which comedores are facing increasing pressure from both the state and their communities to close, forcing socias to fight to keep their kitchens open. The pervasive critiques of comedores often distract from the underlying causes of economic injustices and put in peril the tireless efforts of comedor socias to keep their kitchens open, as the comedores continue to provide critical social and economic benefits for participants. While food aid programs such as the comedores are unlikely to upend Peru's underlying structural challenges, for many socias, the comedores remain a vital resource for ameliorating the hardships of chronic economic precarity, while also providing a valuable space of social solidarity and camaraderie for women.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/02/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sarah&nbsp;R&nbsp;Renkert</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850722/1850722_10589911_1680483852503_Cooking--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850722/1850722_10589911_1680483852503_Cooking--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"La Cocinera\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850722/1850722_10589911_1680483852503_Cooking--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"La Cocinera\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A socia in a comedor standing in front of a commercial stove, preparing lunch.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sarah Rachelle Renkert</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sarah&nbsp;R&nbsp;Renkert</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">La Cocinera</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850722/1850722_10589911_1680483956623_Friendship--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850722/1850722_10589911_1680483956623_Friendship--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Las Socias\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850722/1850722_10589911_1680483956623_Friendship--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Las Socias\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two socias prepping lunch and having fun in a comedor.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sarah Rachelle Renkert</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sarah&nbsp;R&nbsp;Renkert</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Las Socias</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850722/1850722_10589911_1680484029050_Garlic--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850722/1850722_10589911_1680484029050_Garlic--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Garlic for the Masses\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850722/1850722_10589911_1680484029050_Garlic--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Garlic for the Masses\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Garlic on a cutting board being prepared for the day's rice in a comedor.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sarah Rachelle Renkert</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sarah&nbsp;R&nbsp;Renkert</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Garlic for the Masses</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850722/1850722_10589911_1680484105936_InRoute--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850722/1850722_10589911_1680484105936_InRoute--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"In Route to the Comedor\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850722/1850722_10589911_1680484105936_InRoute--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"In Route to the Comedor\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A socias who has recently come from the market, taking food to her comedor.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sarah Rachelle Renkert</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sarah&nbsp;R&nbsp;Renkert</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">In Route to the Comedor</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850722/1850722_10589911_1680484179642_LaYunza--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850722/1850722_10589911_1680484179642_LaYunza--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The Anniversary\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1850722/1850722_10589911_1680484179642_LaYunza--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The Anniversary\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Socias from a comedor association prepare for a \"Yunza,\" in celebration of their association's anniversary.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sarah Rachelle Renkert</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sarah&nbsp;R&nbsp;Renkert</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">The Anniversary</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
