 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most fascinating discoveries in atmospheric physics is that thunderstorms may work as particle accelerators, producing intense fluxes of energetic radiation, which take different forms, such as: X-ray flashes emitted from the descending lightning channels, bursts of gamma rays observed at satellite altitudes known as terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs), and minute-long gamma-ray glows that terminate with a lightning bolt. All of these phenomena are different manifestations of bremsstrahlung emissions of the so-called runaway electrons, which are accelerated to high energies despite the collisions with air molecules. It is theoretically plausible that electron acceleration up to runaway energies (via the so-called thermal runaway electron mechanism) can happen at the tips of lightning channels where strong electric fields exist, but a number of questions about the detailed physics and its implications have puzzled researchers in recent years. \r\n\r\nAlthough the key role of runaway electrons in atmospheric electricity has been recognized, to date it remains unsettled whether runaway electrons influence the propagation of lightning and laboratory discharges. It also remains unclear if runaway electrons emitted by lightning leaders can seed TGFs. In some instances, X-ray emissions are observed on the ground and correlated to runaway electrons at the tips of descending lightning leader channels. But in some other occasions, powerful ground TGFs are detected instead. It remains a mystery what kind of lightning discharges produces the more energetic gamma emissions (instead of X-rays) and whether the mechanism involves thermal runaway electron generation. The main project goal is to address this knowledge gap with a robust methodology to infer the flux and spectral energy distribution of runaway electrons emitted by lightning and laboratory discharges. This is a 3-step approach that involves: (1) measuring X-ray emissions from short laboratory discharges that efficiently produce runaway electrons, are repeatable, and the electrical properties can be controlled; (2) developing scalable Monte Carlo simulation codes that can unveil the flux and spectral distribution of runaway electrons when driven/validated by the rich dataset collected in step (1); and (3) performing X-ray observations at the Langmuir laboratory mountain-top facility, leveraging the knowledge acquired from steps (1)-(2) to infer the properties of runaway electrons emitted by natural lightning. Additionally, the project has also an educational aim - the research team will develop a freshman-level classroom module to teach basic concepts of electrical breakdown in air via demonstrations with electrical discharges.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by NSF Physical and Dynamic Meteorology program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Figure 1 summarizes our experimental results, with panels 1a&ndash;1d showing one sample discharge, while panels 1e&ndash;1f display trends across many discharges. We determined via Monte Carlo simulations (Pantuso et al., 2022) and experiments (Contreras-Vidal et al., 2023) that a dominant source of uncertainty in determining the energies of runaway electrons in laboratory experiments has to do with the uncertainty in determining the exact gap voltage during runaway electron emission. In discharges with slow risetimes, of ~100 ns or longer, streamers will start stochastically at different voltage levels, and this will constrain the properties of the X-ray emission. We determined experimentally that the X-ray burst energy scales quadratically with gap voltage (Fig. 1f). The same experiments provided strong evidence that the emission of runaway electrons takes place early on during the streamer inception phase. On average, X-ray emissions were recorded a mere 3.5&plusmn;0.5 ns after the onset of streamer current (Fig. 1e). This finding opens the doors to the question of whether runaway electrons can affect the overall discharge dynamics (since they are present in the gap from the very beginning).</p>\n<p>Additionally, we have measured the X- and gamma-ray energy spectrum emitted by natural lightning. In the Summer of 2022, we recorded 4 lightning flashes that happened within 500 m of our instrument. X-ray data was recorded with a LaBr<sub>3</sub>(Ce) detector (2&rdquo;&times;2&rdquo; crystal) connected to a fast data acquisition system operating at 180 MHz, the same type of data acquisition system used in our group&rsquo;s lightning interferometers. This allowed us to measure the energies of individual photons, and to determine their spectral distribution. The results are shown in Figure 2. We can see that a power-law distribution describes the trend seen in the data quite well. We can also see a distinction between stepped (leading to first strokes, Fig. 2a)&nbsp;and dart (leading to subsequent strokes, 2b) leaders. Preliminary results indicate that stepped leaders emit more X-rays, including photons with higher energy than dart leaders. As a result the X-ray photon energy distribution associated with dart leader has a longer tail, extending well into the MeV (gamma) energies (Contreras-Vidal et al., 2024).</p>\n<p>A number of additional science questions appeared in the process of trying to understand streamers, leaders, lightning, and their energetic emissions at a fundamental level. Across the five-year duration of this project, these endeavors resulted in additional journal articles. Some of the key results are summarized below: (i) We have determined that bigger and brighter sprites have stronger currents and, thus, deposit more energy in the mesosphere (Contreras-Vidal et al., 2021). (ii) We measured the three-dimensional speeds of dart leaders and determined that, during their lifecycle, consistently they first accelerate and then decelerate (Jensen et al., 2021). (iii) We have performed a survey of sudden electron density changes in the lower ionosphere due to underlying thunderstorms, as measured by the Arecibo Observatory incoherent scattering radar (da Silva et al., 2021). (iv) We determined the electrostatic conditions (field and voltage amplitude) required to create extensive streamer corona discharges inside thunderstorms known as fast breakdown (Attanasio et al., 2021). (v) We performed simulations of the return stroke channel plasma properties and achieved good quantitative agreement with the temperature measured via spectroscopy (Taylor et al., 2022). (vi) We have explored the potential use of neuromorphic cameras for sprite observations (Smith et al., 2024).</p>\n<p>The most noteworthy aspect of this project is the high-level of student involvement.
