 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes (QLCI) program is part of the Quantum Leap, one of the research Big Ideas promoted by the National Science Foundation. This award is a QLCI Conceptualization Grant, which supports activities to build capacity among teams planning for the large-scale, interdisciplinary Challenge Institute projects that aim to advance the frontiers of quantum information science and engineering. Research at these Institutes will span the focus areas of quantum computation, quantum communication, quantum simulation, and/or quantum sensing. The Institutes are expected to foster multidisciplinary approaches to specific scientific, technological, and workforce development goals in these fields.\r\n \r\nThis Conceptualization Grant will develop well-formulated plans for a future Challenge Institute proposal along the theme of developing a laboratory testbed for photonic quantum information processing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this project was to develop a compelling and comprehensive vision for an NSF sponsored  institute for quantum photonic information processing.  This project outcomes note that quantum computing and networking applications are expected  to transform science, healthcare, finance,  and defense with major  societal impacts, and that the ability to transfer quantum information using photons will be a key technology driver.\n\nOne of the key findings of the project was the need for accessible infrastrure in quantum photonics and netorking that is accessible to the research community.  Through two workshops and significant interactions with multiple  stakeholders, we have developed a vision for a testbed that could be be a  national, laboratory-based resource that provides open access to a  broad range of users.\n\nThe vision includes plans to realize a remotely user accessible, highly flexible,  laboratory-based testbed platform that physically emulates large-scale  quantum network environments.  Unlike several quantum networking that  currently exist or are beingn planned, this would be the first quantum  networking testbed designed from the ground up as a user facility for external users.\n\n\nOther key findings include the need for training and workforce development.  Recommendations include new degree  programs in quantum information science and developing a testbed  technology evolution path that enables de-commissioned hardware to  transition to educational platforms.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Prineha Narang"
