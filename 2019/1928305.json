 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop Argovis 2.0, a web application for binding co-located atmospheric and oceanographic data sets so that they are easily accessible by scientists and non-scientists. The application will focus on colocation with observations from Argo floats, which measure ocean properties globally as deep as 6000 meters below the surface. Examples of data that the application will be able to help visualize include: hurricane trajectories, winds, and precipitation; these data will be combined with ocean temperature and salinity observations from Argo profiles. Users will be able to view and download data without the need to install anything other than a web browser or to directly import data into their programming environment of choice. Argovis 2.0 is intended to be both a scientific research and educational tool. The investigators envision it being used for exhibits and for classroom learning activities in oceanic and atmospheric sciences.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop Argovis 2.0, a web application for collocating atmospheric and oceanic data with Argo profile data. The application will be able to collocate two or more observational datasets in latitude, longitude, depth, and time. Users will be able to view and download data using a web browser or by directly importing data into their programming environment of choice such as Matlab proprietary programming language or open source such as Python or R. Argovis 2.0 builds on Argovis 1.0, using a standard architecture comprising of a front-end, back-end, and database. The MongoDB database is used to store gridded and non-gridded data such as the point based and finely gridded datasets. The database outputs in JSON format and is accessed by an Express.js back end framework. The backend sends requests and responds by sending either HTML or JSON data to the user. Finally, Angular is the web application framework for the front end. User generated charts and maps are built using tiled mapping and charting libraries Leaflet and Plotly. The project will serve a broad community of scientists and professors who use atmospheric and oceanic science in their research and teaching, as well as the general public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
