 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum information processing opens new avenues for next-generation high-precision sensing, high-performance computing, and reliable communications. Entanglement is a unique resource for quantum information processing. Quantum communication is the cornerstone to fully unleash the power of entanglement. On the secure communication front, quantum communication leverages underlying principles of quantum mechanics to realize distribution of keys with verifiable security, known as Quantum Key distribution (QKD). Despite appealing features of quantum communication, a number of fundamental and technical challenges need to be tackled prior to its widespread applications. This project will develop high-dimensional protocols and tailored efficient photonic-integrated circuits to substantially advance scalable, high-rate, and long-haul quantum communications, thus providing solutions to challenges faced in practical deployments. This work enables high spectral efficiency quantum communications so that communication rates can be substantially improved. As such, this project will represent an essential step toward low-cost integrated quantum communication systems that can be mass-produced.\r\n\r\nHigh-dimensional quantum communication enables transmitting quantum information in a large Hilbert space, opening promising routes for constructing new quantum error-correcting codes, building efficient quantum repeaters, and high-rate quantum-secured communications. The project seeks to introduce a new framework of quantum communications with high-dimensional entangled-qubits encoded in orthogonal Slepian sequences bases. This approach is highly robust against turbulence effects in free-space optical links and dispersion effects/nonlinearities in fiber-optics channels, thereby improving the quantum communication distance. Generation, processing, and detection of Slepian-states will be implemented in an integrated quantum photonics platform. This project will make possible the development of electronically controlled waveguide Bragg gratings (EC-WBGs) implemented in nonlinear photonic-integrated circuits as a key component employed in the quantum transmitters and receivers for high-dimensional quantum communications. Compared to fiber Bragg gratings, EC-WBGs  can be mass fabricated in a photonic-integrated circuit platform, so that quantum information encoded in a large number of mutually unbiased basis can be processed. As such, scalability is significantly improved while substantially reducing the cost. The Slepian-state sources and the photonic-integrated circuits-based EC-WBGs will be integrated to perform quantum communication tasks including high-dimensional entanglement distribution and high-dimensional QKD. This project is dedicated to 1) analyzing high-dimensional quantum communication protocols based on Slepian states; 2) developing entangled and single-photon-level Slepian-state sources and scalable processing units in a photonic-integrated circuit platform; and 3) demonstrating Slepian-state high-dimensional quantum communication systems and testing the developed high-dimensional quantum communication prototypes in a real-world quantum network testbed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifically, we devised entanglement sources and quantum receivers that allow for communication at a rate beyond classical capacity over lossy and noisy channels. We compared performances of different quantum receiver structures including optical parametric amplifier receiver and phase-conjugate receiver (PCR). The conclusion was that the PCR achieved the best performance due to its robustness against imperfections within the receiver terminal. In Year 2, we experimentally demonstrated EACOMM surpassing the classical capacity. The experiment has opened a new avenue for entanglement-assisted quantum schemes. In Year 3, we further leveraged the entanglement source and PCR to demonstrate entanglement-enhanced covert sensing, a paradigm that enhances both the performance and security of the problem at hand. To demonstrate the capability of parameter estimation, we develop new phase-locking schemes and data processing techniques. In Year 3, we also developed the quantum receiver enhanced by adaptive learning (QREAL). We experimentally showed that QREAL is able to beat the standard quantum limit thereby improving communication rates. Entangled sources and phase-conjugate receiver developed in Years 1-3 were based on nonlinear crystals and as such are very sensitive to imperfect coupling efficiency. To solve this problem, in Year 4, we implemented both entangled sources and phase-conjugate module using PPLN waveguides instead. The PPLN waveguides are coupled to FC/APC couplers thus providing significantly better nonlinear conversion compared to the corresponding nonlinear crystal solutions. Moreover, both entangled source and phase-conjugated detector are implemented using mostly low-cost C-band devices including tunable laser, optical bandpass filters, and WDM demultiplexers.</p>\n<p>We explored the control of spectral-temporal modes of optical fields through integrated photonic filters. We designed two different filters configurations, based on Bragg gratings and ring resonators respectively. To experimentally test the filter design, we developed the complete fabrication process for thin-film lithium niobate integrated photonics. Thin-film lithium niobate integrated photonics was chosen due to strong electro-optic effect of lithium-niobate. Therefore, the spectral-temporal response of integrated photonic filters can be controlled through the change of refractive index under external DC voltages. We first tested the design based on waveguide Bragg grating. By applying voltages to different sections of the waveguide Bragg grating, we can tune the spectral response for each section. Therefore, the overall spectral response can be controlled. We fabricated multiple chips with different parameters for the waveguide with Bragg grating. We did observe the tuning of the reflection spectrum with different voltages. Then we tested the ring-resonator based design. We also observed the efficient tuning of the center wavelength and the bandwidth of optical filters. Multiple chips were fabricated with consistent performance. The higher performance consistency is because of the simpler device structure of ring resonators compared with Bragg gratings. Moreover, optical filters based on ring resonators show lower insertion loss than Bragg gratings.</p>\n<p>In Years 1 and 2 we have established high-dimensional (HD)-QuCom testbed including: (1) Indoor free-space optical (FSO) link verification based on simulated channel models and available optics, and for this purpose the spatial light modulators-based atmospheric turbulence emulator has already been implemented; (2) outdoor transmission experiments using point-to-point FSO connections and retroreflectors to verify system performance in realistic FSO channel conditions. A 1.5-km-bidirectional quantum FSO link at UA facilities between the Electrical and Computer Engineering and College of Optical Sciences buildings has been established. We leveraged the INQUIRE MRI infrastructure?s high-efficiency superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors and associated time tagging instrument. In Year 3, the FSO link has been upgraded to improve overall channel transmissivity. The efficiency of adaptive optics to deal with turbulence effects on both quantum and classical levels has been demonstrated. In Year 4, we employed the PPLN waveguides-based entangled sources in various experimental demonstrations including multiwavelength entanglement distribution over turbulent FSO link developed at the UA campus.&nbsp; We have experimentally demonstrated that the multi-wavelength entanglement distribution over the atmospheric turbulence channels is possible in strong turbulence regime. We have also demonstrated that adaptive optics can be used to improve the reliability of entanglement distribution. By employing the PPLN waveguide-based phase-conjugation module, we also demonstrated that entanglement assisted communication is much more tolerant to turbulence effects compared to corresponding classical counterpart. To improve the reliability of entanglement-assisted communication over turbulent FSO channels we have proposed to perform the phase-conjugation on idler photons instead of turbulence affected signal photons and use adaptive optics. Contrary to the common practice to perform the optical phase conjugation (OPC), required in entanglement assisted communication, on signal photons at the receiver side, we proposed to perform the&nbsp; OPC on the idler photons instead. The OPC operation is typically performed on signal photons, which are severely affected by FSO channel impairments, with many signal photons being absorbed by the FSO channel. By performing the OPC on bright idler photons instead we make this process very efficient and reliable. <strong></strong></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/24/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ivan&nbsp;B&nbsp;Djordjevic</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907918/1907918_10617921_1690234754189_Outcomes_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907918/1907918_10617921_1690234754189_Outcomes_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Temporal--spectral shaping device suitable for Slepian-state HD-QuCom based on ring resonator\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907918/1907918_10617921_1690234754189_Outcomes_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Temporal--spectral shaping device suitable for Slepian-state HD-QuCom based on ring resonator\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Temporal--spectral shaping device suitable for Slepian-state HD-QuCom based on ring resonator: (top) the concept of proposed device, and (bottom) the fabricated device.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Fan & Djordjevic</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ivan&nbsp;B&nbsp;Djordjevic</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Temporal--spectral shaping device suitable for Slepian-state HD-QuCom based on ring resonator</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907918/1907918_10617921_1690235412234_INQUIRE--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907918/1907918_10617921_1690235412234_INQUIRE--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UA testbed\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907918/1907918_10617921_1690235412234_INQUIRE--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UA testbed\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">University of Arizona quantum networking testbed</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Djordjevic & Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ivan&nbsp;B&nbsp;Djordjevic</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UA testbed</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907918/1907918_10617921_1690236136645_MultipartiteentaglementdistibrutionoverFSOlink--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907918/1907918_10617921_1690236136645_MultipartiteentaglementdistibrutionoverFSOlink--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Multi-wavelength entanglement distribution\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1907918/1907918_10617921_1690236136645_MultipartiteentaglementdistibrutionoverFSOlink--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Multi-wavelength entanglement distribution\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Entanglement distribution over FSO link with adaptive optics</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Djordjevic</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ivan&nbsp;B&nbsp;Djordjevic</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Multi-wavelength entanglement distribution</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
