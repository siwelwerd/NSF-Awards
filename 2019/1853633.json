 "awd_abstract_narration": "The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), typically the lowest kilometer or two of the atmosphere, has an outsized influence on the development of deep convective clouds over the tropical oceans. The role of the ABL in the development of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), a large eastward moving region of convection that forms over the Indian Ocean, was a primary focus of the 2011 Dynamics of the MJO (DYNAMO) field campaign (see for example awards 1022899 and 1059899).  The campaign collected observations from four island stations and two ship stations in the Central Indian Ocean.  Work under this award uses the DYNAMO observations to characterize the behavior of the tropical marine ABL and its interactions with the underlying ocean.  It also seeks to determine the extent to which observations taken from the island stations are influenced by island effects which do not represent the conditions over the surrounding ocean that matter for the development of widespread convection.\r\n\r\nABL properties to be examined include temperature, moisture, stability, winds, and cloudiness, with a particular focus on the diurnal cycle of ABL depth.  The diurnal cycle is assessed from weather balloons launches that took place every three hours during the intensive observing period of the campaign.  The PI has developed a method to determine the height of the ABL from the signal-to-noise ratio of continuous observations from the wind profiler and Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS) deployed on the islands and ships.  The technique could prove useful for filling in the gaps between balloon launches and verifying that the balloon observations capture the full diurnal cycle of ABL depth.  \r\n\r\nProfiler and RASS data collected on the island of Diego Garcia and the research vessel Revelle, at the same latitude and separated by 10 degrees longitude, are compared to detect island effects.  Two of the islands used for the campaign are atolls (the second is Gan Island in the Maldives), which have minimal land area but surround lagoons with a relatively strong diurnal temperature cycle which might influence ABL observations.  Observations taken from the Revelle and moorings deployed from the ship are used to characterize air-sea interactions relevant to ABL development and subsequent convection.\r\n\r\nThe work has societal value due to the many ways in which the MJO affects weather and climate worldwide, including the development of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and extreme rainfall events in California. The MJO presents a challenge to current weather prediction models, and work performed here may lead to improved forecasts of the MJO and its impacts.  More specifically, the project generates forcing datasets that can be used for model development.  Products generated under this award are made openly available to the research and operational communities through a website at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of our project has been to better understand the nature of the most dominant influence on weather in the global tropics, the Madden-Julian Oscillation or MJO.  The MJO typically forms as massive area of rainstorms across the broad expanse of the Indian Ocean and then slowly marches eastward along the equator circumnavigating the globe in 30 to 50 days.  While the main core of the MJO resides in the tropics, its influence is worldwide.  It impacts the development of middle latitude floods, severe weather, atmospheric rivers, short-term droughts, tropical cyclones, and many other weather phenomena.\n\n \n\nExtensive research has been carried out on the MJO in the past three decades, but there are still major questions surrounding its development, movement, and weather impacts.  A central aspect of our research has been to address several unresolved issues using observations from the 2011-12 Dynamics of the MJO (DYNAMO) field campaign over the Indian Ocean.  A critical element of our investigations has been a network of atmospheric sounding systems, which are used to diagnose the characteristics of convective systems that comprise the MJO.  Several of our studies have assessed the accuracy of the diagnostic procedures themselves and shown their sensitivity to local effects around the sounding launch sites and the analysis techniques.  We have shown that even though the most sophisticated and extensive measurement systems to date were deployed during DYNAMO, there were still limitations in detecting the water content of cloud systems that prevented accurate diagnostic analysis of processes in atmospheric deep convection.\n\n \n\nIn another line of investigation, we have examined the influence of the MJO on tropical cyclone formation over the Indian Ocean.  When low-level easterly flow impinges upon the mountainous island of Sumatra, a nearly 2,000 km long island that straddles the equator, partial blocking of the flow at its northern and southern ends can generate low-level circulations over the Indian Ocean, some of which eventually develop into tropical cyclones.  It turns out that when the MJO moves across Sumatra, the low-level easterly flow is strengthened, leading to a higher frequency of low-level circulations and tropical cyclone genesis.  Many of the tropical cyclones that develop eventually make landfall in India, Sri Lanka, and countries bordering the Arabian Sea.\n\n \n\nAnother investigation has involved the study of the atmospheric boundary layer in relation to the initiation of the MJO.  Since much of the air entering developing cumulus clouds passes through cloud base, the properties of the atmospheric mixed layer (ML) are critical in determining the nature of cloud development during the initiation phase of the MJO.  The properties and depth of the ML are influenced by horizontal advection, precipitation-driven pools of cold air near the surface, and vertical motion. To address ML behavior during the initiation of the MJO, data from the R/V Revelle have been used to document the ML and its modification during the time leading up to the onset phase of the October MJO. The ML depth increased from ~500 to ~700 m during the 1-12 October suppressed period, allowing a greater proportion of boundary layer buoyant thermals to reach the lifting condensation level and hence promote cloud growth. An expression for the heat budget of the ML is developed that can accurately diagnose the ML depth, taking into account horizontal advection. The findings of the study have implications for simulating the MJO using models with parameterized cloud and turbulent-scale motions.\n\n \n\nFinally, we have investigated tropical convection over West Africa.  During the African summer monsoon, intense squall lines pass across West Africa, some of which serve as precursor disturbances for tropical cyclones over the Atlantic Ocean.  Using observations from the 2006 African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses (AMMA) field campaign, a composite of a number of squall lines was created to investigate how middle troposphere spin (vorticity) associated with these storms gets amplified.  It was found that West Africa is unique in the tropics in that there are two sources for the spin-up of the circulations.  One source observed throughout the tropics is a positive vorticity feature associated with melting of ice aloft in expansive light precipitation features that trail the squall line heavy precipitation area.  The other, however, is unique to Africa being a consequence of the deep convective boundary layer heating over the hot Sahara Desert to the north of the track of the squall lines.  The influence of this second source of midlevel vorticity is extended equatorward and combines with the storm-generated circulation feature.  The combination of these two vorticity sources yields particularly potent incipient disturbances that can subsequently develop into tropical cyclones over the Atlantic.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/14/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard H Johnson"
