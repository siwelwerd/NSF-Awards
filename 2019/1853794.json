 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses a multi-proxy approach to characterizing hurricane-derived deposits in coastal and inland environments impacted, respectively, by hurricane-related storm surge and river flooding processes. Hurricanes can impact a region by causing storm surge flooding related deposition along the coast as well as river flooding in inland areas due to heavy precipitation. Description and analysis of hurricane-induced present-day coastal and inland sediment deposits are vital for deciphering the origins of storm deposits and understanding the relative contribution of a variety of sedimentary processes in different environmental settings. By using multiple proxies, this study provides accurate descriptions of the storm deposits generated by a recent intense hurricane in both the coastal and inland environments. Results from this study provide critical information for identifying ancient storm deposits in the geological record, which advances the study of past hurricane activity in the context of environmental variability at timescales of centuries and millennia.  From this analysis of hurricane impacts in deeper time societal benefits are derived because long-term records of hurricane activity are vital for accurate risk assessment for present and future coastal communities. The project also provides educational and professional development opportunities for students and faculty at a minority-serving institution.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to assess key coastal and terrestrial environments along the path of a recent hurricane, Hurricane Maria in 2017, and to identify and characterize its coastal storm surge and inland river flood deposits. This research identifies prominent hurricane-induced sediment deposition in coastal and interior environments that sheds light on the severity and geographical variation of storm impacts in different geomorphological settings, thus offering a modern analog that assists the search for the evidence of ancient hurricanes in the geological record. Short cores to be collected from a few coastal lagoons and inland wetlands will be analyzed chronologically (using Pb-210 and Cs-137 radioisotopes), sedimentologically (using loss-on-ignition and grain-size analyses), geochemically (using X-ray fluorescence analysis), and micropaleontologically (using foraminifera and palynological analyses) to identify and characterize the Hurricane Maria deposits. Chemical elemental ratios (such as Cl/Br and Ca/Fe) and biological proxies (especially palynomorphs and foraminifera) will be used to differentiate the effects of freshwater flooding versus saltwater intrusion that represent two different types of environmental impacts. Although this research project will focus on Hurricane Maria related deposits in Puerto Rico, the research will provide new insights and approaches for identifying the coastal and inland environmental impacts of other intense storms in the continental U.S., which helps society better prepare for these extreme events in the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Hurricane Maria (2017) was very devastating for the island of Puerto Rico, causing approximately $70 billion in damages due to impacts from heavy rainfall and widespread storm surge inundation. Policymakers, residents, and stakeholders require a proper assessment of risk from these events to ensure sustainability in the present and future. This is currently challenging since reliable hurricane records begin only in the mid 19th century. Hurricane records can be extended through the burgeoning field of paleotempestology, defined as the reconstruction of storm events with the aid of proxy evidence from, commonly, sediment cores. Paleotempestological reconstructions are challenging, however, if the sedimentological signatures (i.e., from heavy rainfall, storm surge) of modern hurricanes are undocumented. When signatures from these modern events that serve as ?modern analogs? are captured and analyzed with multiple proxies, the identification of paleohurricane deposits along with their associated marine and/or terrestrial impacts is greatly facilitated. This study served as an assessment of the sedimentological signature of Hurricane Maria from sediment cores covering a large spatial area, covering four coastal sites and one inland site in Puerto Rico.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>With the aid of many methods (e.g., geological, chemical), the signature of Maria was identified in sediment cores from each study site. Importantly, we could determine the marine and/or terrestrial impact of Maria at each study site, which varied by site due many factors, such as its distance to the storm track. Notably, this modern analog signature aided in the identification of paleohurricanes from numerous sites. From Jobos, for instance, multiple paleohurricane deposits were detected from a long sediment core, occurring during an approximate time period of 500 to 2000 years before present. Due to the success in finding the Hurricane Maria signature and paleohurricane deposits from multiple sites, we are committed to further reconstructing multi-centennial to -millennial records of hurricanes for this study and future efforts.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/29/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;Martinez-Colon</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853794/1853794_10636799_1688018106951_General--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853794/1853794_10636799_1688018106951_General--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Study areas\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853794/1853794_10636799_1688018106951_General--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Study areas\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">General overview of study area.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nicholas Culligan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;Martinez-Colon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Study areas</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853794/1853794_10636799_1688017611541_Cartagenacore.JPEG--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853794/1853794_10636799_1688017611541_Cartagenacore.JPEG--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cartagena Core\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853794/1853794_10636799_1688017611541_Cartagenacore.JPEG--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cartagena Core\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Numerous fine laminations.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Thomas Bianchette</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;Martinez-Colon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cartagena Core</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853794/1853794_10636799_1688017737860_SamplinginJobos--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853794/1853794_10636799_1688017737860_SamplinginJobos--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Jobos\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853794/1853794_10636799_1688017737860_SamplinginJobos--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Jobos\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sampling in Jobos.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Thomas Bianchette</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;Martinez-Colon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Jobos</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853794/1853794_10636799_1688017900085_JobosCore.JPEG--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853794/1853794_10636799_1688017900085_JobosCore.JPEG--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Jobos Core\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853794/1853794_10636799_1688017900085_JobosCore.JPEG--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Jobos Core\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Multiple sediment layers.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Thomas Bianchette</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;Martinez-Colon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Jobos Core</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853794/1853794_10636799_1688017378004_CaboRojocore.JPEG--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853794/1853794_10636799_1688017378004_CaboRojocore.JPEG--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cabo Rojo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1853794/1853794_10636799_1688017378004_CaboRojocore.JPEG--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cabo Rojo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Distinctive sediment layers.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Thomas Bianchette</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;Martinez-Colon</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cabo Rojo</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
