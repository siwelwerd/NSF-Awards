 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds research on how renters choose where to live. The choice of residential location is a critical economic decision for households in the United States. Renters search for housing that best meets their needs given their budget. This includes considering affordability, the specifics of the apartment or house as well as desired neighborhood features. However, some renters may face discrimination from landlords and property managers. Housing market discrimination could steer renters into specific neighborhoods and distort the housing search process. This project seeks to understand how possible discrimination affects the search process. The team will conduct an innovative field experiment to see how discrimination affects housing searchers. The team will use the results to develop estimates of the social costs of discrimination in rental housing markets. The project will yield new insights to improve fair housing policy.\r\n\r\nExperimental research on discrimination on housing markets has ignored the role of housing search, making it difficult to disentangle the effect of discrimination behavior on household sorting from the effects of location characteristics. This project integrates a field experiment with an online rental housing platform with a welfare-theoretic framework that takes housing search into account. The field experiment will make use of an innovative use of supercomputing infrastructure to send inquiries to rental housing listings. By examining how landlords and property managers respond to rental inquiries, they will be able to evaluate the impacts of possible discrimination on the choice sets faced by some renters. The welfare-theoretic approach accounts for impacts of discrimination on multiple neighborhood characteristics. It is currently unclear whether discrimination disproportionately hinders the location decisions of households who have preferences for certain attributes of housing or neighborhoods: affordable housing, school quality, safe neighborhoods, or harmful pollution exposures. This project will examine whether certain types of renters are disproportionately affected by discriminatory behavior in the housing market. Finally, the project will give us more accurate estimates of the lost social welfare from housing discrimination.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to quantify the extent of discrimination faced by people of color seeking to rent on a major online real estate platform.  An experimental design was developed and implemented with the use of a \"bot\" designed by PI Christensen's lab at UIUC.  Experimental responses were collected and used to measure the extent of discrimination in the US, its consequences for exposure to environmental nuisances, and its overall welfare effects in the context of a search model.  Graduate and undergraduate students at Duke and UIUC received training in experimental and economic analysis as part of this project.\n\nOur analysis uses the following experimental samples: (1) the universe of available listings in five major real estate markets; (2) a large, randomly drawn sample of markets containing neighborhoods with high levels of exposure to toxic air pollution, (3) a randomly drawn sample of listings from the 50 largest housing markets in the US.   To our knowledge, this work represents the largest correspondence study on housing discrimination carried out in the US rental market.\n\nEach of these samples was used for a different analysis.  The first analysis (\"The Damages and Distortions from Discrimination in the Rental Housing Market\") uses formal economic welfare measures to quantify the costs of discrimination.  It combines a large-scale field experiment with a residential sorting model to derive utility theoretic measures of renter welfare loss associated with the constraints imposed by discrimination in the rental housing market. Reduced form results show that key neighborhood amenities are associated with higher levels of discrimination. Results from the structural model indicate that discrimination imposes costs equivalent to 4.7% of annual income for renters of color, that search behavior results in greater welfare costs for African Americans as their incomes rise, and that renters of color must make substantial investments in additional search to mitigate the costs of these constraints. We find that a na&iuml;ve model ignoring discrimination constraints yields significantly biased estimates of willingness to pay.  We released this as an NBER working paper in July 2021.  A revision of the paper has been invited at the Quarterly Journal of Economics.\n\nThe second analysis (\"Housing Discrimination and the Toxics Exposure Gap in the United States: Evidence from the Rental Market\") presents experimental evidence that racial discrimination constrains the housing choices of minority households with respect to major polluting facilities in the United States.  We find that Hispanic/LatinX and African American renters face strong discriminatory constraints when searching for housing that would limit their exposure to emissions from major sources of chemical toxics in the US.  When initiating a search in a market containing a major pollution source, discriminatory behavior reduces the odds of response to minority renters with racially perceptible names by 41% in low-exposure locations. Among African American renters, discriminatory behavior reduces the odds of response by 55% and by 72% for African American men.  We find no evidence of discriminatory constraints operating in the high-exposure zones of the same markets.  The pattern holds in tests between properties that are matched on comparable characteristics, in different segments of the rental price distribution, and in neighborhoods with different shares of minority households. These results imply that benefits from the enforcement fair housing policy may be larger than previously thought, since they reduce the cost of avoiding harmful exposures for African American and Hispanic/LatinX households.  This is important given that the investigation and enforcement of fair housing policy can involve non-negligible costs and that funding for these programs has been reduced over the past decade.  The results also raise a question about the distribution of benefits from toxic abatement programs, which will disproportionately benefit white residents if minority households are systematically excluded from low exposure neighborhoods.  This paper has been accepted for publication at the Review of Economics and Statistics.\n\nThe third analysis (\"Racial Discrimination and Housing Outcomes in the United States Rental Market\") reports evidence on discriminatory behavior from the largest correspondence study conducted to date in the rental housing market. Using more than 25,000 interactions with rental property managers across the 50 largest U.S. cities, the study reveals that African American and Hispanic/LatinX renters continue to face discriminatory constraints in the majority of U.S. cities, although there are important regional differences.
