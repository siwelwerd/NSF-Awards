 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching goal of this project is to uncover how language-related information is represented and\r\nprocessed in the brains of bilinguals. To do this the project will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to\r\nrecord brain activity in bilingual subjects while they read passages of text in two different languages.\r\nThese data will be analyzed and modeled using a cutting-edge approach called voxelwise modeling.\r\nThe results of this study will provide crucial insights regarding how syntactic and semantic\r\ninformation about multiple languages are represented and organized in individual bilingual brains,\r\nand how these representations are flexibly deployed to facilitate multi-language comprehension.\r\nImproving our understanding of language representations in bilinguals will improve diagnosis and\r\ntreatment of language disorders, enhance methods for language education, and advance machine\r\ntranslation technologies.\r\n\r\nOver the past 10 years the project team has developed a novel and sensitive voxelwise modeling approach for\r\nanalyzing and modeling fMRI data. This approach recovers functional maps in the human cerebral cortex in\r\nunprecedented detail. The project team will use this powerful framework to study language representation in the brains of\r\nbilingual speakers. In Aim 1 the project will compare lexical semantic information represented in cortical maps obtained\r\nduring language comprehension in bilinguals in both German and English. In Aim 2 the project will compare syntactic\r\ninformation represented in cortical maps obtained during language comprehension in the same individuals\r\nexamined in Aim 1. In Aim 3 the project will compare cortical semantic and syntactic maps obtained during language\r\ncomprehension in bilinguals who know two very different languages, Chinese and English. Together these\r\nexperiments will answer several important questions about semantic representation in bilinguals: Are the\r\nfunctional representations of semantic and syntactic information similar or different across languages? What are\r\nthe similarities and differences in semantic representations across languages? How are syntactic features\r\nrepresented and how do these representations differ across languages?\r\n\r\nA companion project is being funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany (BMBF).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
