 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to understand the principles of dynamics and control that intrinsically couple legged robots with bioinspired robotic tails to achieve agile animal-like locomotion. This research hypothesizes that spatial robotic tails can augment the performance of legged robots by enhancing their stability and maneuverability. The research will establish a firm analytical foundation that enables: (a) systematic investigation and analysis of the effects of robotic tails on the stability of highly-agile maneuvers of legged robots, and (b) development of  control algorithms for agile legged locomotion with bioinspired robotic tails. The theoretical innovations will be reduced to practice by incorporating spatial robotic tails on legged robot testbeds. This research will enable to build legged robots with agility and stability that are seen in animals to effectively and rapidly navigate in unstructured, hazardous and complex environments which will lead to faster search and rescue or exploration of dangerous environments. Additional deliverables of this project include dissemination of research results, engineering education and research experiences for students and science teachers, new engineering curriculums, and outreach and diversity initiatives for students, teachers, and under-represented minorities.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to establish a strong foundation for a paradigm shift from traditional control algorithms that only address legged locomotion without bioinspired robotic tails to resilient control algorithms that intrinsically couple legged robots with bioinspired robotic tails to achieve agile and dexterous animal-like locomotion. The research draws upon robotics, controls, and hybrid systems theory to fuse observations from nature in the transformation of state-of-the-art methods for the control of agile legged locomotion. The research will create innovations in analysis by studying the effect of tails on the stability of legged locomotion and innovations in control by creating a systematic framework to design robust control algorithms that coordinate the robotic tail motion with that of the quadruped by enhancing its dexterity, agility, and maneuverability. The research has broad societal impacts by enabling the next generation of agile autonomous legged robots to efficiently overcome obstacles in natural environments and to effectively assist, or stand in for, humans in dangerous situations such as in disaster areas. The integrated education plan involves creation of new courses as well as STEM-based outreach initiative for K-12 students, teachers, and under-represented minorities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project developed various motion controllers to coordinate the leg motions and the tail motion, for both a quadruped platform and a biped platform. This project developed five novel robot prototypes including three serpentine robotic tails and two quadruped robots with biomimetic robotic tails. The hardware tests and field experiments validated the established modeling and control frameworks and made the novel quadruped robot achieve several unique and new motions which were never achieved by a robot before. Overall, the outcomes of this project provided important knowledge on understanding the functionalities of biomimetic tails on legged locomotion and built a solid foundation for developing next-generation legged robots aiming at animal-level agility, dexterity, and versatility.</p>\n<p>Detailed descriptions of each of the major outcomes:</p>\n<p>This project established a dynamic analysis framework, including dynamic modeling, simulation, and data processing for legged platforms with a biomimetic tail. Both quadruped and biped platforms were analyzed. The dynamic analysis found that the curvature bending of multi-link tail structures do not have significant benefits compared to single-link structures for bending, but do have noticeable better dynamic performances for rolling dynamic motions. The analysis also found that even a lightweight tail can significantly affect the motions of a legged platform, especially for highly dynamic motions. The dynamic analysis platform was further extended to synthesize the design parameters of the proposal quadruped robot. The results show that the tail length and the mass ratio influence the maneuvering angle the most, while the center of mass (COM) location affects the landing stability the most. Based on these design guidelines, optimal tail parameters were determined: a tail that is 2 times as long as the torso length, and a tail weight that is 0.09 times as heavy as the torso weight.</p>\n<p>This project developed various controllers to coordinate the leg motions and the tail motion for different locomotion tasks and for different legged platforms. For the proposed quadruped robot, a partial feedback linearization controller was developed and extensive airborne righting motion, pronking gait, and bounding gait were tested to verify its performance. For the biped platform, a direct collocation-based numerical optimal control method was utilized to automatically synthesize the tail motion. For the full mobility quadruped robot, an analytical foundation was developed to design nonlinear feedback control algorithms that intrinsically couple quadrupedal robots with robotic tails for robust locomotion in the presence of external disturbances. The controller used an innovative reduced-order model for real-time planning of the COM of the robot as well as tail motions. The controller then applied a hierarchical nonlinear control scheme for the motion control where at the higher-level, an event-based model predictive control was used, and at the lower-level, a nonlinear controller based on quadratic programming and virtual constraints was used. The potential of the analytical results was numerically verified on a full-order simulation model of the quadrupedal robot augmented with a tail. The numerical studies demonstrated that the proposed control scheme coupled with the tail dynamics can significantly reduce the effect of external disturbances during quadrupedal locomotion.</p>\n<p>This project developed three novel biomimetic robotic tail mechanisms as improvements for the existing robotic tail systems, namely the RMLTail, the Rigitail, and the extensible continuum manipulator (ECM). The RMLTail solved the closure-loop cable routing problem for tail-like spatial cable-driven systems. The Rigitail utilizes rigid links for motion transmission and thus has the advantages to achieve higher speed and higher stiffness. The ECM is a novel tail-like mechanism that is capable of self-extension. All these three new mechanisms have impacts not only in robotic tail research but also in general robotic manipulators design.</p>\n<p>This project developed two novel quadruped robots that have a pendulum tail and a serpentine tail, respectively. To develop these systems, a dynamic analysis-based approach was used to determine the critical design requirements such as COM location, target motion type, and actuator size. This design framework has general meanings for developing general legged robots with a serpentine robotic tail. The quadruped robot prototype with a serpentine robotic tail has a size of the lemur animal and thus was named &ldquo;VT Lemur&rdquo;. This robot is able to perform highly dynamic motions including but not limited to yaw maneuvering, roll disturbance rejection, open-loop trot walking, and closed-loop trot-walking. The VT Lemur robot is the first-of-its-kind robot that has both an animal-like look and animal-like motion capabilities. The experiments provided solid evidences for the biological hypothesis on the dynamic functionalities of animal tails and also validated the core argument of using serpentine robotic tails on dynamic legged locomotion. The new quadruped robot demonstrated great potentials in achieving agile, dexterous, and versatile motions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/31/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Pinhas&nbsp;Ben-Tzvi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906727/1906727_10602372_1659276661938_Image1-RobotGallery--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906727/1906727_10602372_1659276661938_Image1-RobotGallery--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906727/1906727_10602372_1659276661938_Image1-RobotGallery--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Robot Gallery</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yujiong Liu and Pinhas Ben-Tzvi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pinhas&nbsp;Ben-Tzvi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906727/1906727_10602372_1659277072329_Image2-ManeuveringandStabilization--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906727/1906727_10602372_1659277072329_Image2-ManeuveringandStabilization--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906727/1906727_10602372_1659277072329_Image2-ManeuveringandStabilization--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Maneuvering and Disturbance Rejection Experimental Motion Tests of the VT Lemur Robot</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yujiong Liu and Pinhas Ben-Tzvi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pinhas&nbsp;Ben-Tzvi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906727/1906727_10602372_1659277219352_Image3-VersatileFunctions--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906727/1906727_10602372_1659277219352_Image3-VersatileFunctions--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906727/1906727_10602372_1659277219352_Image3-VersatileFunctions--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Monkey-like Hanging and Kangaroo-like Standing of the VT Lemur Robot</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yujiong Liu and Pinhas Ben-Tzvi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pinhas&nbsp;Ben-Tzvi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906727/1906727_10602372_1659277401669_Image4-Walking--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906727/1906727_10602372_1659277401669_Image4-Walking--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906727/1906727_10602372_1659277401669_Image4-Walking--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Open-loop and Closed-loop Trot-walking of the VT Lemur Robot</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yujiong Liu and Pinhas Ben-Tzvi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pinhas&nbsp;Ben-Tzvi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906727/1906727_10602372_1659277610643_Image5-AnalysisandControl--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906727/1906727_10602372_1659277610643_Image5-AnalysisandControl--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1906727/1906727_10602372_1659277610643_Image5-AnalysisandControl--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dynamic Analysis of the VT Lemur Robot and the Kangaroo Rat Model</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yujiong Liu and Pinhas Ben-Tzvi</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pinhas&nbsp;Ben-Tzvi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 5</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
