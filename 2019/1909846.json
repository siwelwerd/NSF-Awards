 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 2008, nearly 5 million Americans age 50 or older suffered from moderate to severe dry eye, and it is thought that dysfunction of the tear film plays a major role in this condition. This project will develop mathematical models that explain how parts of the tear film function, and the principal investigators will work closely with leading optometrists to achieve this goal.  One main thrust of the project will use mathematical models as a way to identify the conditions when the tear film fails, which is often called tear breakup. Computer-generated answers to models that simulate tear breakup can be used to determine local quantities in that cannot be measured experimentally; these quantities are crucial to understanding the mechanisms behind tear breakup and the causes for some instances of dry eye.  The other main thrust will use two-layer fluid models to understand the function of the layer much better than is currently known.  The lipid layer floats atop an aqueous layer; the lipid layer is a more complex fluid than water, and the aqueous layer can be assumed to act like water.  New, more complex models for the floating lipid layer will be developed: the lipid layer will be treated as a so-called liquid crystal.  We will solve models for the two layers together and compare them to experimental results.  We expect to explain some lipid layer patterns seen experimentally on the eye, and we will solve new mathematical problems to obtain these explanations.  Both thrusts of the project will advance our understanding of the tear film and dry eye, as well as advance applied mathematics. The award will provide graduate student training through research.\r\n\r\nThe PIs will investigate the dynamics of thin fluid film models that may be applied to the tear film on the human eye.  The two-layer film there has an oily lipid layer floating atop an aqueous layer. There is growing evidence that the floating lipid layer is a liquid crystal in many instances.  However, there are essentially no models derived or solved for such two-layer films.  In the first main thrust of the project, we propose to develop fundamental models for nematic and smectic A liquid crystals floating on water.  In the second main thrust of the project, we also develop parameter identification methods for tear film models through a sequence of problems that will ultimately lead to identifying physical processes responsible for observed physiological tear breakup in the tear film.  The project will draw upon the thin liquid film and liquid crystal literature, solve new models for these films, and prove the effectiveness of parameter identification methods on noisy data generated computationally.  The project will also involve optometrists to test the theories on observed data.   The PIs will combine modeling, analytical and computational approaches, together with experimental data from our collaborators, to advance understanding of two-layer films composed of liquid crystals floating on Newtonian fluids (water). Deriving these complex models and solving them on stationary and moving domains are substantial mathematical challenges.  For example, the PIs are unaware of any extensional flow thin film models for smectic A liquid crystals; we will derive and solve models for both free and floating extensional layers.  Applying parameter identification approaches to determine parameters on noisy test data for a hierarchy of film models will enable identification of parameters in these complex fluid systems.  Beyond significant results in dynamics of complex fluids, the results of the project will enable ocular surface researchers to better understand thin film dynamics and the function of the tear film.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Every time one blinks, the upstroke of the upper lid paints a thin liquid layer onto the front of the eye.&nbsp; The tear film enables clear vision and protects the ocular surface but it eventually fails, and for people who suffer from dry eye, this failure (called tear breakup or TBU) can happen much faster and with more noxious effect than for healthy eyes.&nbsp; Eye doctors believe this difference in TBU can lead to ocular surface irritation and damage.&nbsp; A major thrust of our project tries to clarify just what is happening in TBU, with the hope of clarifying its potential contribution to dry eye disease.<br /><br />We developed a deep learning method that could automatically identify where TBU occurred in videos of subjects's eyes where a fluorescent dye had been instilled.&nbsp; An example is given in figure 1.&nbsp; We then extracted fluorescence data from those videos, obtaining 467 instances of TBU from 15 subjects, and optimized the fit of mathematical models to that data.&nbsp; Using the parameters from that fit, we could deduce what happened in TBU, and compute critical parameters such as evaporation rate of water, and the final osmolarity (saltiness) of the tears within TBU.&nbsp;&nbsp; A sketch of what is in the mathematical models is shown in figure 2; the model includes evaporation of water from the tear film, osmotic supply of water to the tear film, and flow of water along the tear film, as well as conservation of solutes (salts and fluorescent dye, not shown).&nbsp; It took the work of several published papers to set up all the needed elements to create this system.<br /><br />Currently, these quantities cannot be measured directly in vivo within areas of severe tear thinning or TBU, so our method is the only way to get this data for so many instances of TBU.&nbsp; The results for all of the instances of TBU are shown in figures 3 and 4.&nbsp; Figure 3 is a scatter plot of initial strength of flow (vertical axis) vs evaporation rate (horizontal axis).&nbsp; The plot shows that TBU can have strong evaporation (green) or flow (orange), both (purple) or neither (blue).&nbsp; Figure 4 is a scatter plot with evaporation rate of water from the tear film on the horizontal axis and final osmolarity inside the tear film TBU on the vertical axis.&nbsp; The plot shows just how much saltier the tears get in TBU for the larger evaporation rates:&nbsp; the models predict up to about three times saltier than the ideal values from fresh tears (300 mOsM).&nbsp; This data, which is for healthy eyes, suggests that there is great variability in what happens within tear film thinning and TBU.&nbsp; Thus, one image or instance may not be enough to understand or diagnose the contribution to dry eye disease coming from TBU.&nbsp; The variability appears to let us classify some different kinds of subjects.&nbsp; This important information has not been available before this project, and we have begun work on dry eye subjects to collect data to compare with these baseline results for healthy eyes.<br /><br />Another major thrust of our project was to develop models of the tear film lipid layer as a liquid crystal.&nbsp; We have successfully done this for extension of a nematic liquid crystal model.&nbsp; Using this kind of material for the lipid allows us to have an orientation of the lipid molecules as a variable in the problem, and we believe that the orientation contributes to the evaporation resistance of the lipid layer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The extensional flow is like pulling taffy; the in vivo lipid layer experiences this kind of flow during the upstroke during a blink (see sketch in figure 5).&nbsp; We developed a new model that is promising for capturing patterns similar to those seen in vivo for the lipid layer.&nbsp;&nbsp; And we have preliminary results for a model where this liquid crystal layer floats on water, much like the in vivo tear film.&nbsp; We have found that the time to TBU depends sensitively on the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules.&nbsp;&nbsp; Encouraged by these early results, we need to explore the models more fully and compare them in detail to experimental images of the in vivo tear film lipid layer.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/18/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Richard&nbsp;J&nbsp;Braun</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1909846/1909846_10616085_1692365098797_FL_eye_image_for_outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1909846/1909846_10616085_1692365098797_FL_eye_image_for_outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig 1: Fluorescence image of the eye\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1909846/1909846_10616085_1692365098797_FL_eye_image_for_outcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig 1: Fluorescence image of the eye\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The tear film is visualized by adding fluorescein dye and the automated detection system selects the boxed areas for analysis.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Courtesy of TA Driscoll and RJ Braun</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Richard&nbsp;J&nbsp;Braun</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig 1: Fluorescence image of the eye</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1909846/1909846_10616085_1692365246654_model_sketch_for_outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1909846/1909846_10616085_1692365246654_model_sketch_for_outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig 2: Model sketch\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1909846/1909846_10616085_1692365246654_model_sketch_for_outcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig 2: Model sketch\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A sketch of what is included in the math model for the water in the tear film (evaporation loss, flow inside, and osmotic supply from the cornea).
