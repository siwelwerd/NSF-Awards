 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fish diversity spans high-performance swimmers such as tunas, barracudas, and swordfish that spend their entire life cruising the open ocean in search of food (pelagic species) to sluggish, sedentary forms such as flounders or seahorses that live buried in the bottom or attached to vegetation (benthic species). Much variation in body form and habit can be explained by adaptation to the habitats where these fishes live. But the effects of ecological habitat on processes leading to diversification over evolutionary time remain poorly explored. This project will focus on two groups of closely related species that harbor a huge diversity of benthic and pelagic forms (about 2000 species) to disentangle the effects of habitat transitions on rates of speciation and extinction. Understanding the factors that promote diversification in form and habit is important for the long-term conservation of marine biodiversity. Innovative image data analysis necessary to synthesize morphological variation among these fishes also will be applied to develop a fish species identification app for smartphones (FishSnap) that will be freely available to the public, expandable in the future to include all fishes. Educational opportunities will be available for undergraduate and graduate students and outreach activities in partnership with the National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC will result in a new public exhibit on fish biodiversity.\r\n\r\nRecent studies in fish phylogenetics are resolving long-lasting uncertainties about the relationships among the most species-rich marine fish groups, and opening up unprecedented opportunities to infer mechanisms that explain their extraordinary diversity. This project takes advantage of newly discovered affinities among fishes that revealed two independent clades with benthic and pelagic forms to investigate connections between genomic and morphological features in relation to their ecological habitat. The researchers will collect and compare a genome-scale DNA sequence data set of protein-coding genes to infer a phylogenetic tree for about 800 species of these two groups. This tree will be time-calibrated on the basis of carefully selected fossil data to provide a dated evolutionary framework for comparative studies. The project will also assemble a large phenotypic (digital image) dataset of curated specimens for morphometric analysis. Using state-of-the art comparative methodologies, this project will shed light on the effect of habitat shifts along the benthic-pelagic axis on the rate of morphological and lineage diversification. The integration of well-resolved molecular phylogenies, the fossil record, trait and ecological data, and comparative methodologies will provide new insights to understand the causes of marine biodiversity.",

(ii) Used the newly-generated phylogenetic trees in combination with trait and ecological data layers and state-of-the art comparative methodologies to assess how habitat shifts along the water column (benthic-pelagic axis) have shaped morphological and lineage diversification in two of these clades.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Outcomes of the first objective include newly inferred phylogenomic trees (based on 900-1,100 genes) for Lutjanidae (snappers and fusiliers; 110 out of 136 species; Fig. 1), Pelagiaria (tunas, mackerels, stromateoids, and allies; 150 out of 284 species; Fig. 2), Syngnatharia (trumpetfishes, goatfishes, dragonets, flying gurnards, seahorses, pipefishes, and allies; 169 out of 320 species; Fig. 3), and Carangaria (flatfishes, jacks, barracudas, billfishes and allies; ~700 out of 1,100 species; work in progress, but see Fig. 4 for a preliminary analysis using ~20 genes).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the second aim, we focused on examining evolutionary transitions along the benthic-pelagic axis in the water column from the viewpoint of two of these four clades: Lutjanidae and Carangaria. With Lutjanidae, we looked into convergent evolution along this ecological axis. Body shape is a strong predictor of habitat occupation in fishes, which changes rapidly at micro-evolutionary scales&nbsp;in well-studied freshwater systems such as sticklebacks and cichlids. Deep-bodied&nbsp;forms tend to occur in benthic habitats, while pelagic&nbsp;species typically have streamlined body plans.&nbsp;The recurrent evolution&nbsp;of this pattern across distantly related groups suggests that limited sets of high-fitness&nbsp;solutions exist due to environmental constraints. We rigorously test these observations showing that similar constraints&nbsp;operate at deeper evolutionary scales in lutjanids, a clade of primarily benthic&nbsp;fish dwellers that&nbsp;repeatedly transitioned into midwater habitats in all major&nbsp;oceans throughout its 45-million-year history. Our results&nbsp;show independent&nbsp;incursions into the water column by ancestral benthic&nbsp;lineages in all major oceanic basins. These evolutionary transitions are persistently&nbsp;associated with convergent phenotypes, where&nbsp;deep-bodied benthic forms with&nbsp;truncate caudal fins repeatedly evolve into slender midwater species with furcate caudal fins.&nbsp;Lineage diversification and transition dynamics vary asymmetrically&nbsp;between&nbsp;habitats, with benthic lineages diversifying faster and&nbsp;colonizing midwater habitats more often than the reverse (Fig. 1, center plot).&nbsp;Convergent ecological and functional phenotypes along the&nbsp;benthic-pelagic axis&nbsp;are pervasive among different lineages and across vastly different&nbsp;evolutionary scales, achieving predictable high-fitness solutions for similar&nbsp;environmental challenges, ultimately demonstrating strong determinism&nbsp;in fish body-shape evolution.</p>\n<p>With Carangaria our goal was to assess how the KP-G -- the infamous event responsible for the extinction of dinosaurs 65 mya -- affected the evolutionary dynamics in the group.&nbsp;Ecological opportunity arising in the aftermath of mass extinction events is thought to be a powerful driver of evolutionary radiations. We assessed how the wake of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction shaped diversification dynamics in the group. Carangaria comprises a disparate array of benthic and pelagic dwellers (<em>ca.</em>&nbsp;1100 species), including some of the most astonishing fish forms such as flatfishes, billfishes, remoras, barracudas, and archerfishes (Fig. 4). We estimated a fossil-calibrated multi-locus time tree that covers all major lineages in the group and used a set of phylogenetic comparative approaches to investigate how rates of lineage diversification, multivariate morphological evolution, and habitat transitions vary throughout the history of the clade. Analyses of lineage diversification show time-heterogeneous rates of lineage diversification in carangarians, with highest rates reached during the Paleocene. Likewise, a remarkable proportion of Carangaria?s morphological variation originated early in the history of the group and in tandem with a marked incidence of habitat shifts (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results suggest that all major lineages and body plans in Carangaria originated in an early burst shortly after the K-Pg mass extinction, which ultimately allowed the occupation of newly released niches along the benthic-pelagic habitat axis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts:</strong>&nbsp;My collaborators (Drs.
