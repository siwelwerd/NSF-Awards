 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extraordinary Properties \r\n\r\nThis Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports an integrated experimental and computational effort to accelerate the discovery of new typs of Ni-base superalloys that will have superior high-temperature creep performance, but most likely will have been missed by the traditional trial-and-error method. Ni-base superalloys are critical enabling high-temperature structural materials that determine the efficiency and carbon footprint of a wide range of aerospace and land-based power generation systems such as gas turbines. This effort is an integral part of the national efforts under the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) and the Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) initiative. For the first time, superalloy development will be led by computational modeling, mechanistically informed and validated by critical experiments involving novel combinatorial methods for materials processing and state-of-the-art characterization techniques. Because future materials R&D activities, requiring substantially reduced time and cost cycles, must integrate computational materials research with critical experiments, this research project will directly prepare graduate students to immediately contribute to the success of MGI/ICME in industry. Additionally, the training programs for researchers involved in materials development will accelerate the implementation of the new methodology in industry, resulting in increased effectiveness of the US materials technologists. Regarding educational outreach, the present DMREF program will engage undergraduate researchers as mentors who develop K-12 engineering outreach activities encouraging high school students with diverse ethnic backgrounds to enter science and engineering disciplines \r\n\r\nThis DMREF GOALI project will exploit a new design strategy that utilizes a localized phase transformation (LPT) phenomenon to disruptively improve the high-temperature creep performance of Ni-based superalloys. LPTs occur only at extended defects and are confined locally at these defects. By integrating sophisticated computational models, at multiple scales, highly advanced materials characterization techniques, and combinatorial and accelerated methods of materials processing and property evaluation, this project will (a) search the high-dimensional alloy composition space for the occurrence of LPT by high-throughput DFT Monte Carlo calculations, and validate the DFT predictions by novel combinatorial methods to rapidly produce alloys, coupled with advanced electron microscopy and atom probe tomography; (b) establish the connection between defect type (stacking fault, anti-phase boundaries, twins, dislocations and their networks) and the nature of LPT using phase field simulations with the DFT calculations as inputs; (c) quantitatively determine the effect of LPT on the operative deformation mechanisms and develop physics-based deformation models that capture these effects using a combination of the phase field method and a mechanism-sensitive crystal plasticity model, which will enable direct validation against polycrystalline creep experiments; and (d) employ novel processing routes to stabilize high dislocation/twin density microstructures by LPT, thereby providing a new strengthening mechanism for deployment to superalloys. The GOALI partner of this project, GE Research, will respond to alloy recommendations by providing high quality alloys in single crystal and polycrystal forms. Such an integrated research effort will raise significantly the state-of-the-art in the discovery and development of new superalloys and is expected to result in new science in alloy design. The focus on superalloys will have a marked impact on a broad range of advanced technological areas including aerospace, transportation and energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These superalloys have a face-centered cubic matrix and precipitates having the Cu3Au structure.In the drive to increase operating temperatures and hold times in these engines, hence increasing engine efficiency and reduction of carbon emissions, creep properties of these alloys becomes increasingly important.\n\n\nAt these higher temperatures, new deformation modes become active.In this DMREF program, we have discovered in new way to significantly increase the high temperature creep strength of superalloys by promoting the formation of ordered phases on deformation faults in the precipitate phase.This Local Phase Transformation (LPT) effect can create the ordered  phase on extrinsic stacking faults, and the ordered  phase on intrinsic stacking faults and microtwins, as proven using high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy studies (see Figure 1).A computational approach for designing alloys based on consideration of the thermodynamics of the local phases has been developed, and an example output from the model is shown in Figure 2, where compositions favoring the formation of the local  phase can be predicted as a function of titanium and tantalum concentrations.Based on this approach, a set of alloys (the TNSA series) were processed in collaboration with NASA Glenn Research Center and GE Research, and one of these alloys (TSNA-6) exhibits creep strength exceeding that of any other polycystalline superalloy, and even exceeds the strength of single crystal CMSX-4, as shown in Figure 3.\n\n\nAnother example of LPT has also been discovered for the first time to occur on annealing twin boundaries (ATBs) in certain superalloys.In the case of ATBs, heterogeneous nucleation of precipitate phases occurs.The nucleation of these phases is promoted by an  phase LPT on the ATBs, an example of which is shown in Figure 4.This preferential precipitation is unlike conventional heterogeneous nucleation on grain boundaries, and is driven by the favorable thermodynamics associated with the formation of the  phase LPT.The preferential nucleation of precipitates on the ATBs leads to nanoscale, planar regions that have low precipitate densities on either side and adjacent to the ATBs where intense deformation is promoted which is deleterious to mechanical properties.Thermodynamic modeling has guided identification of alloys and heat treatments that can mitigate the LPT and preferential precipitation at ATBs, thereby leading to reduced strain localization at ATBs.\n\n\nThe results and computational approaches developed during this program have been shared with industry collaborators and summaries presented at numerous national and international conferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/27/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MichaelJMills\n"
