 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Summary:\r\n\r\nMetallic glasses, which were only discovered about a half-century ago, have the potential to become transformative materials.  However, two things are needed before this can happen - an improved understanding of which metallic liquids can be made into glasses and an ability to tailor these glasses to meet specific demands.  There is evidence that the properties of metallic liquids near their melting temperatures are important for reaching these goals.  Near the melting temperature, the shear viscosity (a measure of how easily a liquid flows) shows a change in how it increases with decreasing temperature.  There is experimental evidence that this change is linked to changes in the atomic structure of the liquid.  One goal of this research is to develop a deeper understanding of these processes at high temperature.   A second goal is to combine this knowledge with measurements of the structures of the liquids and the crystal phases that can form from them to develop a model that predicts metallic glass formation.  The new insight that will result from these studies will be of broad interest to the academic and industrial glass science community.  A third goal is to develop a model of collaborative research that connects communities in different regions and of different sizes.  This collaborative research effort between a small Liberal Arts College and a larger R1 University will work to combat national reductions in students seeking training in STEM fields in both communities.  Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in research at academic institutions and at national laboratories, giving them valuable experience for deciding on their future educational and career paths. At the same time, the collaboration will develop a model for broad community engagement that uses modern technology to open up access routes for underserved communities to cutting-edge science and science education.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary:\r\n\r\nWhile metallic glasses have the potential to be transformative materials, an improved ability to identify and develop new glasses to meet changing demands is critically important.  Studies suggest that the properties of the high temperature liquids are indicators of glass formation.   Of particular importance is a structurally induced crossover in the properties of the shear viscosity of metallic alloy liquids at a temperature TA, which is near the liquidus temperature.  Evidence suggests that the processes that begin at TA ultimately lead to the glass transition at lower temperatures.  Predictions of the glass transition temperature based on the fragility of the liquid (determined from the shear viscosity) and the thermal expansion coefficient at TA are in good agreement with experimental data for the glasses studied.  This research is focused on gaining a deeper understanding of the crossover at TA and developing a better predictor for glass formation that is based on fundamental properties of the liquid and the crystal phases that form from it.  The experimental research will focus on quasi-elastic and inelastic neutron and high energy X-ray scattering studies of containerless-processed liquids and measurements of their viscosity and density as a function of temperature. Molecular dynamics studies will be used to guide these studies and to interpret the data obtained. The new insights developed in this proposal will be of interest to those interested in metallic alloy development as well as the broader glass community, including those working on silicate and chalcogenide glasses. These activities mirror a broad approach for accelerated materials development that is a national priority. The research collaboration between a Liberal Arts College and a R1 University will play an important role in the training of both undergraduate and graduate students in academia and at national laboratories, where they will learn cutting edge X-ray and neutron scattering techniques and computer modeling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nAccording to thermodynamics and common experience if a liquid is cooled below its melting temperature (called the liquidus temperature for alloys) it will crystallize. However, in 1721 Fahrenheit showed that under proper conditions it was possible to supercool a liquid, i.e., reduce the temperature below the melting point while maintaining the liquid phase. There is a limit on the amount of supercooling that is possible; at a sufficiently low temperature the supercooled liquid will either crystallize or change into a glass. In almost all cases crystallization occurs by the formation of microscopic crystal clusters (nucleation) which then grow to larger sizes, forming the microstructure of the different crystal grains. Glass formation is governed by several factors including the rate of cooling and properties of the liquid such as the local structural and chemical order in the liquid and the dynamics, generally characterized by the viscosity. Understanding and controlling these processes are critical for designing materials for desired applications. They were investigated experimentally and with computer simulations in the studies made under this grant.\n\n\nSince interactions with containers can limit the amount of supercooling for liquid metals, the experimental studies were made on liquids that were processed without a container. This was achieved using the technique of electrostatic levitation (ESL), where liquid samples in a high-vacuum environment were levitated and positioned using strong electric fields. Structural data on the levitated supercooled liquids was obtained from synchrotron X-ray scattering studies at the Advanced Photon Source, located at Argonne National Laboratory. These data supported a previous proposal that was based on computer simulations; the atomic ordering of the supercooled liquid with decreasing temperature is mathematically analogous to the ordering that occurs in paramagnetic materials (Curie-Weiss law). Time-dependent changes in the local structure of the liquid were obtained from our inelastic neutron scattering measurements made at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A comparison of the decay time for the local structure with that obtained from the measured viscosity (the Maxwell time) gives support to the idea of a connection between changes in the local structure of the liquid and the dynamical behavior of the liquid.\n\n\nMolecular Dynamics (MD) computer simulations were made to investigate the crystal nucleation processes in supercooled metallic liquids. The Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) is widely used to analyze nucleation data and to design methods to control nucleation processes. The CNT was first developed in the late 1800s to model condensation from a gas and was extended in the 1950s to understand crystal nucleation in a liquid. Several fundamental assumptions are made without proof in the CNT, including a compact nucleus, a sharp interface between the nucleus and the surrounding liquid, and the attachment and detachment of one atom at a time from the initial phase to the cluster by a diffusive jump. While these assumptions are reasonable for the nucleation of a liquid from a low-density vapor, our MD studies raise fundamental questions about their application to describe nucleation from a liquid. The nucleus is often not compact and has a diffuse interface. Further, instead of only one atom at a time exchanging between the liquid and the nucleating cluster, multiple neighboring atoms act in concert to join and leave the cluster together. Finally, instead of a diffusive jump the atoms from the liquid join the cluster by slight changes in orientation to match the crystal order of the nucleating cluster. These findings indicate the need for a refinement of CNT to describe nucleation from a liquid.\n\n\nIn addition to the scientific results, this research has played an integral part in the training of graduate and undergraduate students in my group. It has also contributed new material for a course in kinetics that I have taught. In the past it contributed to my outreach activities to students in regional high schools and middle schools, where I used the science of materials to provide an approachable route to the study of fundamental physical processes. Unfortunately, this activity was seriously curtailed due to the onset of the COVID pandemic.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KennethFKelton\n"
