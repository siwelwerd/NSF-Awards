The conference will be held during Jan 19-25, 2020, in New Orleans, Louisiana.  This award specifically supports students from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the mentoring workshop in addition to the POPL conference. The impact of the award relates to broadening participation in computing, providing opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in all aspects of programming languages and systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
