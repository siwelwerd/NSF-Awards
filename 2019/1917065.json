 "awd_abstract_narration": "This symposium will provide a platform for the dissemination of the current results in the field and will serve as a broad interdisciplinary forum for discussions on the current challenges and opportunities for polymer chemists, biophysicists, and microbiologists.  The key contributions will delineate the complex interplay between chemical structure, biophysical properties, and biological activity of synthetic polymers that are designed to mimic the salient features of host defense peptides.  Optimization of polymer structures to enhance antibacterial potency and reduce toxicity to human cells will be a key focus area.  Additionally, discussions on the mechanisms of action exerted by these synthetic macromolecules will further facilitate their potential future use in a clinical setting.  The event is likely to evoke keen interest to researchers who specialize in polymer science and engineering, biophysics, microbiology and biomaterials.\r\n\r\nThis symposium will facilitate establishing collaborative efforts between experimental and computational researchers, as well as bridging the gap between polymer chemists and people in the biophysical sciences.  Showcasing the advances of interdisciplinary investigators while training young scientists of the next generation is also a central theme as it provides focusing for new research avenues and fostering the development of the next generation of investigators.  Significant are made to enhance the participation of groups underrepresented in science and engineering.  The list of confirmed speakers includes 14 female scientists, 3 minorities, and 11 junior researchers (Postdoctoral Researchers and Assistant Professors).  Presentations by graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, including members of underrepresented groups, will be strongly encouraged through active advertisement and support for travel expenses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
