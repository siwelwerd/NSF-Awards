 "awd_abstract_narration": "Precipitation is difficult to predict both locally and globally. Scientists have identified many challenges in precipitation research. The International Precipitation Conference was established to bring together researchers from various fields to discuss these challenges. Scientists and engineers discuss challenges and opportunities facing the research community at the conference. The researchers develop collaborations during this conference. The conference supports early career scientists and provides training workshops. \r\n\r\nPrecipitation remains one of the most challenging variables to model and predict at local, regional and global scales with significant implications for our ability to quantify water and energy cycle dynamics, inform decision making, and predict extremes such as floods and droughts and their hydro-geomorphic hazards.  The international community has acknowledged the challenges in precipitation research and has established the International Precipitation Conference (starting in 1986) to bring together the atmospheric, climate, hydrologic and applied water resources engineering communities to discuss challenges and develop collaborations that advance modeling and prediction. Building on the previous International Precipitation Conferences, this conference will bring together an international group of scientists and engineers to integrate research efforts, discuss challenges and opportunities facing the community, mentor young scientists, and craft future directions. The conference engages and supports early career scientists and graduate students in an international collaborative environment and fosters opportunities for future research collaborations.  The conference program includes several training workshops.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
