 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for about 10 faculty from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and for about 50 students-of-color from across the nation to participate in the Annual Technical Conference of the National Association of Black Geoscientists (NABG), 4-7 September 2019 in Fayetteville, AR. Engaging HBCU faculty in professional development opportunities such the NABG will help maintain their scholarship and social capital among prospective employers of their graduates.   \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to expand the disciplinary representation of NABG to include more people-of-color interested in broader disciplines of Geosciences, including ocean (marine), atmospheric and earth sciences. A primary aim is to engage faculty and students in HBCU environmental science programs and aid their participation in a national conference of importance to placing them in the 21st Century geosciences workforce.  Despite the efforts of professional organizations like NABG, underrepresentation of African Americans in geosciences remains low. Recent assessments found that degree awards in geosciences to persons from underrepresented groups remain very low; <10% of geoscience degrees at every academic level are awarded to those with minority status, and African Americans earn fewer than 3% of geoscience baccalaureate degrees. Furthermore, most HBCU degree programs of relevance to the geosciences are environmental and atmospheric sciences programs. Students in these programs are historically under-represented at the NABG annual conference. Earlier participants in NABG meetings have continued in their academic preparation in geosciences or entered the national geosciences workforce; including 100% career advancement for students who attended at least four NABG conferences. Thus, participation of students-of-color in NABG appears to be strongly correlated with career success.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

NABG is a leading professional organization serving African Americans and Black people of other national origins within the national geosciences workforce. The conference is student- centered, and the focus of all conference activities is to advance the scientific, engineering, and educational experience of African Americans, Black students of other national origins, and other students-of-color. As such, the conference is an opportunity for students to:</p>\n<p>1) Participate in professional development workshops;</p>\n<p>2) Interact with role models from a broad spectrum of experience levels within the geosciences;</p>\n<p>3) Gain experience presenting results of research to professional audiences;</p>\n<p>4) Expand their professional network and acquire social capital within the geosciences workforce;</p>\n<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp; Share experiences as people-of-color in a profession where people-of-color are profoundly underrepresented;</p>\n<p>6) Advance awareness of NABG among students-of-color as a professional organization providing service to them;</p>\n<p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp; Increase student participation in NABG through active membership in the organization.</p>\n<p>During the 38th Annual Technical Conference of NABG, major activities related to the overall objectives of the award were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A pre-conference student professional development workshop sponsored by Exxon-Mobil related to hydrocarbon exploration. Students participated in a simulated hydrocarbon exploration project to identify viable prospects for hydrocarbon development given a variety of parameters (geological information, geophysical data, economic models, environmental constraints, etc.);<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Student professional development seminar to help students understand social capital and develop networking skills, non-technical competencies desired by employers but often overlooked in the technical educations students receive at the educational institutions; This workshop was delivered by Dr. Pranoti Asher (American Geophysical Union) and Ms. Tahlia Bear (Geological Society of America).<br /><br /></li>\n<li>All student participants were required to present research results in oral or poster formats during technical sessions of the conference. NABG professional members mentored students providing significant feedback on their individual presentations. Student presentations were judged by NABG professionals and top presenters in poster and oral formats were recognized with awards provided by NABG. A number of students were presenting at a professional conference for the first time;<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Students had many opportunities to interact directly with near-peers, advanced peers, and professional members to expand their professional network and social capital. Specific opportunities to receive mentoring and speak directly about shared experiences with professional members were provided at the opening reception, conference breaks, lunches, informal dinners with NABG members, and formal evening discussion groups.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>A tradition of the NABG Annual Technical Conference is an evening discussion group/town hall meeting with NSF personnel and NABG professional members speaking in concurrent sessions to women-of-color and men-of-color.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>As a consequence of participation, all students gained awareness of NABG as a professional society that serves them. Students connected to NABG through its social media platforms and a number of students volunteered for active roles in NABG management functions. Students also share their knowledge and experience of NABG with other Black students with whom they are acquainted nationally. The network of students-of-color who are aware of NABG has increased nationally each year that NSF sponsorship has supported this conference.

The success of these efforts with NABG since 2009 led the PI to earn additional significant NSF support for professional development of students with diverse identities. An innovative GEOPATHS project (NSF #1801569; GP-IMPACT: Professional Development Pathways to Diversifying the Geosciences Workforce) engaged over 180 students from underrepresented groups in workshops to advance their participation in geosciences. The PI was also successful securing significant support to engage other professional societies to embrace and normalize diversity through an NSF-sponsored Research Coordination Network (NSF #2037271; RCN: Geosciences Associated Societies Committed to Embracing and Normalizing Diversity (Geosciences ASCEND). Over the next two years, lessons learned from NSF support for NABG will be leveraged to push cultural change toward greater participation and inclusion of diverse identities many additional geosciences-oriented professional societies. These efforts benefitted from and are a direct consequence of NSF support for the Annual Technical Conference of NABG.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/03/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stephen&nbsp;K&nbsp;Boss</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1935782/1935782_10619409_1667172258201_NABG2019KeynotePresentation-BossandKvamme4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1935782/1935782_10619409_1667172258201_NABG2019KeynotePresentation-BossandKvamme4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Gender Balance of NABG Student Participants\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1935782/1935782_10619409_1667172258201_NABG2019KeynotePresentation-BossandKvamme4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Gender Balance of NABG Student Participants\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Graph showing the gender balance of students participating at the NABG Annual Technical Conference, 2006-2020.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Stephen K.
