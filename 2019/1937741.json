 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ProQual Institute (PQI) is designed to implement a novel, problem-led, research quality-focused approach to developing STEM education research capacity. The approach starts with the problem, idea, or general topic of interest, and researchers are then guided to identify and visually map a \"social reality\" of interest to articulate clear and purposeful research questions and to inform a coherent use of theoretical frameworks to undergird the study. Based on understanding the scope and nature of the research object, participants will be guided to explore appropriate methodological frameworks and methods that can be used to investigate that social reality and answer the research questions. The advantage of this concept is that by understanding the specific roles theories and methodologies play in a study, these frameworks can be more purposefully and productively used by novice educational researchers to conceptualize and empirically investigate the social reality of interest. \r\n\r\nThe Institute will design and implement six week-long Summer/Winter Schools for 125 diverse participants who will (1) gain an understanding of core ontological and epistemological differences between STEM and education research, (2) learn how to empirically investigate a \"social reality\" of interest by selecting and using appropriate theoretical and methodological frameworks and research methods, and (3) acquire an appreciation for incorporating research quality considerations throughout the duration of qualitative and mixed methods educational research projects.  The design of the Summer/Winter Schools will be informed by constructivist and situated/experiential learning theories. The Institute also will create and manage a virtual community of PQI participants to provide ongoing support after completion of the one-week, face-to-face program and evaluate the impact of the PQI on participants' self-efficacy as qualitative and mixed-methods researchers. The project will help to broaden and deepen the contributions that STEM education research can make to fundamental understandings of STEM education.\r\n\r\nthe project is supported through the EHR Core Research Building Capacity in STEM Education Research competition that is designed to build individuals' capacity to carry out high quality fundamental STEM education research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe ProQual Institute (PQI) for Research Methods in STEM Education (NSF #1937741) was a five-year, $1 million National Science Foundation (NSF) BCSER Institute for Methods and Practices grant. The PQIs goal was to expand the community of scholars who have the skills to conduct high-quality qualitative and mixed methods research in STEM education. The team achieved this goal by initiating a 9-week, intensive, online course that introduced participants to the ProQual Approach to research design. The ProQual Approach is a novel approach to scoping and conducting educational research that is rooted in specific problems and integrates research quality considerations into every step of the process (see attached figure). The team supplemented this course with a follow-up research incubator and participant-led communities of practice, both of which gave participants an opportunity to utilize their learning for real-world research applications.\r\n\n\nDirect participant outcomes: The PQI team trained three cohorts totaling 48 STEM scholars in the conduct of qualitative and mixed methods educational research (Spring 2021, Fall 2021, Spring 2022). Most of these participants were discipline-based STEM faculty who had little to no prior experience with qualitative methods or educational research. Fourteen of these participants have been collectively awarded 25 NSF grants totaling over $23 million since participating in the PQI. Twelve of these projects (from eight alumni, totaling $6.2 million) are research grants that feature a strong focus on interpretive research methods.\r\n\n\nThe PQI team hired external evaluators to assess participant perceptions of the PQI, and outcomes from participating in the PQI. Participants strongly agreed that the time they invested in the PQI was worth it and that the training helped them grow as academics. In addition, they strongly agreed that their knowledge of and comfort level using qualitative research improved as a result of the training. Further, many participants reported an increase in research collaborations and grant submissions following the PQI. They also reported engaging in more qualitative research, collaboration, and professional development activities as a result of the training.\r\n\n\nPropagation & material outcomes: The team was invested in propagating the ProQual Approach to research design beyond the three PQI cohorts trained as part of this grant. In Fall 2022, the original PIs of the grant left their home institution to start a small business that now conducts the PQI annually using a fee-for-service model. The remaining PIs then focused on further propagating the ProQual Approach to conference venues, conducting two workshops catered toward (1) STEM faculty and (2) STEM faculty developers. Finally, the original PIs successfully secured a book contract with Routledge to publish a methods book on the ProQual Approach. The book, titled Interpretive Research Design, is slated for release in early 2026.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/21/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JohnRayMorelock\n"
