 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemical Instrumentation (CRIF) programs.   Professor Gregory McManus from Florida Gulf Coast University and colleagues Arsalan Mirjafari, Gregory Boyce, Daniel Paull and Xiaofei Zhang are acquiring a single crystal X-ray diffractometer. A diffractometer is a powerful tool used to determine the detailed structures of crystalline chemical compounds. X-rays are passed through a crystal of interest and a diffraction pattern is produced. The pattern is analyzed to obtain the microscopic structure, that is, the distances and angles between atoms in the material.  This structural data provides insight on the properties and possible uses of materials.  The researchers are investigating materials that can be used to store gases, such as methane or hydrogen for fuel applications.  Another investigation focuses on electrode materials for energy storage devices such as the lithium ion battery.   The diffractometer supports a network of chemistry faculty committed to undergraduate research and education in south Florida including: Florida Gulf Coast University, Florida Southern University, New College of Florida, Ave Maria University, St. Thomas University and Barry University.  The instrument is used to train undergraduate students in research.  The instrument is also used in lecture and laboratory courses preparing students for the modern workforce.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of a single crystal x-ray diffractometer at Florida Gulf Coast University is used to support a wide variety of research projects including the synthesis of metal-organic materials for gas adsorption applications and the development of low-melting ionic liquids with high crystallinity which can be used as solvents in organic synthesis and separations.  Metal-organic framework systems are being studied for possible development as lithium-ion battery electrode materials.  The diffractometer is used to investigate the structure of palladium catalysts for possible use in synthesizing bioactive natural products.  Serpentine, a silicate mineral with three different types of crystals called polymorphs, is under study as a material for mineral-carbon dioxide sequestration. The diffractometer is used in studies to identify which polymorph is present in various samples.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
