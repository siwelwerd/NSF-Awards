 "awd_abstract_narration": "Materials formed from particles are often handled in the fluid state, such as cement and concrete. These particle-laden fluids have complex flow properties, and understanding the basis for this behavior is critical to design and control of the particle interactions that are responsible for the properties. The surface interactions are also the controlling factor in the behavior of liquid-saturated soils. In the geotechnical context, controlling the interactions is not feasible, but understanding and predicting behavior is especially important. This project seeks to explain the behavior of flowing materials that exhibit very strong property changes. The focus is on suspensions with a high concentration of solid particles in a liquid. These materials often shear thicken, meaning drastically increase their viscosity, such as in cornstarch suspensions in water. This project will use simulation and theoretical methods to examine how the particle forces and surface shape cause shear thickening. Computer simulation models the forces of interaction between the particles and solves for their motion. From the forces and the particle velocities, the flow properties such as the viscosity can be determined, and these are validated against experiments. A set of theoretical tools is applied to describe the forces in the material and how they are connected in a network, much like the connections in a fishnet. The overall goal of the project is to establish a theoretical framework allowing prediction of the flow properties from a knowledge of the basic forces, thus allowing better design in engineering contexts and prediction in geophysical contexts. The team will work with industrial partners in the cement and concrete sector to use the understanding toward design of additives that modify flow behavior while retaining desired properties in the flowing and solid material. \r\n\r\nUsing discrete-particle simulation and statistical mechanical theory, the goal of this project is to develop a statistical mechanical framework that describes the basis for shear thickening and jamming in highly-concentrated suspensions of solid particles in liquids. The contributions of this work will advance the statistical mechanical framework for nonequilibrium suspensions, allowing better ability to predict behavior at the macroscopic scale from a knowledge of the particle interactions. A simulation tool in its established and validated form will be used to explore the nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) ensemble of shear-thickening suspensions under constraints on stress, shear rate, and volume fraction. The ensemble data from simulation will be explored by several theoretical tools, including network theory to establish a structure-property framework appropriate for dense suspensions that approach the jamming condition. A machine learning approach will be applied to advance methods previously developed by the team for prediction of the probability of the stress state based on the microscopic force interactions. Methods from large deviation theory will be used as a framework for describing the fluctuations of properties in NESS ensemble. The simulation method will also be advanced by systematically considering the role of size distribution and particle surface complexity. In addition to simple shear, oscillatory shearing and more complex flow protocols, in which an orthogonal oscillatory component is superimposed on simple shear, will be developed and the results explored by the noted theoretical tools. The research will engage undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral researchers. The team will prepare technical society short courses and engage in STEM outreach to expose materials physics to K-12 students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project had the goal of developing understanding of the flow behaviors of mixtures of solid particles in a liquid, under conditions where the particles are highly concentrated, or in the usual terminology dense suspensions. This means that the particle loading of the mixture is close to the level that will make it unable to flow, which is known as being jammed. This condition can be envisioned as being reached in two steps, first by taking just particles in a cup, and then adding liquid until it just fills all the empty space between the particles. At this point all the contacts between the particles are still present, as they were in the dry state, so in a second step one adds just a bit more liquid and now stirs the mixture so the liquid can reach all the gaps to create very thin films. Now the mixture can flow, even if it resists flow very strongly, meaning it has a large viscosity, and this project addresses conditions when flow causes the gaps to close to create contact networks  this leads to extreme changes in the resistance to flow, which can be seen by mixing cornstarch and water in about equal masses and stirring slowly and then more rapidly. The viscosity can grow very quickly, in what is known as continuous or discontinuous shear thickening (CST or DST) and the material can even stop flowing or shear jam (SJ).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether there are contacts between particles and it can stand under some weight, as in a sand dune or sand castle, or these are opened and a film of liquid lubricates the surfaces to allow the mixture to flow and slump (as would eventually happen if water is slowly added to a sandcastle), is a basic science issue. It is an issue of importance in many industrial materials: including cement and concrete or ceramics, or foodstuffs such as milk chocolate or cookie dough. Avoiding the jamming condition while processing, but maintaining the very high solids loading when the liquid either dries or undergoes a chemical reaction to give the critical end-use properties (holding up a structure in the case of concrete), requires careful tuning of the liquid and particle surface properties. This project added significantly to understanding of the surface interaction effects, from the perspective of the development of flow-induced networks driven by the flow. The work showed that the networks under weak and strong flow (low and high stirring, or shear rate) are very different, developing from no contacts through weak strings, to a dense well-connected network in all directions. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe studies in this project developed two aspects of the understanding, one is about how the flow causes the gaps to close, which is a microscopic question, as it considers the factors in the gap between two particles. Here, flow pushes the particles toward one another, while the liquid is squeezed out, and other forces (for example, due to a layer of polymer added to cushion interactions of cement particles in concrete, or due to charges that repel one another on small glass beads in water) may help hold the surfaces apart. The conditions needed to cause the contacts for different forces between the particles were studied, and the influence of the particle size distribution was considered by taking mixtures of small and large particles (radius differing by a ratio of two or four, for example). Using a computer simulation tool developed in the group, this allowed us to determine the second aspect, which is how the surface forces between particles and the different sizes changed the way the material properties at the macroscopic scale changed  this is the level of description used in practical application. Such pragmatic progress was made based on the way the material behaves as it approaches the jamming condition, which is known as scaling, and requires understanding of the statistical distribution of the structures in the material. The work in this project showed, really. For the first time, that such approaches that had been used for the behavior of systems that are not driven to flow (for example, the freezing or boiling of water, known as thermophysical or thermodynamic properties) can be applied to flowing systems.

Exploring the validity of this hypothesis is considered as a future direction of research opened by this project.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JeffreyFMorris\n"
