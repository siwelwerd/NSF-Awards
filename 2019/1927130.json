 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multi-messenger astronomy, using electromagnetic radiation (radio waves, visible light, X-rays, gamma rays), neutrinos, and gravitational waves, is providing unprecedented observations of extreme astrophysical environments, such as supernovae and merging neutron stars. The diverse range of nuclear and astrophysics that needs to be synthesized to answer open questions about the universe cannot be obtained by a single country.  The International Research Network for Nuclear Astrophysics (IReNA) project connects research networks and capabilities across disciplines and geographic boundaries to advance understanding of the origin of chemical elements and the nature of dense nuclear matter.  This network of networks links the U.S. Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics Center for the Evolution of Elements (JINA-CEE) with similar undertakings in Europe (ChETEC), Japan (UKAKUREN), Germany (EMMI and The Milky Way system), and the international NuGRID network.  IReNA creates the communication channels and collaborative structures needed for rapid scientific response to new multi-messenger discoveries.  Exchange programs, innovative workshops, and retreats will foster network communication and training of the next generation of scientists.  \r\n\r\nMulti-messenger astronomical observation of supernovae and merging neutron stars is leading to a better understanding of and further questions on the origin of chemical elements and the physics of dense nuclear matter. For multi-messenger data to become true windows on the universe, an unprecedented amount of astrophysics and nuclear physics associated with the various messengers and their interactions must be understood. The IReNA project brings together U.S. and international networks with complementary capabilities to exchange and synthesize data, models, theory, and expertise in astrophysics and nuclear physics. The research goals are to advance our understanding of element formation in stars, stellar explosions, and neutron star mergers through new nuclear physics experiments, nuclear theory, advanced computational modeling, and new observations of the distribution of elements in stars across our Galaxy.   The expanded collaborations will enable synthesis and exchange of data sets across international communities and expand capabilities far beyond what would be possible by any individual network.\r\n\r\nThe Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) program is designed to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and prepare the next generation of U.S. researchers for multiteam international collaborations.  The AccelNet program supports strategic linkages among U.S. research networks and complementary networks abroad that will leverage research and educational resources to tackle grand scientific challenges that require significant coordinated international efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
