 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists, leaves open many questions about the universe. These include why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe (CP violation), the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter. Most explanations require the presence of new particles, symmetries or forces, which we call Beyond the Standard Model Physics (BSM). This project is designed to pursue searches for BSM physics. \r\n\r\nThe LHC is the premier High Energy Physics particle accelerator in the world and is currently operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland, one of the foremost facilities for answering these BSM questions. The Maryland group is a collaboration member of LHCb, an experiment designed specifically to study the decays of hadrons containing b or c quarks at the LHC.  The goal of LHCb is to identify new physics in nature by examining the properties of hadrons containing these quarks. New physics, or new forces, can be manifest by particles, as yet to be discovered, whose presence would modify decay rates and CP violating asymmetries of hadrons containing the b and c quarks, and thus allow new phenomena to be observed indirectly. \r\n\r\nAnalytically, the Maryland program is focused on measurements related to two of the current anomalies in the decays of B mesons: hints of departure from Lepton Flavor Universality in semi-leptonic B decays and the long-standing so-called K-pi puzzle where the measured CP asymmetries in the family of B decays into the K-pi final state deviate from the expected simple predictions. These anomalies, if confirmed, could be due to the imprints of BSM physics. \r\n\r\nTechnically, the Maryland group leads the development and construction of the off-detector electronics for the new upstream tracker (UT) in the LHCb upgrade and participation in the installation and commissioning of the tracker.  The UT represents a major US contribution to the upgrade of the experiment to improve event reconstruction overall and particularly for rare events of the type under study by the Maryland team.\r\n\r\nThe group works closely with an outreach program run by the physics and astronomy departments at the University of Maryland, called GRAD-MAP, which is aimed at providing research and training opportunities for undergraduates from underrepresented groups in the Maryland and Washington area community colleges.   The LHCb experiment, with its technical challenges and exciting physics program, serves as a major attractor for student participation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nExperimental Study of Heavy Flavor and CP Violation with the LHCb Experiment at the CERN LHC Collider\n\n Understanding the fundamental structure of matter and the origin of the universe is at the core of research in physics, astronomy and cosmology. Our current knowledge of the fundamental constituents of matter and the laws that govern their interactions, obtained from decades of experimental observations and theoretical ideas and efforts, is encapsulated in the so-called Standard Model.  However, the Standard Model is believed to be incomplete, as it fails to account for some important findings and questions, such as the apparent imbalance of matter with respect to antimatter in the universe and the strong evidence for dark matter inferred from astronomical observations. A major goal of this research program has been to search for and examine possible evidence for new particles and new laws of nature beyond those described in the Standard Model. The program involves the study of proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland. These collisions are recorded by a particle spectrometer called the LHCb detector. While the results of these studies overwhelmingly conform to the predictions of the Standard Model, evidence for potential deviations has emerged in a few areas.  Another key objective of this research program has been to make major contributions to the upgrade of the LHCb detector with the aim of significantly enhancing its sensitivity as well as enabling the operation of the detector at higher intensities of the LHC collider.  With the anticipated completion of the installation and commissioning of the upgraded LHCb detector in 2023, extremely precise measurements of properties  heavy quarks and leptons will be made possible allowing for studies of possible footprints of new physics in these interactions.\n\nStudy of Universality of Lepton Interactions\n\nA key feature of the Standard Model is the equality of the strengths of interactions between charged leptons- the three electron-like particles amongst the building blocks of matter- and the gauge bosons that mediate the electroweak forces.  A major goal of our research program has been a comprehensive study of interactions involving the heaviest charged lepton, the tau lepton, relative to those of light leptons, electron and muon.  The results of these studies, which show hints of deviation from the Standard Model predictions, are of great interest to the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. \n\n Study of differences in Matter and Antimatter Interactions\n\nAnother key objective of this program is to perform precise measurements of differences in the behavior of matter particles compared with their antimatter counterparts, the results of which may reveal information on the origin of the observed matter-antimatter imbalance in nature, which is crucial to understanding how the universe evolved to its current state.  Studies carried out in this research program led to new measurements of matter-antimatter asymmetries and the development of new algorithms and techniques that improved the capabilities of the LHCb detector in performing such measurements. \n\n Upgrade of the LHCb Detector\n\n The LHCb collaboration, the international consortium of institutions that built and now operates the LHCb experiment at CERN, is engaged in a major program to upgrade the detector.  The detector upgrade enables the experiment to operate at much higher collision intensities.  On this front, our research program has been focused on the design of sophisticated electronics instrumentation for extracting and recording electrical signals from a silicon strip detector system located just upstream of the LHC magnet.  This device plays a key role in detecting and recording the trajectories of charged particles produced in the collisions.  The new instrument is now being assembled at CERN and will be installed in the LHCb detector during in the 1st quarter of 2023.\n\n Training of young scientists and engineers\n\n In addition to these fundamental research goals, this research program has helped train several young scientists and engineers, including undergraduates, PhD. graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and engineers, in sophisticated detector and electronics design and state-of-the-art data analysis and computing techniques.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Abolhassan Jawahery"
