 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reef-building acroporid corals form the foundation of shallow tropical coral communities throughout the Caribbean. Yet, the once dominant staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) and the elkhorn coral (A. palmata) have decreased by more than 90% since the 1980s, primarily from disease. Their continuing decline jeopardizes the ability of coral reefs to provide numerous societal and ecological benefits, including economic revenue from seafood harvesting and tourism and shoreline protection from extreme wave events caused by storms and hurricanes. Despite their protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act since 2006, threats to the survival of reef-building acroporid corals remain pervasive and include disease and warming ocean temperatures that may lead to further large-scale mortality. However, hybridization among these closely related species is increasing and may provide an avenue for adaptation to a changing environment. While hybrids were rare in the past, they are now thriving in shallow habitats with extreme temperatures and irradiance and are expanding into the parental species habitats. Additional evidence suggests that the hybrid is more disease resistant than at least one of the parental species. Hybridization may therefore have the potential to rescue the threatened parental species from extinction through the transfer of adapted genes via hybrids mating with both parental species, but extensive gene flow may alter the evolutionary trajectory of the parental species and drive one or both to extinction. This collaborative project is to collect genetic and ecological data in order to understand the mechanisms underlying increasing hybrid abundance. The knowledge gained from this research will help facilitate more strategic management of coral populations under current and emerging threats to their survival. This project includes integrated research and educational opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher. Students in the United States Virgin Islands will take part in coral spawning research and resource managers will receive training on acroporid reproduction to apply to coral restoration techniques. \r\n\r\nCurrent models predict the demise of reefs in the next 200 years due to increasing sea surface temperatures and ocean acidification. It is thus essential to identify habitats, taxa and evolutionary mechanisms that will allow some coral species to maintain their role as foundation fauna. Hybridization can provide an avenue for adaptation to changing conditions. Corals hybridize with some frequency and results may range from the introduction of a few alleles into existing parent species via introgression, to the birth of a new, perhaps better adapted genetic lineage. The only widely accepted coral hybrid system consists of the once dominant but now threatened Caribbean species, Acropora cervicornis and A. palmata. In the past, hybrid colonies originating from natural crosses between elkhorn and staghorn corals were rare, and evidence of hybrid reproduction was limited to infrequent matings with the staghorn coral. Recent field observations suggest that the hybrid is increasing and its ecological role is changing throughout the Caribbean. These hybrids appear to be less affected by the disease that led to the mass mortality of their parental species in recent decades. Hybrids are also found thriving in shallow habitats with high temperatures and irradiance suggesting they may be less susceptible to future warming scenarios. At the same time, they are expanding into the deeper parental species habitats. Preliminary genetic data indicate that hybrids are now mating with each other, demonstrating the potential for the formation of a new species. Further, hybrids appear to be capable of mating with both staghorn and elkhorn coral, perhaps leading to gene flow between the parent species via the hybrid. Research is proposed to address how the increase in hybridization and perhaps subsequent introgression will affect the current ecological role and the future evolutionary trajectory of Caribbean acroporids. Specifically, this collaborative project aims to answer the following questions: 1) What is the historic rate, direction, and degree of introgression across species ranges and genomes? Linkage block analysis based on genome-wide SNP genotyping across three replicate hybrid zones will answer this question. 2) What is the current extent and future potential of later generation hybrid formation? Morphometric and genetic analyses combined with in vitro fertilization assays will be used. 3) What mechanisms allow hybrids to thrive in hot, shallow waters? A series of manipulative in situ and ex situ experiments will determine whether biotic or abiotic factors favor hybrid survival in shallow waters. 4) Are hybrids more disease resistant than the parentals species? Disease transmission assays in reciprocal transplant experiments and histological analysis to determine the extent of disease will be conducted. A multidisciplinary approach will be taken that combines traditional and cutting edge technology to provide a detailed analysis of the evolutionary ecology of Caribbean corals.",

Projected future oceanic conditions include increased oceanic temperatures and decreased pH. &nbsp;Exposing acroporid eggs and sperm to future oceanic conditions greatly decreased fertilization across all taxa. Yet across all treatments, hybrids had higher larval survivorship and settlement than at least one of the parental species.&nbsp; Acroporid hybrid adults exposed to increased temperatures showed little response in gene expression unlike the parental species. The microalgal symbionts in hybrids also showed no difference in abundance or chlorophyl concentration after heat exposure, suggesting hybrids may have enhanced survival to future temperature increases. This was confirmed in field surveys, where bleaching occurred less frequently in hybrids than the parental species. In disease transmission studies at three time points across the summer, hybrids demonstrated stronger disease resistance compared to the parental species, but disease resistance waned in hybrids during the warmest months.&nbsp; Resistance to thermal stress and disease is likely why some hybrid populations in the shallows have remained stable while adjacent parental species have declined. Additionally, hybrids, found to have higher growth rates than the parental species, can quickly attach and grow after a disturbance. &nbsp;The ability of hybrids to persist in shallow environments may also be contributed to its tightly clumped morphology, which is more like <em>A. cervicornis</em> at the colony scale but shows intermediate characteristics to the parental species at a microscopic scale. Taken together Caribbean acroporid hybrids are resistant to the primary stressors that have led to the threatened status of the parental species. &nbsp;Yet many attempts to collect spawn to create a second generation in the laboratory or confirm the existence of a second generation in the wild using genetics have failed. However, recruitment of the parental species is also rare. The use of a robust, persistent coral hybrid to replace shallow habitat left void by the loss of the parental species may offer an important alternative for shallow reef restoration, even if sexual reproduction among hybrids is unattainable.</p>\n<p>This NSF grant supported, trained, or provided research experience for 15 master?s and 17 undergraduate students, mostly women and several students from underrepresented groups.
