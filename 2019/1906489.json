 "awd_abstract_narration": "Motivated by recent observational findings, this research project will investigate computationally the formation of interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs).  Results from the study will allow astronomers to understand how COMs are formed in interstellar clouds and the level of molecular complexity that builds under the extreme conditions of interstellar space.  The project will train graduate and undergraduate students in advanced techniques of computational astrochemical research, and it will include outreach activities to enhance the visibility of astrochemistry in the broader scientific community and the public.\r\n\r\nThe research team will investigate a range of new gas-phase and solid-phase chemical processes and generate rates and theoretical formulations for incorporation into large-scale astrochemical networks. The formation mechanisms investigated will enable quantitative interpretation of high angular resolution studies of molecules in interstellar clouds and star-forming regions, allowing competing ideas on the formation of COMs to be tested by means of unified, comprehensive models.  Results from the project would also enable effective exploitation of astronomical facilities built with significant public investment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Project Outcomes Report for the General Public (POR)\n \nOur project, led by two professors funded by the National Science Foundation, is involved in an interdisciplinary subject  known as astrochemistry, in which the tools of astronomy and of chemistry are used jointly to understand important and exciting topics that require a knowledge  of both disciplines.  Our research group is well-known in this area, with heavy use of computers.  Among such topics we have studied are the formation of stars and planets from precursors known as interstellar clouds of gas and dust.  The gas in the clouds consists mainly of molecules, some of which are the same as on earth and some of which are exotic.   Radio waves emitted by these molecules tell us about the molecules that are formed and the star-formation process. Our theoretical results then tell us about the abundances of the molecules and their temperature.  Once stars are formed, planets can form from warm dust particles as these particles combine to form larger solid objects, eventually leading to planets or comets, depending upon conditions.  This NSF grant has allowed us to fund the graduate students who will form the next generation of astrochemists and molecular astronomers.\nThe chemistry that occurs along the path of star formation is complex and consists of many different types of chemical reactions under conditions quite different from the earth.  Gas-phase molecules and dust particles are involved in the chemistry contained in our simulations, which are among the most advanced in astrochemistry. Molecules can be produced in the gas-phase by collisions involving smaller species.  They can also be produced  by first landing on the rough surfaces of dust particles and colliding in a random process known as diffusion.  Both processes are included in our simulations.  We are also interested in the study of the formation of larger gas-phase molecules known as \"complex organic molecules.\"  These species are thought to lead to prebiotic processes in both hot and cold regions.   \nAstrochemistry is a growing topic for the public in the United States and many other countries, especially in Europe and Asia.  To bolster public interest in the US, we have helped to organize a conference involving the National Academy of Sciences, and a week-long series of events on interstellar chemistry by the American Chemical Society designed for the public of all ages.  The principal and co-principal investigators frequently give talks on astrochemistry, both at national and international venues.  The PI gave a talk on the history of astrochemistry to a public audience directed at many countries.  The  principal investigator is also an associate editor of a relatively  new journal known as ACS Earth and Space Sciences.  The PI was recently f&ecirc;ted at a recent International Astronomical Union meeting in July and will be f&ecirc;ted in a few years at a national meeting of the American Chemical Society.  A large percentage of our Ph. D. earners, including a relatively high number of women, have continued their research in astrochemical venues.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/12/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric Herbst"
