 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project, entailing a technology based on chaotic system variability, is its ability to alter and enhance how people interact with music on and off line. By acting as a musical change agent, the proposed technology takes \"personalized music\" beyond playlists and song suggestions. For the first time, music listeners can bring their own creativity to the songs they care about. This project introduces a new paradigm for music where songs evolve and undergo transformation alone or with other songs, at the click of a button. The choice of music as an application for the technology is deliberate. Music is a highly context-dependent application where each note or musical event is determined by the preceding notes and events, and each note or event foreshadows those yet to come. That this advanced technique produces musical variations that can be analyzed as well as used for musical means suggest that the methodology could be applied to other sequences of context-dependent symbols, such as those that define image, text, film, and video. Furthermore, it can serve as an idea generator for media practitioners in general, as well as stimulate interest in engineering for students K-12 and beyond by linking science with the musical arts. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project harnesses chaotic system variability to generate variations of a sequence of context-dependent symbols, such those that constitute a musical work. Most engineers seek ways to eliminate chaotic behavior. Yet in its \"chaotic regime\", a dissipative chaotic system possesses a natural mechanism for variability due to the sensitivity of its solutions to initial conditions. This built-in variability can be exploited by a chaotic mapping technique that transforms an ordered input into a variant ordered output. The variant output can be close to the original work, it can mutate beyond recognition, as well as achieve degrees of variability in between these two extremes. The method includes parsing the input into an ordered sequence of original elements {Ni}, the original elements sequentially indexed by successive integer values i=1,....,imax. For each \"i\", a selection algorithm determines whether Ni is a candidate for modification or replacement, thus becoming a \"receptor element\". A substitution or modifying algorithm then operates on at least one of the receptor elements by varying or replacing it with a substitution element. The resulting ordered set of original and substituted or modified elements comprises the variant output. A virtually infinite set of variations is possible, each unique.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis I-Corps project explores the commercialization potential of an emerging technology at the intersection of chaos science, signal processing, and music.  The intellectual merit of the project involves exploiting nonlinear chaotic system variability to generate variations of context-dependent symbol sequences, such as those comprising musical works, as well as the discovery and development of commercial opportunities for musical variation engines applicable to both audio and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) production platforms.  Though most engineers seek ways to eliminate chaotic behavior, a dissipative chaotic system possesses a natural mechanism for variability due to the sensitivity of its solutions to initial conditions.  This built-in variability can be exploited by a chaotic mapping technique that transforms an ordered input into a variant ordered output.  The variant output can be close to the original work; it can mutate beyond recognition, as well as achieve degrees of variability between these two extremes.  Participation in the I-Corps seven-week intensive program, followed by continued customer discovery, prototyping, and customer validation catalyzed a deep body of knowledge focused on customer needs across target markets of interest.\n\nSignificant results include identifying viable customer segments, value propositions, channels for reaching customers, and customer validation, as evidenced by 232 interviews, of which 78% were in person and the remainder video (due to covid).  The value proposition for the primary customer segment (musician-producers) addresses pain points of stress, anxiety, and self-doubt by 1) reducing the barrier to enter an artistic state, 2) jumpstarting musical ideas, and 3) accelerating the time from initial draft to final result.  Customer discovery continued after the training period to identify other markets in addition to the one that was intensely investigated during the 7-week program. \n\nFor customer validation, a minimum viable product demo was created and tested with our primary customer segment, musician-producers.  Based on their feedback, new variation methods were developed that speak to pitch, rhythmic, and pitch-rhythmic variations.  In addition to two patents awarded during the grant period, recent customer discovery motivated research underpinning a new patent application, as well as a secondary, related market that would benefit from this technology.\n\nThe project provided numerous opportunities for training and professional development, starting with the seven-week I-Corps training program, one-on-one weekly office hours with the instructors, feedback from other teams, in-person attendance at music software and hardware trade shows, virtual attendance at conferences and conventions during covid, as well as MIT Venture Mentoring Service entrepreneurship meetings, workshops, and forums.  Individual meetings were held with stakeholders in the music industry, particularly with music producers.  Participation in the I-Corps program led to a successful NSF Partnerships for Innovation-Technology Transfer grant proposal.\n\nThe broader impacts of this project include:  1) a potentially disruptive technology that can alter how people experience music on and offline; 2) direct interaction with music for musicians and non-musicians alike; and 3) new avenues for music-making (musicians comprise 26% of the US population) based on the time-honored practice of variation as idea generation and development.  Music is composed of a highly context-dependent sequence of symbols where each note or event foreshadows those yet to come.  That this technology produces musical variations capable of being analyzed and used for musical means suggests application to non-musical symbolic sequences, such as DNA sequencing, synthetic biology, and combinatorial chemistry. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Diana Dabby"
