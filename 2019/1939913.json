 "awd_abstract_narration": "The risk of coastal flooding has been growing due to the combined effects of sea level rise, changing storm patterns, increased development, erosion, and in some places, subsidence. Since many of these risks are uninsured, they could have significant financial consequences for the nation and jeopardize the resilience of coastal communities. This project examines whether innovations to insurance marketplaces can produce better outcomes. Work on this project will include synthesis reviews; exploratory and testing workshops; semi-structured interviews; and deep case analysis of analog programs. This effort will draw on best practices for qualitative research to solve \"grand challenges\" and \"wicked problems\" and engage multiple sectors in co-creation of research and outcomes. This work will contribute to our broad understanding of risk transfer instruments and their role in community resilience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
