Potential short term societal and commercial impact includes improved quality of life for physicians, increased capacity for physicians to see more patients, and greater ability for physician to focus on the patient thereby enhancing the quality of healthcare service delivery.  Physicians spend over half their day working with electronic health record systems and typically spend an additional 1.5 hours on clinical documentation at the end of their day.  In the long term, the potential societal and commercial impact is improved quality of care as this work develops a learning health system where the technology can learn from the care of each patient to inform the care of future patients.  \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps process will reveal the value that the intended product can deliver in making physicians more efficient and improving the quality of patient care across market segments (i.e., clinical specialty, care delivery method) as well as better understand the key opportunities, challenges, and stakeholders across segments.  The proposed technology captures clinical documentation in a structured format ready to be utilized by machine learning algorithms in order to enhance physician efficiency by reducing the documentation burden.  Additionally, the datasets can be used to support various needs of health systems including quality improvement, clinical research, operational efficiency, and billing support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The curriculum is based on Steve Blank's lean launchpad course.\n\nThrough this process we developed a business model for taking our technology to market and began the process of building a sales funnel.  Model development was based on 124 customer and stakeholder discovery interviews including 102 in-person interviews.  We have continued to iterate on our business model after the completion of the NSF I-Corps program using the principles we learned.  Our sales funnel efforts helped us identify initial customers for our technology.  These efforts helped support the formation and growth of our startup company, PredictionHealth.\n\nWe have shared our experiences to encourage students and faculty at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine that are interested in entrepreneurship to apply for the NSF I-Corps program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Samuel T Rosenbloom"
