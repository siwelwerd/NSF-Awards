 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engaging early grades students with STEM content in an inquiry-oriented manner is challenging. One way in which this can be done is by having students participate with robots in dramatic play and other student-centered approaches to early childhood education. Programming, and, by consequence, debugging, is critical to the ability to control robot movements. It also contributes to the development of problem-solving skills. It is unreasonable to expect early grades students to gain these skills without being helped by a teacher who has the ability and self-efficacy to engage in debugging. In this three year, collaborative research project, this Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) Exploration and Design project will prototype and research the effectiveness of strategies to help pre-service, early childhood education teachers learn to debug block-based programming. In so doing, the project has the potential to invite members of a population that is overwhelmingly female (early childhood education pre-service teachers) to participate in computer science, a field in which women are drastically under-represented. It also has the potential to positively influence the teaching of computer science in the early grades among students who are from low-resourced settings or from ethnic minority backgrounds - a very important goal for both social justice and ensuring the widest possible talent pool for the computer science workforce of the future. This aligns with the goals of NSF's IUSE program in that it seeks to enhance STEM education processes and outcomes among pre-service, early childhood teachers, who often suffer from weak STEM education preparation.\r\n\r\nThe specific project aims are (a) to determine the nature of the motivational and cognitive challenges that impede successful and efficient debugging among pre-service early childhood teachers, and (b) match scaffolding techniques with specific learner characteristics to promote successful and efficient debugging among pre-service early childhood teachers. To address these aims, the project team will engage in 5 studies - (1) an exploratory study of cognitive and motivational challenges that impede successful and efficient debugging among pre-service early childhood teachers, (2) meta-synthesis of exploratory studies (including pilot studies prior to this project) and clusters of participants according to challenges, (3) data mining of a scaffolding meta-analysis dataset and prototyping scaffolding strategies, and (4-5) implementation studies of scaffolding prototypes. Furthermore, the project team will disseminate results to (a) university educators through workshops and webinars, and (b) STEM education researchers through publication of peer-reviewed journal articles.  This important work is supported with funding from the IUSE program and the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program.",

Much of the extant literature on debugging examined how people debug text-based languages and held that using a structured programming approach was the most effective. Using an asset-based approach, we examined how and why it made sense that our participants used a tinkering approach to debugging, determining that tinkering was performed as part of the process of abductive reasoning (C. Kim et al., 2021). We subsequently redesigned our scaffolding to support the learning of debugging through a tinkering approach. Debugging process quality was a positive predictor of quality with which participants debugged lower-complexity and a higher-complexity problem; performance-avoid goal orientation was a negative predictor and performance-approach goal orientation was a positive predictor of the quality with which participants debugged a lower-complexity and a higher-complexity problem, respectively (Belland et al., 2021). We used a discriminant analysis approach to classify the quality of robotics-enhanced lesson plans, finding that the strongest classifiers were sentiment analysis scores and word counts, with a 12.82%, a 7.69%, and a 23.08% misclassification rate (Belland, Kim, et al., 2022). By clustering an expanded meta-analysis dataset, we found that within college- and graduate-level technology and engineering education, scaffolding is most effective when it is (a) designed to enhance higher order thinking skills, and (b) is either not customized or is customized on the basis of performance (Belland, Lee, et al., 2022). In another study, we found that when using scaffolding, participants engaged in collaborative debugging, whereas participants who did not use scaffolding engage in debugging alone (Kim et al., 2022). In yet another study, we found that preservice teachers who engaged in debugging of block-based coding were able to use analogical reasoning by leveraging multimodal objects (Kim et al., 2023).
