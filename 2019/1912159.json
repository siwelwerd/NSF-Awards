 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources (IUSE: EHR), this project will develop and hold a national workshop entitled \"Data Science Across the Undergraduate Curriculum: University-Industry Online Case Studies on Applications of Data Science.\" The workshop has two major aims: 1) review the national landscape of major online resources for learning and teaching data science across the undergraduate curriculum; and 2) make initial plans for developing frameworks that will guide curricular design, facilitating learning environments, and doing assessments in the context of online case studies on applications of data science.  \r\n\r\nThe growing abundance of data from heterogeneous sources is impacting research, design, manufacturing, marketing, and many workplace practices.  Workshop participants will explore how colleges and universities, in partnership with industry, can better prepare undergraduate students from any major to gather, analyze and use data effectively to improve processes. The workshop will engage participants in online resources and learning environments to develop case studies based on examples of data science applications across a wide range of STEM areas. Each case study will address technical and technology dimensions, applications, and societal implications. Participants will also consider ways to help students understand societal impacts of data science. The workshop will generate a report of its findings that will be available online and on relevant STEM education networks.  The NSF IUSE:EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
