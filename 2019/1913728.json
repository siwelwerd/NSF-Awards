 "awd_abstract_narration": "Following the history-making discovery of nuclear fission, which manifested the huge amount of energy that is released by breaking the strong bonds between neutrons and protons, nuclear physicists have searched for ever more comprehensive explanations of the properties of the atomic nucleus. Such advances are critical to predict exotic nuclei in processes under extreme conditions as stellar mergers and explosions, and to probe neutrino-related processes. The recent advent of radioactive beam facilities has enabled exotic-nuclei measurements, based on collisions of nuclei and their reactions. To predict inaccessible nuclei, these reactions must be well understood and modeled. However, exact solutions exist up to about five particles. The goal of this project is to expand dramatically the capabilities of nuclear reaction theory, by providing input to reaction simulations that are grounded in first principles, but can also accommodate heavier nuclei and enhanced deformation. The latter can help study the origin of elements and neutrino properties, two of the biggest challenges in nuclear physics today. The project will have a wider impact because nuclear energy and national security research has similar needs. Future leaders (postdocs and students) will be trained in low-energy nuclear science and petascale computing, while preparing a web-database for research and educational purposes.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal is to learn from and inform experiments at radioactive beam facilities, and to predict properties of experimentally inaccessible nuclei that are key to advancing our knowledge about astrophysical processes and neutrino physics. The program targets to improve reaction modeling, by constructing the effective interaction between a target and a projectile from first principles (historically, referred to as an optical potential and fitted to experimental data), and thus to account for the challenging microscopic structure of the participating nuclei. As these interactions are an essential input to numerous reaction models that are currently in use, the new developments will serve as an important tool in a broad spectrum of studies. The project will capitalize on a symmetry-guided approach that, by exploiting symmetries known to dominate the dynamics, has enabled ab initio investigations of heavier nuclear species, deformed or not. In this approach, all participating particles are treated on the same footing within a \"shell model\" picture, while employing chiral effective field theory interactions between protons and neutrons. The end products will include calculations of beta decays in nuclei of enhanced deformation, and of reaction observables, e.g., cross sections for scattering, charge-exchange, and (d,p) reactions, of importance to astrophysics.\r\n\r\nThis project advances the objectives of \"Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics\", one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The applications have been done first for light nuclei, but the ultimate goal will be to reach the calcium region. New predictions are now feasible for properties of nuclei and reactions by studying diverse nuclear systems, from well-known stable to rare isotopes. The critical need for this has been recently recognized, as reaction theory that utilizes parameter-free potentials is important to support and inform current and upcoming experiments at rare isotope beam facilities, and is key to advancing our knowledge about astrophysical processes, neutrino physics, and fundamental symmetries in nature. While current applications focus on specific important questions, these new developments have wider impact, as multi-physics simulations in the areas of nuclear energy and national security have similar needs. This research involved high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as a postdoc. They have acquired and furthered their skills in reaction theory and the development of high performance computational physics software, laying the foundations for their careers in science and technology. <br /><br />The project has achieved its overarching goals: To develop an extensible ab initio framework for constructing optical potentials widely used to model nuclear reaction processes and to offer unprecedented quality for systems beyond just the lightest nuclei.&nbsp; To construct such potentials by utilizing the large-scale nuclear structure method recently developed at LSU that can reach medium-mass nuclear species by capitalizing on a symmetry-adapted (SA) concept that exploits symmetries known to dominate in nuclei. To provide the nuclear physics community with reliable potentials rooted in first principles, for reaction codes for calculations of phase shifts, reaction cross sections, and reaction rates, by accounting for the microscopic structure of the participating nuclei. To calculate electroweak transitions from first principles for beta decays and neutrinoless double beta decay. To reach unprecedented accuracy for transition matrix elements in LSU's symmetry-adapted nuclear structure framework and to describe the challenging cluster structure of 8Be, for input to high-precision beta decay experiments and probing physics beyond the standard model with the aim to provide a stringent limit on the tensor component of the electroweak interaction.</p>\n<p><br />In particular, under this award, a novel ab initio framework has been developed that combined the large-scale symmetry-adapted no-core shell-model theory with the Green's function technique to construct parameter-free potentials for a single-nucleon projectile in the presence of a target nucleus. This has been applied to light targets such as 4He, 6He (halo) and 12C (deformed). A natural extension of this development is to construct such potentials for deuteron projectiles, critical for deuteron break-up reactions of significance to studies of nucleosynthesis. In addition, applications up through the Calcium region are now feasible. We note that these solutions are only possible due to the ability of the SA framework to trim the size of the model space to only the physically relevant basis states, e.g., down to 112 millions of basis states for the lowest 3 states in 20Ne, as compared to the inaccessible full size of 40 trillion basis states.
