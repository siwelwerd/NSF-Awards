 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to reduce the annual water quality monitoring operating cost of $213MM by an estimated $50MM per year. Water quality monitoring systems (WQMS) are crucial equipment to collect the water resource data and to protect the water environment which is essential to sustain human life. Currently, over 6,000 WQMS are deployed all over the country.  These systems require frequent maintenance with service intervals of about three weeks on average. This adds significant expenses to the overall operating budget of the water management districts.  Our controlled cavitation technology (CCT) system would be able to integrate with the current WQMS to solve the biofouling problems by expanding the maintenance period to three months. Through the successful customer discovery of this I-Corps project a new annual $18MM market will be opened in the US for the CCT biofouling removal product for WQMS. The CCT device can reduce maintenance costs of WQMS and thereby reduce the overall operating budget. Furthermore, it will support and increase effectiveness of water resource environment management by presenting an opportunity to deploy about 20% more WQMS with the saved budget and reducing the corrupted data due to the biofouling growth.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project will focus on a CCT biofouling removal device for our first target customers narrowly defined as WQMS operators. CCT is an innovative solution for removal of biofouling growth on underwater surfaces. It can remove biofouling effectively without damaging the affected surfaces. Also, the removal of biofouling can be done effectively without contacting the target surface. This technology is applicable for removal of biofilm on underwater optic sensor surfaces. Furthermore, CCT is an environmentally friendly technology because it does not use chemicals for biofouling removal. CCT will prevent the growth of biofouling before it starts to affect the sensor. This technology lends itself into a technically and a commercially feasible state-of-the-art solution compared to the existing \"brush type\" cleaning devices. Furthermore, other commercial opportunities for this technology include the removal of biofouling in marine (hull cleaning) and medical (surgical tools) applications. Intellectual property (IP) is being addressed through a patent application.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A total of 115 interviews were conducted from six different states to establish the elements of business model canvas for the product. The key major fact what we have learned from this research are: 1) Our customers are water quality monitoring professionals who will buy our biofouling removal device in order to reduce maintenance time labor and cost. 2) The decision maker is a project manager. 3) The customer eco-system is a complex system. It has a circulating system that executes of water quality monitoring projects that are run by plan and funding based on the feedback of the data from the previous projects. 4) There are four major distribution channels (direct sales, manufacturer representative, distributor, and renter). 5) The customer acquisition cost is estimated almost 8 times higher than the product price and expected to meet the breakeven points after 800 units are sold considering the diminishing of the customer acquisition cost as the more customers returns. 6) The complexity of channel should be considered to measure the reduction of payment. 7) The value proposition of the product and customer sector should meet the market fit. Through this I-Corps program, our team go out of the building, meet people, and tested hypotheses to verify them in real world through our potential customers. This enabled our team to learn what are the actual needs of customers and how the product should be developed. This research was extremely important not to deviate from customers needs to make a product that actually can be sold by meeting the market fit. Moreover, by collecting all necessary components of the business model canvas, the end to end life chain of a product can be accomplished so that it can be sold in real
