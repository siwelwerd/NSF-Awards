 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Hampton University will enhance undergraduate education in the Computer Science department to prepare students to meet the needs of the workforce related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) or advanced studies in AI. Undergraduate students are involved in the project as researchers and peer tutors. \r\n\r\nThe key goal of this project is to integrate artificial intelligence modules and assignments into core computer science courses to increase students' career preparation, knowledge, and professional skills related to an area of artificial intelligence. The three specific activities will be to: develop artificial intelligence modules and course-relevant assignments; reform the core computer science courses; and enhance the current advanced elective courses, such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science.  The project will disseminate its findings widely and have significant broader impacts on the education of African American computer science majors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
