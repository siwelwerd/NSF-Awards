 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ocean systems are critical to the well-being of the United States, providing goods through shipping and port systems, providing energy through offshore oil, gas, and renewable development, and providing national security through ocean based national defense systems. The integration of autonomy into ocean systems has the potential to significantly impact these fundamental industries by reducing costs and enabling new industry advances through unmanned navigation of transport vessels, development of underwater drones for oceanographic surveying or defense activities, digital twin development for operation and control of vehicles and platforms, and optimization in design for the development of competitive renewable energy technologies. The Center for Ocean System Simulation and Control (COSSC) seeks to integrate multi-fidelity computational modeling techniques with physical sensor systems to advance fundamental research in the controlled operation of smart ocean systems, including the use of advanced materials, the use of distributed sensing, autonomy and innovation of vehicles and platforms, energy savings, and fluid-structure dynamic modeling. Based on the research interests inputs given by the industry, both sites will form diversified research groups including underrepresented students, organize outreach programs for young generations, and design short courses for industry professionals. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this planning phase of the center is to assess the viability of the center, with two sites located at Texas A&M University (TAMU) and the University of Rhode Island (URI). This project will include a planning meeting to meet with prospective industry members of the center to present fundamental research topics and develop a set of initial industry vetted research projects to form the research basis of the center. The TAMU site will focus on industry collaborations in offshore oil and gas and shipbuilding, with example research topics in smart offshore system health monitoring, coupled fluid-structure modeling, CFD of extreme loading events, optimization of floating vessel geometry, and complexity reduction in CFD modeling. The URI site will focus on industry collaborations in defense and ocean renewable energy with example research topics in fast CFD hybrid methods, floating vehicle motion control from reconstructed sea states, hydrodynamic modeling for micro UUVs, moving vehicle digital twins, and interaction of wave energy converters with marine sediments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was a planning grant to assess the establishment of an NSF IUCRC called the Center for Ocean System Simulation and Control.  The IUCRC has two sites, one at the University of Rhode Island and one at Texas A&amp;M University, with this planning grant focused on establishment of the URI site.  The planning activities looked to establish a center focused on developing a fundamental understanding of integrated physical sensing with variable fidelity computational simulation for the control of smart ocean systems, focusing on transferring fundamental knowledge to the defense, renewable energy, and offshore industries.\n\nThe planning process covered in this grant included training at the National Science Foundation in order to develop a center business model, value propositions, and recruitment/retainment strategies for industry members in the center.  As a result, the establishment of the COSSC IUCRC has the potential for ocean industry companies to invest in workforce development and fundamental research that can directly impact advances in ocean systems, including the development of digital twin technology that can incease safety and reduce operational costs, increase the use of autonomy in ocean systems, and introduce cost reductions through the use of modeling and simulation.\n\nThe planning process also included holding a hybrid virtual and in-person planning meeting, held in Houston, Texas on July12-13, 2021.  The planning meeting connected potential industry participants in the center with participating faculty, established the operating membership requirements for the center, and introduced potential research projects for the center, that were ranked by participating industry members in the meeting.  This process established research themes for the center of particular interest to the potential industry members, including digital twins of ocean systems, artifical intelligence applied to ocan systems, ocean renewable energy, and multi-fidelity computational fluid dynamics.  The outcome of this meeting was identification of interested members in the center and the establishment of collaborative research projects between sites focused on these research themes.\n\nThe planning meeting also outlined ways to engage graduate students through the formation of the COSSC center and included strategies for broadening participation and diversity, equity, and inclusion, including leveraging the LSAMP program at both universities for recruitment of participating students, early placement of underrepresented undergraduates in research labs participating in the center, providing funding for summer research opportunities to underrepresented students, and increasing networking opportunities for students with industry participants, with the goal of establishing regular hiring opportunities for graduating students.\n\nThis project established the necessary framework in order to establish a COSSC IUCRC.  It was found that sufficient interest exists from companies in the defense, renewable energy, and offshore energy sector in order to maintain the financial membership requirements for the center to operate.  As a result of this planning process and recruitment activities, TAMU and URI will submit a full proposal to the National Science Foundation to request to establish the COSSC IUCRC.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason Dahl"
