Recent advances in data collection and application provide the promise of more efficient and novel materials discovery to accelerate creation and use of novel materials to serve society.  To realize the opportunities of such data, however, we require more open and integrated ways to understand and share information across the materials domain. \r\n\r\nThis project is a community-based effort that takes a multifaceted approach to strengthening the Materials Data Infrastructure (MDI) core by facilitating direct action across the breadth of materials domain stakeholders. It fits NSF's priority to Harness the Data Revolution (HDR) as one of 10 Big Ideas to drive important aspects of the research agenda. HDR goals dovetail with the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) launched in 2011 to create a framework for government agencies to support research programs that build materials research data infrastructure. Nearly eight years into the MGI and as the community reaches to Harness the Data Revolution, we have an acute need to evaluate progress and develop specific guidance to help move the materials domain toward realization of its data-centric vision. Our effort is focused on how to bring centers of data creation into a unified vision to truly share data in FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable), functional ways to advance materials research. The project includes five, coordinated activities:\r\n1.\tSurvey of current U.S. academic materials research data infrastructure and management practices.\r\n2.\tEducation and promotion of FAIR data principles.\r\n3.\tConvening a summit on Big Data and cyberinfrastructure in materials research.\r\n4.\tPublication of a report of summit findings and outcomes.\r\n5.\tCreation of a Materials Research Data Coordinating Council.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
