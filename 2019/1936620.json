 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Program on Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) has been enhancing the knowledge base for U.S. research policy since 2007 by supporting research projects in many disciplines. The 2019 SciSIP Grantee Conference will help to build this research area by featuring the work of early career scholars and showing the range of research topics and useful results the field has produced. New thinking often comes when researchers approach a problem from different angles and put their insights together. The conference will highlight places where this happens in the science of science and innovation policy and point to the ways research results in this field contribute to effective U.S. policies that encourage new support for the advancement of knowledge, well-trained scientists and engineers, and new products and processes that strengthen business and employment in the United States. \r\n\r\nThe Conference includes five sessions that are part of the broader Atlanta Conference on Science and Innovation Policy, which provides an international audience for SciSIP results. One plenary session will focus specifically on the uses of results in this field for policy, in international comparative perspective. Another plenary, featuring two SciSIP grantees, explores new manufacturing approaches, both within the United States and globally. Rapporteurs will summarize SciSIP research related to the Atlanta Conference presentations. A special half-day workshop only for SciSIP grantees held immediately following the Atlanta Conference, including summaries from the discussant/rapporteurs. The focus of this workshop will be on exchanging methodological perspectives and research results, in order to create bridges among the highly interdisciplinary SciSIP portfolio.  The workshop will close with a session featuring early career researchers, in which they will present fruitful future directions for the field. A written summary, including the reports from the rapporteurs, will follow.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
