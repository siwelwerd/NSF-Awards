 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides participant support to Conference on Computational Mathematics and Applications (CCMA), to be held at University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV), October 25-27, 2019. Computational Mathematics is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary field lying at the intersection of mathematics and many disciplines of science and engineering. With the increasing of computational technology in recent years, the pivotal role of Computational Mathematics continues to expand to broader areas that include not only the traditional science and engineering, but also social sciences, finance, medical science and data science. In order to disseminate the state-of-the-art computational techniques and put them into broad applications, the organizers propose to host \"Conference on Computational Mathematics and Applications (CCMA) at the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) during October 25-27, 2019. Holding the proposed conference at UNLV will not only provide a strong stimulus for our graduate students and increase the local research activity for mathematicians and people from other related disciplines, it will also serve as a new catalysis for proposing new computational methodology and pointing some new research directions in scientific computing.\r\n\r\nThis conference will bring many prominent scholars in Computational and Applied Mathematics to address important topics that have fundamental scientific merits and significant application values.  Topics to be focused are: \"Recent advances in wave propagation and applications\", \"Numerical methods for stochastic PDEs and applications\", \"Numerical analysis and modeling of complex fluids\", and \"Machine Learning for Scientific Computing\". The organizers plan to host around 60 participants with 6 invited plenary 50-minute talks, and several parallel sessions of 30-minute talks. The organizers will strive to support about 10 postdocs and junior faculty, especially women and under-represented minorities. The subjects covered in this conference will benefit not only mathematics, but also many other computational related fields such as mechanical engineering, geosciences, physics, and medical sciences. To create a long term impact, a refereed conference proceeding will be published after the conference either as a book in the AMS Contemporary Mathematics series or as a special issue of a computational science journal. More details are available at http://cams.sites.unlv.edu/conferences/ccma2019/ccma2019.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
