 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a coating product with superior durability and antifouling performance in the targeted environmental-friendly marine coating market. This innovative solution requires a less frequent application and reduces the amount of subaquatic growth on the hull of ships and static objects in bodies of water. Potential economic benefits include improving fuel efficiency and saving the maintenance cost of ships and static marine structures. At the same time, this product provides enormous environmental benefits by reducing the greenhouse gas emission from cargo ships and avoiding the potential species invasion caused by current marine coatings. In particular, this product is the first non-biocide environmentally friendly product of its kind. It addresses the current and future needs highlighted by global regulations to replace the existing harmful biocide-leaching coatings with an eco-friendly solution.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop and commercialize a novel marine coating product to deliver a high-performing eco-friendly antifouling solution that is currently lacking in the marketplace. Current self-polishing coating products were subject to increasing regulatory restriction, while alternative environmental-friendly option such as fouling-release coating suffered low antifouling performance. This novel coating technology potentially achieves the durability and high antifouling performance for targeted marine applications, and the eco-friendly feature without leaching biocide into the aqueous environment. The objective of this project is to explore the key fabrication factors in coating formulation and identify their impacts on the coating stability and antifouling performance. Critical knowledge will be obtained enables the development of prototype product showing year-long reliability and top marine antifouling function.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this STTR Phase I project, Repela Tech developed a novel eco-friendly antifouling coating for under-the-waterline marine applications.  Over ninety percent of marine antifoulant products in use today contain toxic ingredients, the most common being copper-based biocides.  These biocides leach into the water, harming marine organisms and polluting waterways.  Because of their toxicity, biocides are under regulatory review in the United States as well as globally.  Repela Tech?s coating contains no biocides; thus, is environmentally friendly and sustainable.\n\nThe eco-friendly antifouling coating is called the Repela System and is comprised of a naturally antifouling hydrophilic polymeric material. Application of the Repela System on a substrate, like the hull of a vessel, can be done by brush or spray. When submerged, the material forms a barrier coat that masks the underlying substrate from biofouling organisms such as algae, slime, and barnacles.  The Repela System is effective in fresh and saltwater, and static and dynamic conditions.\n\nCopper-based self-polishing copolymers (SPC) are currently the most widely used marine antifoulant.  Silicone-based fouling-release coatings (FRC) are an eco-friendly substitute that is less toxic, but in general, inferior in antifouling performance.  Phase I tests comparing the Repela System?s antifouling performance to both SPC and FRC show the Repela System matches the performance of the industry standard SPC and significantly outperforms FRC.\n\nHydrophilic materials are notorious for being unstable in aqueous environments, which presents a technical challenge when trying to create a functional product out of the material.  Nevertheless, this Phase I project overcame this challenge by developing a proprietary application method for securing the Repela System?s hydrophilic coating to a substrate.  Phase I tests of stability in seawater showed the coating remained intact even after being subject to months of constant shear.\nOverall, this STTR Phase I project demonstrated the feasibility of the Repela System coating as an eco-friendly replacement to toxic SPCs. The work of the Phase I project has established a baseline for the composition and production methods of the novel coating.  The next steps will be to fine tune the formulation for performance and ease of application and develop robust processes for small batch production.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sheu-Jane Gallagher"
