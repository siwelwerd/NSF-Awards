 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wearables systems are smart, connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices which integrate digital health and user-friendly wearables. With the exponential increase in the wearable market growth (predicted to be $34 B by 2020), education and training in these areas becomes crucial. The multi and interdisciplinary research in wearables spans the areas of nanotechnology, advanced materials engineering, microelectronics, sensors, interfaces, and communications; and forms the cornerstone to impact many engineering sectors, ranging from defense to healthcare. As an example, wearable sensors powered by advances in nanotechnology and communications are facilitating the tracking of vital parameters in the patients' natural environment. Over the next decade, the correlation of environmental parameters with individual health parameters generated by nano-enabled wearable sensors will lead to a new paradigm in healthcare and will enable patients, doctors, scientists and engineers to predict, manage and treat chronic disease. The REU Site: Wearable and Emerging technologies - Facilitating research Opportunities and Creating pathways for Underrepresented Students (WE-FOCUS) at Florida International University (FIU) aims to provide students an early exposure to the cutting-edge research activities to prepare them to adapt to new technological environments they will live and work in. It will help prepare students to successfully serve in the nation's continuing development through their careers as scientists, engineers, and leaders in these emerging technologies, and advance the cultural diversity in the American STEM workforce. This vision directly supports NSF's 2018-2022 strategic goal of early investment in the development of the next generation of researchers to advance the capability of the Nation to meet current and future challenges. \r\n\r\nFOCUS addresses the growing need for a skilled workforce in the areas of critical technology needs in the coming decades. Through this program, FIU will recruit academically talented students from culturally and racial/ethnically diverse populations along with placing a special emphasis on attracting women participants to the program. Students will be immersed in a research experience in the field of wearable sensors and systems integrated with and facilitated by tiered mentoring offered by faculty, postdocs, and graduate students to ensure their persistence in the program. Additionally, professional development seminars, workshops, and field trips will be organized to enhance scholars' interest in STEM careers. Upon completion of their summer research project, focused advising will be provided throughout the academic year to ensure the success of students in advance level engineering courses. Student feedback and program evaluation results will be used to identify the best practices to improve research experience in engineering disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Moreover, projections suggest a promising future forthe market, with an expected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.6% from 2023 to2030. This exponential growth demands a skilled STEM force that can contribute to nationalresearch, growth, and development needs. Our mission via the NSF-WEFOCUS program was tooffer students early exposure to cutting-edge research, facilitating their adaptation to evolvingtechnological environments and providing hands-on industrial experiences. The WEFOCUSprogram leverages the existing extensive research in wearables, micro nanofabrication,microelectronics, biosensors, signal communication, etc. at FIU, to provide a platform forexciting, retaining, and graduating undergraduate students in engineering disciplines.The 4-year outcome from 2019 to 2023 resulted in training ~35 undergraduate students and 6 K-12 teachers in the area of wearable sensors, electronics, data communication, signal processing,and material science. The WE FOCUS REU program successfully showed improvedparticipation of female and underrepresented minority students in the WEFOCUS program andled to increased awareness and eventual enrollment of undergraduate students into graduateprograms. Based on the 4-year evaluation, the WE FOCUS program successfully recruited adiverse group of students for the summer program. The program was successful in hiring astudent from across the country and helped generate awareness of the research activity carriedout at FIU, especially in the electrical, and mechanical engineering departments. When comparedwith the typical population of students in STEM programs (see National Center for EducationStatistics, 1996, 2001), the WE FOCUS program was able to recruit and retain a much morediverse group of students. The WE FOCUS REU program implemented &ldquo;a three-tier mentoringsystem, consisting of leading faculty research mentors, postdoctoral associates, and graduatestudents&rdquo; to support undergraduate student participants. This approach was highly successful inproviding two-way support to REU students from graduate and post-doctoral students, which ledto a strong team effort and eventually 4 publications in high-ranking science journals. Theoutcome of the research activity led towards building interest and awareness in science careers(STEM), cumulative data showed a 100% interest of REU students in STEM education with62% interest in research and teaching careers and 42.9% interest in industry careers. Theprogram led to the development of cortisol, testosterone, and wound biosensors (all published)which in the future are aimed to provide solutions to hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, and thepharmaceutical industries, thereby providing early and predictive diagnosis to multiple diseases.Based on the 4-year longitudinal study and evaluation data, showed that the program maintaineda high degree of success in terms of student outcomes and an improvement in areas related to theresearch projects given to REU students.Overall, the program successfully recruited a diverse group of participants and provided them anopportunity to become integral members of a research community focused on wearabletechnologies.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Shekhar&nbsp;Bhansali</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852396/1852396_10595528_1706931006119_Image--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852396/1852396_10595528_1706931006119_Image--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Group Photo Summer REU\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1852396/1852396_10595528_1706931006119_Image--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Group Photo Summer REU\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The photoshoot of summer REU</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ana Posadas</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shekhar&nbsp;Bhansali\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Group Photo Summer REU</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
