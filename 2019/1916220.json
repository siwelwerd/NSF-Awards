 "awd_abstract_narration": "In modern applications, very large and complex data sets are routinely collected without a specific research question in mind. Rather, the express goal is to explore the data in search of novel insights, discovering relationships and structure they may not expected to be found, then report inferences for those findings. This project provides a series of iterative algorithmic frameworks for interactive multiple testing, which blend exploratory and confirmatory analyses. The frameworks are adaptive in an unusually strong sense: at each step of the procedure, the algorithm reveals more data to the analyst who makes data-driven decisions that guide the procedure.\r\n\r\nThe starting point of this project is the PI's recent work on the AdaPT and STAR algorithms, which give flexible and powerful frameworks for controlling the FDR while exploiting side information (AdaPT) or enforcing constraints on the rejection set (STAR). Given predictor for each p-value, AdaPT lets analysts interactively estimate Bayes-optimal p-value weights from the data using any machine learning method, while provably controlling finite-sample FDR. The STAR likewise allows for generic interactive modeling while also guaranteeing that the rejection set satisfies natural structural constraints such as hierarchy principles in regression. Both methods guarantee FDR control by means of optional stopping arguments, giving near-total flexibility to the analyst to adaptively model the data. The PI will work on four projects that continue this research program by developing new interactive methods and applying AdaPT to current scientific problems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
