 "awd_abstract_narration": "The internet-of-things has recently gained popularity in the cost-effective and long-term health monitoring, enabled by collecting and analyzing biological information from wearable micro- and nano-scale sensors. Although battery-free micro-sensors can achieve inexpensive, long-lived and maintenance-free operation, these miniature sensors usually suffer from unwanted electromagnetic interferences, such as clutters, echoes, and multipath fading, which greatly reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and the wireless interrogation range. To surmount these challenges, this research project will investigate a new class of self-powered, chemically-tuned harmonic transponders as wireless biosensors. The harmonic biosensor consists of all-graphene antenna and integrated circuit (graphene is, basically, a single atomic layer of graphite), which can be made transparent, light-weight, flexible, and biocompatible for medical applications, thus making possible a contact lens sensor for low-cost, portable, and continuous diagnosis of pathogen bacteria, proteins, and versatile biomolecular markers. The proposed wireless bio-sensing technology may lead to various applications, such as detection of viral eye infections, ocular surface tumors, and intraocular pressure. In addition, the project will also integrate the research into the new courses and outreach activities in Wayne State University (e.g., ReBUILDetroit Program, Richard Barber Interdisciplinary Research Program, and WSU STEM Days) for recruiting under-represented and K-12 students in the Detroit metropolitan area and promoting their interest in pursuing a career in radio-frequency (RF) engineering and biomedical electronics. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research project is to investigate the low-noise, energy-efficient wireless micro-sensor system based on all-graphene RF- and bio-electronics. The key scientific advance of this research lies in the harmonics-based bio-sensing technique, which uses a fully passive and chemically reconfigurable transponder as a harmonic biosensor to achieve real-time and long-range wireless bio-sensing. Fundamentally different from conventional backscatter sensors, the harmonic biosensor, launching and detecting signals of orthogonal frequencies, can enable longer detection range against electromagnetic interferences and human-body backscatter clutters. The harmonic biosensor can be realized with a simple graphene-based bioelectronic circuit which combines functions of a biosensor and a frequency multiplier into a single module, based on the unique ambipolar and tunable electronic properties of graphene transistors. Moreover, this bio-sensitive RF transponder can be connected to a transparent, dual-band graphene antenna placed onto the flexible biocompatible substrate. The selective binding of biomolecules, such as infectious or bio-threat agents, on the graphene harmonic biosensor can be wirelessly monitored by launching a monotone RF signal and detecting the strength of the backscattered second harmonic, as the frequency conversion efficiency is altered by the biomolecular concentration. If successful, the compact and transparent graphene harmonic biosensor can be integrated on the soft contact lens to sensitively detect targeted pathogen bacteria, infectious agents, diseases, or metabolic changes of interest, and wirelessly transmit data without any power source or sophisticated circuit. With further development, the proposed wireless biosensors can have broad impacts in healthcare monitoring.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Although battery-less RFID-based wireless sensors enable inexpensive, long-lived and maintenance-free operation, they often suffer from unwanted electromagnetic interferences, such as clutters, echoes, self-jamming and Tx/Rx cross-talks, which significantly degrade the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduce the range and reliability of wireless interrogation. In this regard, the main challenge for the practical application and proliferation of unobtrusive wireless sensors lies in how to increase their sensitivity, reliability, and lifetime (toward maintenance/battery-free), while reducing their overall cost and size. As inspired by the clutter-free harmonic radar, in this CAREER project we have developed novel compact, low-profile and fully-passive harmonic-transponder sensors (or harmonic sensors) and systems to significantly suppress the aforementioned interferences in practical wireless sensing scenarios. In particular, we have proposed the compact, transparent, flexible and battery-less harmonic biosensors based on graphene bioelectronics, opening up new possibilities for building the next-generation wireless sensing and diagnosis platforms. We have also integrated the proposed research in the education and outreach projects of RF and microwave engineering and bioelectronics, as well as training the next generation of scientists and engineers.</p>\n<p>Our team have successfully designed and implemented various types of clutter-free, passive harmonic sensors for continuous, real-time remote monitoring of materials, fluidics, chemical reactions, gases, PH, and infrastructure health (IEEE Trans. Microw. Theory Techn. <strong>68</strong>, 4846-4854 (2020); IEEE Sensors J. <strong>20</strong>, 12495-12503 (2020); IEEE J. Radio Freq. Id. <strong>4</strong>, 265-274 (2020); 2023 IEEE Sensors, doi: 10.1109/SENSORS56945.2023.10324978; IEEE Sensors J. <strong>24</strong>, 9998-10005 (2024)). Moreover, we proposed for the first time the utilization of frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) technique to improve the absolute accuracy of harmonic sensors. We have shown that FHSS-aided harmonic sensors can provide greatly improved SNR, clutter-resistivity, decently good fading margins, and increased interrogation distance in noisy and rich-scattering environments. We envision that harmonic tags developed in this project can be integrated with versatile sensors, actuators, and transducers to facilitate the practice of passive wireless sensing in healthcare, industrial, and environmental applications. Furthermore, for the first time, we put forward the ultracompact, lightweight, and zero-power harmonic biosensors based on graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) and integrated circuits. We have come up with a new class of (bio)chemically-reconfigurable harmonic transponders based on novel dual/quad-ring frequency multipliers that are constituted by back-gate or side-gate GFETs (IEEE Sensors J. <strong>21</strong>, 8333-8340 (2021); IEEE Sensors J. <strong>23</strong>, 3243-3250 (2023)). These graphene-based RF circuits can act as a (bio-)chemical sensor and a passive frequency modulator simultaneously (i.e., a chemically-sensitive modulator), thus reducing the size, cost, and power consumption of harmonic biosensors. In addition, graphene-based RF biosensing circuits can be monolithically integrated with transparent and flexible antennas based on graphene or other nanomaterials (IEEE Trans. Antennas Propagat. <strong>71</strong>, 67-77 (2023); Device <strong>2</strong>, 100289 (2024), so as to realize all-graphene harmonic biosensors for practical healthcare and medical applications, such as contact lens sensors, smart glasses, smart bandages, smart microscope slides, and various point-of-care testing devices. We have also developed new nanofabrication and biofunctionalization strategies that allow for the selective binding of targeted bacteria, fungi, pathogens, or molecules on graphene transistors, thereby enabling the label-free detection of biomarkers (IEEE Sensors J. <strong>22</strong>, 5514-5520 (2022)). During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have extended the idea of harmonic sensor to the wireless smart facemask for monitoring the history and pattern of coughs, breath, as well as wearing condition of facemask. Specifically, this lightweight, reusable, and battery-free smart facemask with improved user comfort consists of antenna, circuitry and substrate made from flexible, stretchable, breathable, and biocompatible nanomaterials (ACS Nano <strong>16</strong>, 5874-5884 (2022); IEEE Trans. Biomed. Circ. Syst. <strong>16</strong>, 129-137 (2022)). This technology may be exploited not only to mitigate the spread of infectious respiratory diseases during a pandemic, but also to facilitate health condition monitoring in clinical practice (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases), telemedicine and telehealth. Throughout this project, we have also explored several other topics, such as new hardware security solutions for wireless sensing and communication, of which electromagnetic physically unclonable functions (Nature Communications <strong>14</strong>, 1145 (2023)) used for identification and authentication are generated using graphene circuits.
