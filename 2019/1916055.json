 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will develop new observational capabilities by reactivating two instruments near the magnetic equator, a region which hosts a unique and puzzling set of phenomena in the near-Earth plasma environment. These phenomena range from large-scale plasma fountains that transport plasma away from the equator to small-scale disturbances in the plasma density that adversely affect satellite communication and navigation. The focus of the current investigation is on the equatorial spread F or ESF, a multi-scale plasma structure whose origins are poorly understood. This project will investigate generation of ESF by conducting two-dimensional, multi-instrumented observations of plasma conditions at the magnetic equatorial site of the Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO). This project will develop a better understanding of fundamental plasma processes including plasma instabilities and plasma-neutral coupling at low geomagnetic latitudes which are known to be a significant source of plasma disturbances that can disrupt radio communication channels. Further collaborative linkages between partner institutions in the US and an international partner (JRO) will be developed through this work. It will also promote teaching and stimulate integration of research and education by directly supporting one post-doctoral researcher and one graduate student, and by the Principal Investigator incorporating results from this research into classroom activities. \r\n\r\nThe work will involve (1) a repair of a new radar system and airglow imager at JRO, (2) conducting 2D radio and optical observations of ESF at JRO, (3) ESF propagation analysis to determine whether F-region structures are generated locally or transported from another location, (4) comparing ESF occurrence and strength with plasma drift measurements to evaluate a hypothesis that post-midnight, quiet-time ESF can develop under conditions of weakening downward drifts, and (5) analysis of collocated radio and optical observations to study the causal relationship between large-scale plasma structures and ESF in the late-evening and post-midnight sectors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
