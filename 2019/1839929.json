 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wind flow over changes in the landscape often introduce circulations that can impact temperature and evaporation on small scales.  Most of the prior work on this subject has been for winds that flow from one type of surface to another, such as from a wooded area to an open field.  This study will instead look at the circulations that form when the wind is blowing in the same direction as the boundary between land surface types.  This work has important implications for sustaining agriculture in very dry areas, such as the southwestern United States.  In addition to water resources, understanding these flows may also have impacts on pollen, dust, and pesticide transport and the movement of aphids.  The award also represents an international collaboration with scientists from Israel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award is an international collaboration among researchers funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation. The research team plans to study the role of landscape heterogeneities on small-scale atmospheric flows.  A significant amount of research has taken place on landscape changes that are perpendicular to the flow, but not as much on the circulations that set up when the landscape changes are along the flow vector.  The overall intent of the project is to advance fundamental understanding of atmospheric boundary layer turbulence when responding to the presence of abrupt landscape heterogeneities.  The research team will systematically explore how spanwise heterogeneity of the aerodynamics characteristics of vegetative canopies induces secondary rolls, which have major implications for evapotranspiration and heat fluxes.  The work will make use of large-eddy simulation modeling (US component) and laboratory studies using a 12m environmental wind tunnel with particle image velocimetry and constant temperature anemometry measurements (Israel component).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge-eddy simulation was used to model turbulent atmospheric surface layer (ASL) flow over canopies composed of streamwise-aligned rows of synthetic trees of height, h, and systematically arranged to quantify the response to variable streamwise spacing, delta1, and spanwise spacing, delta2, between adjacent trees. The response to spanwise and streamwise heterogeneity has, indeed, been the topic of a sustained research effort: the former resulting in formation of Reynolds-averaged counter-rotating secondary cells, the latter associated with the k- and d-type response. No study has addressed the confluence of both, and results herein show secondary flow polarity reversal across 'critical' values of delta1and delta2. For delta2/delta 1and 2, where deltais the flow depth, the counter-rotating secondary cells are aligned such that upwelling and downwelling, respectively, occurs above the elements. The streamwise spacing delta1regulates this transition, with secondary cell reversal occurring first for the largest k-type cases, as elevated turbulence production within the canopy necessitates entrainment of fluid from aloft. The results are interpreted through the lens of a benchmark prognostic closure for effective aerodynamic roughness, z0,Eff= alpha sigma_h, where alphais a proportionality constant and sigma_h is height root mean square. We report alphaapprox10^(1), the value reported over many decades for a broad range of rough surfaces, for k-type cases at small delta2, whereas the transition to d-type arrangements necessitates larger delta2. Though preliminary, results highlight the non-trivial response to variation of streamwise and spanwise spacing.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/14/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: WilliamAnderson\n"
