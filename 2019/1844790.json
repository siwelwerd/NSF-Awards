 "awd_abstract_narration": "Comprehending language is an incremental process in which the listener attempts to integrate each incoming word into the structure and meaning of the sentence as it unfolds. Increasingly, this process is also argued to involve the prediction of upcoming parts of the sentence. However, open questions remain regarding what type of linguistic information is used in order to generate predictions, and to what extent individuals differ in their ability to engage in prediction. This dissertation research project uses electroencephalography (EEG), a brain-imaging technique with millisecond-level timing resolution, to examine whether the brain utilizes predictive cues to anticipate a complex syntactic structure in Mandarin. This study also examines to what extent the ability to predict complex structures depends on verbal and non-verbal cognitive abilities, providing new insights regarding the neurological basis of language and the cognitive abilities that modulate success in language comprehension.\r\n\r\nThis project examines what type of linguistic information is used to predict upcoming structure during processing, focusing on the prediction of relative clauses in Mandarin (e.g., the string \"Mary wrote\" in \"the book Mary wrote\"). In Mandarin, it is only at the end of the phrase that there is any marker indicating that the words form a relative clause; therefore, predicting relative clauses in advance may be critical for processing these sentences without disruption. This project examines whether tense expressions that appear early in a sentence may provide a predictive cue indicating an upcoming relative clause. Brain activity will be recorded via EEG while participants read sentences in Mandarin, in order to track the dynamics of predictive processing throughout the sentence. Participants will also complete a battery of tests in order to examine whether engaging in structure prediction is modulated by individual differences in linguistic and cognitive abilities, shedding light on the individual properties which may affect language comprehension.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, \"head-final\" languages like Mandarin, in which the presence of a syntactic phrase is not marked at the beginning of the phrase, appear to present a challenge to strong incrementality. This dissertation project uses electroencephalography (EEG), a brain-imaging technique with millisecond-level temporal resolution, to examine whether strongly incremental processing in languages such as Mandarin Chinese is facilitated by utilizing linguistic cues to predict syntactic structures before information in the sentence confirming the presence of the structure is encountered. This project also examines to what extent individuals vary with regard to their ability to process predictive cues and engage in prediction, informing our understanding of the mechanisms supporting incremental sentence processing and shedding new light on the extent and sources of individual variation in language processing.</p>\n<p>The current study examined the processing of a complex syntactic structure, relative clauses (such as the underlined part of \"the library <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">where Lisi used to borrow books\"</span>) in Mandarin. Due to the syntactic properties of Mandarin, Mandarin relative clauses initially look like simple sentences, and it is only toward the end of the phrase that the relative clause marker 'de' appears that confirms the presence of a relative clause (see image 1a-b). This study examined whether the presence of an upcoming relative clause structure can be predicted using a linguistic cue, temporal mismatch which precedes the relative clause (e.g., the Mandarin equivalent of \"Next month, Lisi used to ...\", as apparent temporal mismatches can be resolved as well-formed Mandarin sentences if a relative clause appears, as shown in image (1a).</p>\n<p>The result of the EEG study (N=74 native Mandarin-speaking adults, tested at Hong Kong Polytechnic University) reveal that native speakers are indeed able to use temporal mismatch as a cue to anticipate that a relative clause is upcoming. When a temporal mismatch cue is present before the relative clause, we observed a reduced P600 effect, as shown in Figure 1. P600 is a brain response that provides an index of how unexpected the relative clause is; the reduction in P600 observed when a temporal mismatch cue was available indicates that the relative clause had been anticipated.</p>\n<p>Upon encountering the temporal mismatch itself, one type of mismatch involving tense marking (the suffix -<em>guo</em>) yielded P600, while responses to the other type, involving an adverb (<em>cengjing</em>), varied across individuals: those with stronger linguistic abilities showed a more negative-going response to the mismatch, while those with less strong linguistic abilities showed a more positive-going response. These findings suggest that the two types of temporal mismatch are processed differently, and reveal individual differences in the processing of temporal mismatch. The prediction of the relative clause itself was not robustly modulated by individual differences in linguistic or cognitive abilities, suggesting that relative clause prediction may be a fundamental aspect of Mandarin sentence processing which not limited to those individuals with the strongest linguistic or cognitive abilities.</p>\n<p>In sum, this project presents the intellectual merit of increasing our understanding of how incremental sentence processing is achieved, providing evidence that the brain rapidly uses predictive mechanisms to facilitate the processing of complex syntactic structures. This research adopted a rigorous, cognitive neuroscience approach, examining the dynamics of processing at both the temporal mismatch itself and at the relative clause, and included an examination of individual differences. Our results revealed that native speakers indeed engage in the predictive processing of syntactic structure using temporal mismatch as a linguistic cue facilitating the anticipation of upcoming structure. Moreover, our results shed new light on the extent to which different temporal markers are processed using the same mechanisms, and inform to what extent the processing of temporal mismatch and relative clause prediction are impacted by individual differences in linguistic and cognitive abilities.
