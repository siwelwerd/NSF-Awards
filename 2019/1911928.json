 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The MEMBERS program at Hampton University will enhance mathematical reasoning in the Departments of Biology and Marine and Environmental Sciences. The interdisciplinary programs, seminars, workshop experiences and novel activities will be leveraged to recruit, train and prepare underrepresented minority students as the next generation of integrative scientist. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the MEMBERS program is to develop the foundation of discipline-specific quantitative skills to facilitate students in the Marine, Biological, and Environmental sciences to become well-rounded members of the scientific community. Emphasis will be placed on the application of major-specific mathematics, graphical, and computer programming skills in existing courses, create new upper-level research-based course offerings, and support experiential learning opportunities for students via the support of undergraduate internships. Additionally, the program will provide support in the development of written and oral communication skills and financial literacy in the sciences, as these skills are essential to the communication of science to professional and public audiences, and for planning and managing STEM careers.  New courses will be incorporated into the departments? curricula; new teaching and learning infrastructure will be used to modernize existing courses; and inquiry-based senior projects and theses will benefit from enhanced facility with quantitative, graphical, and programming techniques. These strategies will extend the impact of this project beyond the lifetime of the funding cycle.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
