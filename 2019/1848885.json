 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one-year project is intended to enable the participation of students and early-career scientists from the U.S. at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) sponsored Chapman Conference on Scientific Challenges Pertaining to Forecasting Space Weather Including Extremes, which will be held in the Spring of 2019.  This AGU Chapman Conference will bring together the solar and Geospace communities to review and advance scientific understanding of solar-terrestrial relationships as they relate to forecasting space weather, from moderate to extreme conditions.  Recent years have brought new developments in modeling, observations, and scientific understanding to research that pertains to space weather, as well as renewed interest in space weather extremes. Despite its being a long-sought goal of the Space Physics and Aeronomy (SPA) community, forecasting space weather remains a challenge. \r\n\r\nThis AGU Chapman Conference is aimed at creating new community perspectives that will accelerate space weather forecasting as a scientific discipline and address the barriers that currently exist in its development.  At present, there is an urgent need to develop new approaches for predicting space weather extremes.  The outcome of this Conference is envisioned as guidance for the SPA community on new research directions to pursue that will yield major scientific benefits, as well as the potential for broader benefits to society.  The event organizers emphasize on the active participation and involvement of early-career scientists from the U.S. at the Conference, which is well aligned with the NSF's goal of developing the next generation of STEM scientists.  Furthermore, this AGU Chapman Conference directly addresses Goal 5 of the National Space Weather Action Plan: improve space-weather services through advancing understanding and forecasting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
