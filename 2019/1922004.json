 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large freshwater ecosystems are lifelines for a majority of the world's population, providing ecosystem goods and services critical to economies and livelihoods. Despite the important societal and economic benefits of these freshwater systems, the ability to predict impacts from ecosystem change and to evaluate tradeoffs is limited. A better understanding of conceptual and quantitative frameworks for evaluating the physical, biological, and social dynamics that sustain freshwater ecosystem services would allow for better management of these critical resources. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Washington will develop an innovative, culturally-aware STEM workforce fluent in state-of-the-art approaches for sustaining food-energy-water services in large river ecosystems and who are prepared to effectively safeguard ecosystem services for a growing world population. The project is driven by an urgent need for interdisciplinary scientists who can address current and future environmental problems by employing the quantitative tools required to integrate, model, and visualize complex datasets and often conflicting outcomes. The Future Rivers NRT training will include coursework and group activities that emphasize quantitative and interdisciplinary literacy. Students will engage in research that integrates transboundary rivers across the world, spanning a range of human disturbance and regional economic development regimes. The project anticipates training sixty (60) MS and PhD students, including eighteen (18) funded trainees, from disciplines across natural resource science, engineering, social science, health science, and policy.\r\n\r\nThe overall goals of the Future Rivers NRT project are to develop a trained workforce in 21st century quantitative and data science approaches to sustain and safeguard food-energy-water services in large river ecosystems, while researching new ways to better predict impacts and safeguard these resources.  The project will use numerical modeling and data science to catalyze new approaches for addressing the grand challenge of achieving sustainability in large Food, Energy, and Water Systems (FEWS). To integrate the research and learning, the Future Rivers project follows an active learning model that starts with the presentation of new information, followed by directed practice and exercises, and ends with the application of knowledge gained in a new context. Project training activities are centered around five primary educational objectives: 1) develop new technical and data science skills; 2) foster innovative interdisciplinary and international science integration; 3) improve trainee communication skills; 4) increase cultural awareness and inclusivity among faculty, trainees, and participants; and 5) create networks and opportunities for student career development. Specific project components focus on data science training and careers (courses, hackathon events, research summits, career fairs); communication and outreach skillsets (workshops, science communication film contests); equity and inclusivity training; and interdisciplinary river FEWS issues (courses, seminar series, and summer institutes that include some international locations).\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
