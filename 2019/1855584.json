 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides participant support to the Rocky Mountain Mathematics Consortium (RMMC) summer school, to be held in June 2019 at the University of Wyoming. The summer school provides an intellectually stimulating environment for graduate students and junior faculty from various backgrounds in the Rocky Mountain area to learn and discuss immensely important subjects in mathematical sciences. The RMMC summer school held annually at the University of Wyoming since 1996. It has a long tradition of encouraging the participation of female graduate students and early-career researchers in mathematical sciences. The theme for the 2019 RMMC summer school is \"Inverse problems in imaging''. The program of the 2019 summer school will take place over six days. It will include short courses on selected topics given by six lecturers. There will be working group sessions. The working groups will help channel scientific discussions and the exchange of ideas on open problems and challenges in the area of inverse problems and its applications in medical and geophysical imaging.\r\n \r\nThe program of  2019 RMMC summer school is split into several topics in inverse problems and imaging. The topics include regularization methods for inverse problems in imaging, optical imaging with biomedical applications, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and the D-bar method, statistical inference for geophysical imaging, and integral equations, sampling methods and their applications in inverse scattering. The invited lecturers are leaders in these fields. The summer school not only provides an opportunity for young scientists, including graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty in the Rocky Mountain area to interact with some of the best mathematical scientists in inverse problems and imaging sciences but also introduces the state-of-the-art techniques and research in inverse problems and image sciences to the Rocky Mountain scientific community. The web link to the RMMC summer school is https://www.uwyo.edu/mathstats/rmmc/summer19/index.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
