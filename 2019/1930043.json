 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing funding for registration and travel support to early career scientists, including assistant professors, post-docs, and graduate students, to attend the 2019 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) in Physical Metallurgy.  The Physical Metallurgy GRC is well-known for providing a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research at the frontier of materials science and engineering and for providing networking opportunities for research collaborations and career development. \r\n\r\nThis year's Physical Metallurgy GRC is subtitled Frontiers of Coupling Computation, Data Science, and Experiments in Physical Metallurgy, reflecting the community's commitment to the principles of the US Materials Genome Initiative(MGI) and the National Science Foundation's DMREF, MIP, and cross-cutting data science programs. The GRC will be preceded by an associated GRS) where early career researchers present and discuss their work and participate in mentoring and career-building activities. The GRS will be held on July 6-7, 2019 and the GRC will be on July 7-12, 2019, at Southern New Hampshire University, Hooksett NH. \r\n\r\nThe GRC and GRC program chairs and vice-chairs have engaged in extensive outreach within the community to attract a diverse group of attendees, as well as creating a program with speakers and discussion leaders who are not only scientific leaders in the field, but also have a reputation for building the broader community, welcoming innovative ideas, and engaging well with early career scientists and engineers. A primary goal of the Physical Metallurgy GRC is to explore some of the most important advances in coupling computation, data science and experiments to enhance depth of our scientific understanding and the rate of its acquisition.  \r\n\r\nAnother aim is to explore potential intersections of emerging technologies and methods to frame essential questions regarding how these intersections might further develop and how collaborative efforts might be configured to take full advantage of the power of their coupling.  The GRC and the associated GRS will help accelerate the design and development of advanced materials to enhance US manufacturing competitiveness, in strong support of the NSF focus on MGI, embodied in the DMREF, MIP, and other cross-cutting programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
