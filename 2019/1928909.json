 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies primarily in its ability to stimulate growth across multiple industries. The membrane filtration technology developed allows for the separation of components of interest and value in the oil & gas, food & beverage, life sciences, textiles, and semiconductor manufacturing spaces in a more efficient manner than the methods in use today. By replacing these more expensive and energy intensive processes, the technology can provide a significant cost savings to the industrial end user, thereby generating surplus revenue, increased hiring capacity, and facilitating growth. In addition, the project will yield a societal benefit by providing a more effective and energy efficient approach for industrial process separations and wastewater treatment.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project further develops a robust membrane filtration technology. The membrane consists of commonly available thin-sheet silicon through which nanoscale pores are chemically etched using a simple patented process. These pores extend from one side of the silicon sheet to the other, thereby acting as channels through which water can flow. Molecules, particles, and other constituents of interest are rejected both by the physical size of the pores, and by the chemical character of the membrane surface, allowing for the removal, concentration, or separation of important components. The membrane offers a unique value proposition in that it combines a very small size cutoff offered by polymeric filters with the harsh environment compatibility of ceramic filters, while possessing excellent resistance to clogging and blockage. These properties enable low maintenance separation performance in a wide range of industrial applications where exposure to harsh environments such as high or low pH, organic solvents, and high temperatures is required.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
