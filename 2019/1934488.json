 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to assist US-based graduate students to attend the 2019 IEEE Computer Society International Symposium on Very Large Scale Integration (IEEE ISVLSI) in Miami, Florida. Participation in IEEE ISVLSI and similar conferences are valuable and important activities of the graduate school experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers, and exposes students to leading work and practical industry practices in this important area of research.  The long-term merits of this program's impact on very large scale integration within computing research are well established. \r\n\r\nThe conference will be held in Miami, Florida, July 15-17, 2019, will span three days and will consist of technical paper presentations, panels, posters, and a student research forum.  It will also feature keynote speeches from leading researchers and practitioners in the field.  \r\n\r\nStudent travel to conferences is an important activity. Funds will be dispersed with preference given to students who would not otherwise be able to attend the conference and students who are not already scheduled to present a paper, paying particular attention to diversity and relevance of the student's research interest.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
