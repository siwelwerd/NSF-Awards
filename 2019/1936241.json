 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is improving corrosion monitoring through development of a microbial corrosion monitor.  There are over 2.6 million miles of pipeline in the United States and microbial corrosion leads to substantial costs for the pipeline operators.  Currently, operators are alerted to a breakdown of product and begin corrosion testing using a combination of microbially influenced corrosion (MIC) kits, corrosion coupons, and laboratory testing. Results from corrosion testing can take weeks, during which time the microbial community can change and the corrosion mitigation strategy will be unsuccessful.  Development of a probe capable of immediately determining when microbial growth will cause corrosion could have a significant impact on corrosion management.  Such a probe could be of interest for consumers in oil and gas, water treatment, food production, and environmental monitoring.  There is already great demand in the corrosion monitoring industry for probes and monitors to access abiotic corrosion damage.  The next generation of corrosion monitors could very well be defined by the ability to incorporate real-time monitoring for microbial growth and its impact on corrosion\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on an innovative probe that is able to predict when microbial growth will lead to microbially influenced corrosion (MIC), before the onset of corrosion.  The MIC instrument developed here is comprised of a probe that can monitor type and severity of corrosion caused solely by microbial growth.  This is unique to our probe, as all other available probes cannot distinguish between abiotic and biotic corrosion.  The probe uses a combination of split-chamber/zero-resistance ammetry (ZRA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The data obtained by the probe is analyzed with a new algorithm that gives real-time corrosion rate data for biotic corrosion, determines the type of corrosion, and rates the biotic corrosion from low to severe.  The instrument can be used to quickly screen for the corrosion-causing ability of different organisms that are isolated from a sample.  This will allow operators to quickly determine which types of organisms are causing corrosion and allow them to deploy the proper biocide.  Immediate detection of MIC will allow for safer pipeline operation, decrease downtime, and decrease the overall cost of pipeline operation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

At upstream/midstream companies, there are around 1,700 Asset Integrity Managers who spend $320M on their corrosion monitoring/mitigation programs annually.
