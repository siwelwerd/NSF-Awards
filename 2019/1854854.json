 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division of the NSF, Professor Jason Shearer of the Department of Chemistry at University of Nevada, Reno is studying the influence of protonated sulfur ligands at the active sites of metalloenzymes.  This type of structure has recently been recognized as important in several metalloprotein active sites, yet its impact on structure and catalysis has not been well studied.  This project examines a number of well-defined synthetic nickel-sulfur compounds and evaluates their reactivity, structure and properties.  The research has impacts on the design and production of a number of catalytic systems, including those important in clean energy, commodity chemical, and pharmaceuticals.   In addition, the project provides an educational platform for the training of highly skilled workers in a number of Science, Technology, Education and Mathematics (STEM) fields.\r\n\r\nCysteinate-ligated metalloenzymes represent a diverse class of biomolecules that are involved in reactions ranging from electron transfer to hydrocarbon functionalization.  Recently, it was discovered that the active site of nickel-iron hydrogenase contains a protonated-coordinated nickel-sulfur bond.  This adds to a small, but growing number of enzymatic systems, such as nickel superoxide dismutase that contain this structural element.  This research group has recently shown that this feature is not only important in modulating the structure and properties of nickel-thiolate ligated systems, but can also be involved in reactions such as proton coupled electron transfer reactions.   This research seeks to understand the properties and reactivities of designed nickel containing small molecules and metallopeptide-based systems that contain the protonated nickel-sulfur bond.  A series of spectroscopic, computational, reactivity, and mechanistic studies are undertaken to understand these systems.   Information learned through these studies is used to rationally design systems with fine-tuned electronic and geometric structural properties that can perform specific reactions towards targeted substrates.",

Such structural elements are found in a number of biological and industrial systems involving processes as diverse as cellular response to oxidative stress, hydrogen gas production, and the removal of sulfur-containing molecules from gasoline. Our work specifically focused on the Ni(II)-S-R moiety (where S-R is a thiolate ligand), which can undergo reversible protonation forming the Ni(II)-S(H<sup>+</sup>)-R moiety. Such thiolate protonation events have been noted in a number of systems (nickel superoxide dismutase and [NiFe]-hydrogenase, for example), but their impact on the reactivity and physical properties of metal-containing systems have not been probed in any detail. Under this initiative, we have found that protonation of the thiolate ligand dramatically impacts the fundamental bonding properties of the nickel-center; the nickel-thiolate bond is modified in such a manner as to make the active-site more nickel-like and less sulfur-like. This is manifested in the manner in which the active-site reacts with substrate; reactions such as substrate reduction are promoted while oxidative damage to the ligand is avoided. In other-words, this work has demonstrated that thiolate-protonation event effectively \"turns-on\" beneficial reactions (substrate modification) while eliminating damaging side-reactions (ligand oxidative decomposition). In the course of this work, we have also developed a detailed mechanism for superoxide disproportionation by the metalloenzyme nickel superoxide dismutase. This mechanism is fundamentally different from other superoxide dismutases, and resolves several ambiguities concerning nickel superoxide dismutase itself. Tangentially related to the main goals of this project, under this award we have also explored fundamental bonding in copper-containing organometallic complexes. Such species have been employed to build complex organic molecules used in the pharmaceutical industry, for example. We have discovered that reductive elimination reactions from such species do not proceed as envisioned from the fundamental perspective of electron rearrangement; they are not reductive. Thus, efforts to design C-C bond forming schemes from such species focusing on enhancement of metal-site redox activity will be fundamentally flawed and unfruitful. To understand the systems investigated under this award, researchers in my group have been exposed to a large number of techniques in fields as diverse as: molecular biology, synthetic chemistry, spectroscopy, and computational chemistry/chemical theory. With the exception of a postdoctoral research fellow, who gained valuable mentoring and teaching experience in addition to new technical skills, this project has provided a broad, hands-on training platform for a number of undergraduate students (8 in total) in biological and inorganic-chemistry.
