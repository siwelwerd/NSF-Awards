 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science today is increasingly international.  International scientific organizations, such as the International Science Council (ISC) and its disciplinary unions, are a prime locus of international coordination, standard setting, and policymaking that underpin and are essential to scientific exchange. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS), through its Board on International Scientific Organizations (BISO), serves as the U.S. national member to the ISC and many of its member unions, and supports the critical role of U.S. participation in these organizations.  The international networks and collaborations related to the ISC and the unions provide our nation's scientists access to a global infrastructure, a global community of experts, and international resources.  The unions and the U.S. National Committees (USNCs) also foster international and transdisciplinary research collaboration and information exchange that lead to global sustainability and the development of next generation products.  Because the flow of information in science is multi-directional, these venues provide U.S. scientists a way to stay connected to sources of new discoveries and technologies abroad, which in turn foster discovery and innovation in the United States.\r\n\r\nBISO is responsible for developing and carrying out a robust and cohesive U.S. membership strategy in these organizations.  It will do so through four thematic objectives that are in line with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science: 1. NETWORKS: Working closely with the USNCs, BISO will identify and promote opportunities for U.S. scientists to engage in international networks, and for U.S. and/or international organizations to work together.  Its networks and close associations allow BISO to be aware of, create, and act on synergies and emerging opportunities between USNCs and the international scientific organizations, as well as to guide and influence international organizations. 2.  SCIENCE: BISO and the USNCs will actively promote science and research, both within and across disciplines.  BISO and the USNCs will organize activities individually and with other partner entities and organizations that explore areas at the frontier of science and technology, and/or topics at the intersection of science, technology, and policy.  Continued effective leadership will enable the U.S. and the NASEM to advance science by addressing societal and global challenges. 3.  WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT: BISO and the USNCs will create opportunities for U.S. students and early career scientists to participate in fellowships and other opportunities related to international organizations and programs.  These fellowships will involve a diverse group of applicants and awardees.  The programs will also involve opportunities for USNC members and senior scientists engaged with unions to mentor U.S. early career scientists.  Many U.S. early career scientists who participate in the programs will continue to be engaged in international programs and collaborations.  4.  INTERNATIONAL MOBILITY: Recognizing that science is global and that both the United States and the world's scientific community benefit from the international circulation of scientists, BISO will assist, within the context of our mission, foreign scientists at all career stages who are experiencing U.S. visa difficulties.  BISO also will promote the United States as a study, meeting, and conference destination and provide up-to-date advice to visa applicants and meeting organizers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
