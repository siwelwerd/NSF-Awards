 "awd_abstract_narration": "Materials play an important role in the areas of biopharmaceuticals, medicine, the environment and energy storage.  The structure of materials at the nanoscale play an important role in how these materials behave at more macroscopic, physically relevant scales.  Thus, it is important to get high fidelity images of materials at the smallest possible scales. A state-of-the art scanning/transmission electron microscope (S/TEM), acquired through this grant, will enable visualization and chemical characterization of a broad variety of materials at the nanoscale.  This information will be used to understand material functionalities, as well as develop new materials for applications in diagnostics and targeted drug delivery, pollutant capture and batteries.  The instrument will serve several universities and industries through existing and new interactions. Dozens of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and undergraduates will be trained to use this cutting edge analytical tool, preparing them to contribute effectively to the fast-paced advances in materials science and engineering research.\r\n\r\nThe transmission electron microscope will be used to image (a) biocompatible polymer beads loaded with drugs and magnetic nanoparticles for combined therapeutics and diagnostics (b) silver nanoparticles exposed to bacteria to uncover the causes behind their biocidal properties (c) bioengineered proteins and cell surfaces, to get a fundamental understanding of protein function (d) evolving structures in lithium ion battery electrodes, to be able to design higher energy density batteries that are safe and long lasting (e) nanoparticle formation and evolution in solution, to further the design of softeners for hard water, and for consumer products. The S/TEM will be a key enabler for all of these projects.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by CBET-MRI Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
