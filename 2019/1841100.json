 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most pressing problems in understanding Earth?s climate is solar irradiance: the amount of light emitted by the Sun. Solar irradiance is the sole source of heating on Earth. If we want to understand our climate, we must understand the source of the sunlight that warms our planet. The proposed work will examine two different high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic models of the Sun in an effort to understand how magnetic variability at small scales (down to tens of kilometers) can affect irradiance. The team will compare the results of the two different models to high-resolution measurements of the Sun from the NSF?s Dunn Solar Telescope and from NASA?s Solar Dynamics Observatory. The result of this work will be a greater understanding of solar irradiance variability, which will lead to a better understanding of the external influences on the Earth?s climate. This work will form the basis of a graduate student?s PhD thesis.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work is to examine the results of two different three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar photosphere for solar irradiance at small (~10 km) scales. Simulated spectra will be generated by BAERI?s StellarBox code and from NCAR/HAO?s MURaM code and compared to observations of the Sun from the Dunn Solar Telescope and from the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft. The team will assess the contribution to solar irradiance in certain spectral ranges from magnetic features too small to be resolved in moderate-resolution imaging. They will also examine the effects of different numerical schemes and approximations used in the two different MHD codes to predicted overall irradiance. The overall objective will be to identify the most suitable numerical contributions for advancing irradiance reconstruction and stellar atmosphere models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe primary goal of the project was to compare high spatial resolution observations (taken with the NSF's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, DKIST) with simulations of the solar photosphere. In order to make such comparisons, the portions of the electromagnetic spectrum that the telescope observes have to be synthesized based on the physical conditions in simulation, such as the plasma temperature, pressure, and flow speeds. This kind of forward modeling of the spectrum is computationally expensive because it must account for, as a function of photon frequency, space, time, the interaction between the photons and the plasma as they travel from deep in the atmosphere out into space. Once the observed spectra are synthesized, however, they can be used to understand differences between the physical processes occurring on the Sun and those in the simulations.\n\n\nUnder this project we synthesized the FeI 6301/6302 lines and the blue continuum radiation that DKIST observes. Under a sister NSF project, we synthesized additional DKIST passbands. An example of those synthesis efforts is shown in the attached figure. In this project we used these synthesized spectra to examine two outstanding questions: how the small-scale magnetic fields in the solar photosphere effect the brightness of the Sun, which varies slightly over the solar magnetic cycle, and where the small-scale waves recently discovered with DKIST originate. We found that a key method used to assess the influence of small-scale fields on the Sun's brightness appears to be quite unreliable, and that the waves observed by DKIST likely have their source, not in the solar photosphere as we had expected but, in the solar atmosphere itself.\n\n\nThese kinds of direct comparisons between simulations and observations, via spectral synthesis, can thus help us to both test the validity of models being used and interpret the observations themselves.\n\n\nOur findings raise further questions. How do we model the smallest scale brightness contributions to the Sun's global irradiance? What do fields even below DKIST's exquisite spatial resolution contribute to solar variability? What fraction of the acoustic wavefield in the solar atmosphere travels upward from below to deposit heat there, and what fraction is locally excited? Do the local excitation events play a role in energy redistribution in the solar chromosphere?\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MarkPRast\n"
