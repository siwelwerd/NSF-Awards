 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Dr. Bradley L. Nilsson from University of Rochester and Dr. Cristiano Dias from New Jersey Institute of Technology to study the structure and molecular driving forces promoting the assembly of beta-sheet peptides.  Peptides are naturally occurring biological molecules that are found in all living organisms.  In cells, they perform many biological functions, for example acting as hormones.  Beta-sheets are a common structure found in peptide assemblies associated with many human diseases, most notable of which is Alzheimer's disease.  In this work, co-assembly of two peptides that are mirror images of one another is studied using complementary experimental and computational techniques.  These efforts may provide critical insight into the molecular-scale interactions that dictate the assembly of both natural and artificial beta-sheets.  The this research could simplify and guide efforts to rationally design and synthesize the next generation of nanomaterials with peptides that are precisely organized. Outreach activities associated with this work includes an inquiry based mini-course on hydrogels called \"To Gel or Not To Gel: The Science of Slime\" which is conducted at both institutions.  Additionally, the two research teams host high school interns for six weeks during the summer to provide mentoring and increase interest in scientific research and chemical sciences in general. This work may provide significant societal benefits because it has the potential to provide insight into disease mechanisms that involve beta-sheet self-assembly, such as in Alzheimer's disease and amyloidosis in general.\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on obtaining fundamental understanding of the structure and molecular forces driving the co-assembly of L- and D-peptides sequences into rippled beta-sheet nanofibrils. This enables the rational design of new peptide sequences that can form rippled beta-sheet nanofibril systems. In the first objective, complementary experimental and theoretical methods are used to characterize the comparative structures of pleated beta-sheet and rippled beta-sheet nanofibrils.  The second objective exploits theory in the computationally-directed assessment and design of rippled beta-sheet nanofibrils from L- and D-peptide sequences. The knowledge obtained may be applicable not only to these specific materials, but also to understanding the role of beta-sheet structures in amyloid self-assembly and in protein folding in general. This work may provide significant societal benefits because it has the potential to provide insight into disease mechanisms that involve beta-sheet self-assembly, such as in Alzheimer's disease and amyloidosis in general.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It has been appreciated for decades that a wide variety of peptides and proteins self-assemble into beta-sheet nanofibrils. These nanofibrils, composed of naturally occurring peptide stereoisomers (so-called L-peptides) adopt a commonly found pleated beta-sheet structure within fibrils that are referred to as cross-beta structures. Cross-beta structures are characteristic of protein misfolding amyloid disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease and are also found in designed functional biomaterials. In 1953, Pauling and Corey predicted that mixtures of L-peptides with their mirror-image D-peptide stereoisomers (which are not common in living organisms) would form a new type of beta-sheet, the \"rippled beta-sheet.\" The rippled beta-sheet motif was predicted to have alternating L- and D-peptides and to have a unique structure and properties relative to pleated beta-sheets (see <strong>Figure 1</strong> for examples of pleated and rippled beta-sheets).<em> </em>In the ensuing decades, rippled beta-sheets were rarely studied, and thus, little was understood about the molecular structure of rippled beta-sheets and the molecular interactions that favor coassembly of chiral enantiomers into rippled beta-sheets instead of sorting of the enantiomers into mirror-image pleated beta-sheets. The purpose of this work was to obtain fundamental understanding of the rippled beta-sheet motif at the molecular level to provide deeper insight into protein-folding phenomena generally and will also enable the design of next generation multicomponent materials.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> Supramolecular nanofibrils of self-assembled <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">pleated</span> beta-sheet peptides have been a topic of significant research interest due to the interesting emergent properties of these materials. Although Pauling predicted the formation of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">rippled</span> beta<em>-</em>sheets in 1953, these supramolecular materials were nearly completely unexplored and poorly understood until recently. The research objectives of this work reflected the need to address gaps in understanding regarding both pleated and rippled-beta sheet self-assembly. The Objectives were: 1) To characterize the comparative structures of pleated beta-sheet and rippled beta-sheet nanofibrils using complementary experimental and theoretical methods. 2) To exploit theory in the computation-directed assessment and design of rippled beta-sheet nanofibrils from L- and D-peptide sequences. These Objectives have been accomplished using a selected set of peptide sequences. This effort has provided critical insight into the fundamental molecular-scale interactions that dictate the supramolecular assembly of both natural pleated beta-sheets and unnatural rippled beta-sheets. This insight is applicable not only to these specific materials, but also to understanding the role of beta-sheet structures in amyloid self-assembly and in protein folding more generally.
