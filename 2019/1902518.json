 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Guiding Underrepresented Students to Opportunities in STEM (GUSTO-STEM) project will recruit, retain, and graduate students from the college's Chemical Technician Program to meet the needs of the local industry. Milwaukee Area Technical College (MATC) has well equipped facilities and is well connected to local industry, but historically has not prepared sufficient graduates to meet local workforce needs. To recruit more students, the project will work with advisors in the Milwaukee Public Schools and employ a traveling public outreach team to interact directly with prospective students. To improve retention, the project will host a two-week summer bridge/boot camp to help students transition to college. An advisor will be assigned to assist the Chem Tech faculty in purposefully building the new Chem Tech students into a cohort by grouping the new students together in core classes and allowing them to socially interact in a dedicated meeting space. To increase graduation rates, the project will adapt and apply guided pathways to the Chem Tech program that help students complete degrees in a timely fashion. By supporting these students through this rigorous two-year program, the project will offer them the opportunity to make on average, $50,000 per year, with full benefits, while providing them with opportunities to advanced degrees if they return for further study. A broader impact of this project will be to dramatically enhance the economic mobility of students, who typically come from low-income families.\r\n\r\nThe strategies to be used to increase the number of Chem Tech graduates fall into two categories: enhanced recruiting and improved retention. Recruiting efforts will include collaborations with Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) at nine STEM-focused high schools with whom MATC already has a working relationship. MATC recruiters will work with MPS guidance counselors to steer future students towards the Chem Tech program. The project leaders from MATC will facilitate engaging \"STEM Circus\" events as public outreach that promotes the Chem Tech program. Cohort building will be encouraged and supported as a retention strategy through a pre-first semester transitional boot camp, small group tutoring sessions, coaching, mentoring, and socializing during formal and informal programming events at MATC and at several industrial partner sites. Having a dedicated learning spaces on campus dedicated to Chem Tech students and the opportunity to share science with the community through the STEM Circuses will promote a learning community that feels connected to the program and the college. In addition to providing Chem Tech students with industry lab field trips, industrial partners have committed to providing these students with critical soft-skills training: developing professionalism, resume writing, interview preparation, and holding mock interviews.  \r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nChemical Technicians are in great demand, particularly in Southeastern Wisconsin.  The Chemical Technician program at MATC has fed this pipeline for over 30 years.  For a variety of reasons, however, this program at MATC was not lately producing sufficient graduates to meet industry need.

The pandemic greatly curtailed the number of circuses (from 6 to 2), but our \"pandemic pivot\" was to develop \"Chemistry Demonstration\" videos, which also led to the development of a program descriptive advertising video.  As another approach to get into schools, our grant coordinator and one of our co-PI's developed program description cards which were distributed in the schools by MATC counselors at those schools.\n\nThe proposed retention plan envisioned Chem Tech student support from the summer before entering college, through courses and into the workforce. The pandemic prevented the summer transition to college program, but the grant provided for the hiring of a part-time success coach for the Chem Tech students and chemistry tutors for the tutoring center (when they could be found).\n\nAssuring that our graduates had full time jobs upon graduation, the project team made good use of our industrial partners (AeroTek, now Actalent, Millipore Sigma, and PPG).   Each year our partners held virtual (during pandemic) or face to face workshops on job seeking, resume writing, and successful interviews.\n\nOur final year (2021-2022) allowed us a wonderful opportunity:  A chemistry circus at one of our Milwaukee Public Schools partners (Rufus King H.S.).  Seven of our Chem Tech students gave a series of demonstrations and talked to engaged students asking questions about the field and the program.  The Chem Tech students expressed the desire to do more of these Circuses - even after the grant ends.\n\nOur primary indicator of success for this project is the number of graduates and how many left MATC to an awaiting job.  Our ambitious goal was 30 graduates by program end.  We graduated 10, but all took good paying industry jobs upon grduation.  For context: in the four years 2015 to 2018, MATC had 14 graduates (with 0 in 2017).  We had one graduate in 2019 and 2020.  Two graduates in 2021 and four in 2022.  The trend is encouraging.  Lastly, we graduated 2 students in May of 2023, but have 3 or so preparing to graduate in December, which would give us yet another small increase in the right direction.  The pandemic certainly hurt our project, but tenacity and hard work led to an encouraging modicum of success.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric A Hagedorn"
