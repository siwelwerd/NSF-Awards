 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to explore fundamental communication and sensing technologies to transform the ordinary physical world into a connected, intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Despite multiple generations of evolution, digital devices still demand substantial user involvement for battery charging and network setup, and current technologies are not yet ready to make everyday things connected and intelligent. To address the networking challenges, this project will work technology for ultra-thin paper-like communication tags, composed of a mm-scale radio chip along with power harvesting unit, printable flexible antennas, and printable energy storage unit. The tag, referred to as Networked Smart Paper (NSP), can potentially be woven into clothes or attached on plain objects, thus encompassing humans or things into the IoT. The resulting hardware and software will be made fully open-source and become a community resource, to benefit the relevant industries in wireless systems, radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFIC), and printed electronics. This project will engage students in experimental IoT research through the summer research internship program and outreach to under-represented groups. \r\n\r\n    The proposed NSP project aims to extend the IoT vision beyond the current-generation mobile devices, by addressing cross-disciplinary challenges in low-power RFIC, printable electronics, and wireless networking. It will renovate the IoT radio architecture and network protocol design, under the constraints of extremely low-power, extremely thin/flexible form-factor, and compatibility with the legacy network infrastructure.  In particular, NSP explores a novel \"slim radio\" architecture, which adopts on-off-keying-like energy-efficient modulation, but remains compatible with the WiFi physical layer through signal waveform approximation. In addition, NSP will realize a slim network stack through association-free network management and application-specific addressing.  NSP's ability to reuse the massive legacy WiFi infrastructure helps eliminate the deployment barrier that has been hindering IoT deployment.  In addition, NSP explores chip-level optimization for the slim radio architecture, aiming to achieve up to three orders of magnitude lower power consumption compared with legacy WiFi transceiver chips. Unlike existing passive radio architectures (e.g., Radio Frequency Identifier tags and backscatter), NSP supports channelization (thus enabling coexistence and frequency reuse); it can power both the communication and computation (network stack) operations, by scavenging and storing the energy from intermittent ambient radio frequency signals. The miniaturized radio chip, printable antenna and energy storage units together enable ultra-thin form factor, making NSP a truly wearable and attachable IoT device for humans and things.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The core innovation is the development of paper-like communication and sensing tags called Networked Smart Paper (NSP), which can be attached to ordinary objects. These tags combine miniature radio chips, power harvesting/storage units, and printable antennas and radio frequency (RF) metamaterials. The intellectual merits of the project are reflected in 4 major milestones:</p>\r\n<p class=\"TextBody\">1. Ultra-low-power IoT radio architecture enabled by asymmetric communication. We developed SlimWiFi (Fig. 1), a novel asymmetric communication system that enables ultra-low-power IoT devices to communicate with standard WiFi access points (APs). The key innovation lies in its ability to use simple OOK (On-Off Keying) signals that can be decoded by ordinary WiFi APs without hardware modifications. By eliminating power-hungry components like DACs, ADCs, and PLLs, SlimWiFi achieves remarkable power efficiency - consuming only 90 &mu;W, approximately 1000 times less than conventional WiFi radios. Our prototype demonstrates reliable communication over 60 meters with data rates around 100 kbps, proving the feasibility of reusing existing WiFi infrastructure for ultra-low-power IoT connectivity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"TextBody\">2. Passive printable smart surface for radar joint communication. We created RoS, a PCB-fabricated passive surface that enables direct communication with automotive radars (Fig. 2). This innovation addresses a fundamental limitation in radar technology by allowing infrastructure to convey digital information to vehicles, similar to how visual road signs work for cameras. RoS uses a novel spatial encoding scheme and retrodirective reflection to achieve reliable communication at distances up to 6 meters with bit error rates below 0.6%. The design requires no discrete RF components and can be extended to work with various RF communication protocols, making it a versatile solution for intelligent transportation systems.</p>\r\n<p class=\"TextBody\">3. 3D printable metasurface for mmWave network coverage expansion. To address the coverage limitations of millimeter-wave networks, we developed MilliMirror, a cost-effective 3D-printed metasurface that can redirect mmWave signals in non-traditional ways (Fig. 3). Using a closed-form model, we can synthesize arbitrary reflecting beam patterns by customizing the surface's microstructures. Our field experiments with commercial 802.11ad devices demonstrate that MilliMirror can effectively overcome various non-line-of-sight scenarios, including outdoor-to-indoor coverage and around-the-corner propagation. The solution is particularly promising due to its low cost and compatibility with existing protocols. Furthermore, we have extended the solution to a novel MetaSight metasurface, which enables non-line-of-sight radar sensing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"TextBody\">4. Extremely wideband mmWave backscatter tag. We developed UniScatter (Fig. 4), a breakthrough in mmWave backscatter technology that operates across an unprecedented frequency range (24-81 GHz). The design overcomes fundamental limitations of traditional resonant antenna-based tags by using a novel metamaterial structure with graphene capacitors for signal modulation. UniScatter achieves consistent performance across multiple frequency bands with a 70-degree field of view and 30-meter range. This innovation enables a single tag to work with various mmWave communication and sensing systems, making it particularly valuable for applications like autonomous driving and smart infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p class=\"TextBody\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"TextBody\">The project has generated significant broader impacts through four key areas of engagement and outreach:</p>\r\n<p class=\"TextBody\">1. Research dissemination and industry engagement. Our research findings have been published in prestigious venues including Science Advances, ACM SIGCOMM, MobiCom, IPSN, IMWUT, and USENIX NSDI. Through UCSD's Center for Wireless Communications (CWC) and the San Diego 5G&amp;Beyond Forum, we have established valuable industry partnerships, leading to collaborative projects with companies like Samsung Research America. These partnerships have helped bridge the gap between academic research and practical applications.</p>\r\n<p class=\"TextBody\">2. Workforce development and career advancement. The project has been instrumental in developing next-generation researchers in mmWave communication, networking, and sensing. Six PhD students and one postdoctoral scholar have received comprehensive training across multiple disciplines. Notable achievements include two participants securing faculty positions at prestigious universities, including Johns Hopkins University and the University of Virginia. The interdisciplinary nature of projects like SlimWiFi has enabled students to develop diverse skill sets spanning radio architecture, IC design, circuits simulation, FPGA programming, and analog IC design/testing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"TextBody\">3. Diversity and educational outreach. We have made significant efforts to promote engineering careers among underrepresented populations. Through the UCSD ENLACE program, we hosted several groups of students from the Baja California region for a six-week research experience in mobile sensor programming. We partnered with Texas Region 12 GEAR-UP programs to support underprivileged students, hosting field trips and an engineering Summer Camp. These initiatives have provided valuable exposure to STEM fields for students from underserved communities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"TextBody\">4. Educational integration project outcomes have been incorporated into several graduate-level courses, enriching the curriculum for students across various disciplines.
