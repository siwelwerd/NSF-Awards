 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proteins in biological systems communicate in a type of \"chemical braille\", where molecular-scale bumps and grooves of one protein molecule is read by the physical interaction of another protein. Detailed understanding of the molecular-level communications of these protein-protein interactions is necessary to determine the fundamental rules governing both normal and abnormal cellular function.  The  ability to both characterize and manipulate these interactions at the molecular level has proven challenging. The Pomerantz laboratory at the University of Minnesota works to understanding the chemical details of protein-protein interactions, with the long-term goal of  developing ways to stop protein-protein communications that result in harmful cellular functions. To achieve this goal, novel fluorine-based \"probe\" protein molecules report on difficult-to-detect protein-protein interactions due to their intrinsic responsiveness in differing chemical environments. Research efforts are integrated with educational activities through course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) designed to increase student success and increase retention in science-technology-engineering-mathematics career paths. Broadened impact of the research project occurs through collaborations with Gustavus Adolphus College, as well as an educational bootcamp that expands undergraduate student exposure to chemical biology research and mentoring by the Pomerantz team.\r\n\r\nThe Chemistry of Life Process Program in the Division of Chemistry at the NSF is funding Dr. William Pomerantz from the University of Minnesota- Twin Cities for development of fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) methods for detecting, quantifying, and defining novel modes of interactions at transcription factor protein-protein interfaces, including those that involve epigenetic regulatory proteins. The long-term research goals of the Pomerantz team are to develop chemical tools to probe the biological roles of transcription factor protein interactions with specific interest in epigenetic gene regulation. This research combines fluorine-19 NMR approaches developed in the Pomerantz lab with additional biophysical methods to characterize native and synthetic ligand binding interactions. This research provides a detailed understanding of the role of aromatic amino acids involved in the protein allosteric network for regulating the KIX protein-protein interaction domain of CREB binding protein (CBP). A recent discovery of the Pomerantz team is the identification of a new protein interaction site on the KIX domain targeted by synthetic small molecules. A key fundamental question to be addressed is the nature of the interaction for other proteins with the newly discovered small-molecule binding site. The Pomerantz team structurally characterizes this site by NMR and uses photo-crosslinking and proteomic methods to evaluate if other proteins occupy this binding site for allosterically regulating KIX function. They evaluate potential domain-domain interactions when studied first as separate domains and ultimately the full-length construct. The research aims are integrated with an educational objective of creating course-based undergraduate research experiences, which result from authentic undergraduate chemistry student research experiences afforded by the study of protein-ligand interactions with fluorine-19 NMR methods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\n\nThis proposal lays the framework for a long-term goal of dissecting the molecular mechanisms used by proteins to regulate how our genes are turned on and off. One key innovation of this proposal was the use of an element not found in nature, fluorine, and its incorporation into proteins. The Pomerantz lab has used this bioorthogonal nucleus, 19F, through developing highly sensitive 19F NMR methods for analysis of native and synthetic ligand interactions with proteins involved in gene transcription.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings and Intellectual Merit\n\n\nSeveral significant accomplishments that were achieved during this funding period were the incorporation of fluorinated amino acids into two protein domains of the CREB-binding protein (CBP). 19F NMR was used to discover a new small molecule binding site on a domain of CBP called the KIX domain. This research then led to the identification of the same binding site being used by the bioactive natural product garcinolic acid. Both research findings have been disseminated in peer reviewed articles. A second aspect of the research was the characterization of how a synthetic inhibitor of the CBP protein interacted with the second domain of the protein, called a bromodomain. Structural insights into how the inhibitor engaged the protein was able to help rationalize the differential bioactivity of the inhibitor versus published inhibitors in the literature. This research was also disseminated in a peer reviewed journal.\n\n\n\n\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n\nThe Pomerantz lab made several significant contributions regarding the broader impacts of their proposal. During the course of this research, they have helped translate their research into the undergraduate teaching laboratory at Gustavus Adolphus College. In collaboration with Prof. Scott Bur, using their fluorinated proteins, they were able to develop a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) which has run for five years. Such experiences are essential to undergraduates as such authentic research experiences have been demonstrated to increase self-efficacy and retention in STEM fields. In addition, one undergraduate from this study continued to collaborate with both the Bur and Pomerantz laboratories working on different fluorinated protein which uses one of her synthesized small molecules. Her findings resulted in an additional coauthored publication. Finally, this research has helped support undergraduate researchers from underrepresented groups through summer research experiences.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/26/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: WilliamCPomerantz\n"
