 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wood fuels are used as an energy source for cooking, heating, and small-scale industrial activities by a large number of people in the developing world. As populations increase, the effects of burning wood or other biomass on the vitality of forests, air quality, and human health or well-being can be severe. This project investigates the dynamic connections among these areas of concern and evaluates strategies that can alleviate problems in the future. It examines how people use forest resources for energy and whether these habits are altered by the introduction of more efficient cooking stoves and other new technologies. The effects on forest condition will be examined through direct measurements and modeling. Measurements of air quality will determine how pollution levels will be affected. The field sites are in Malawi and the results will be scaled up to determine the possible changes in the larger regions of eastern and southern Africa. This research has the potential to improve forest condition and air quality in areas at risk of severely declining environmental conditions, and improve the quality of life for large numbers of people who depend upon these resources.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to investigate linkages between the use of biomass energy in Southern Africa and its coupled impacts on human, terrestrial, and atmospheric systems. Quantitative and qualitative field observations of both human and natural systems, scenario development, and modeling of both the atmospheric and land-use changes will further examine these linkages and quantify the magnitude of human influence. The project will explore how natural and human system resilience can be enhanced at local, national and regional scales assessing the impact of a scalable household energy intervention. This study couples both terrestrial and atmospheric systems with the human system, providing a new dimension on human-environment relationships.   It also adds new insights into the relative effects of a wide array of biomass energy uses on land-use land-cover changes, air quality, and human well-being. The project also evaluates a scalable household energy intervention targeted at the poorest and most vulnerable households, and models its influence on terrestrial and atmospheric systems in future scenarios.",

Biomass is typically burned using technologies with low combustion efficiencies, putting pressure on forests, and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), with associated impacts on regional climate. Given the slow pace of energy transitions in this context, understanding the role of biomass reliance in supporting and constraining livelihoods, contributing to deforestation and forest degradation, and influencing GHGs can inform policies that seek to improve energy access, conserve resources, and mitigate climate change. This project integrated quantitative program evaluation, land use land cover change analysis (LULCC), air pollutant emissions measurements and ambient monitoring, and regional climate modeling to understand how reliance on biomass impacts human well-being and environmental conditions in the context of growing concern over regional climate change and its impacts.</p>\n<p>To understand the effect of woody biomass consumption on human wellbeing we evaluated a Government of Malawi program designed to reduce fuelwood consumption for ultra-poor households. We find high demand for energy saving cooking technologies among ultra-poor households. We did not find evidence of reductions in the quantity of fuelwood used among those who adopted fuel saving technologies but did observe a food security benefit. When households? own energy efficient stoves they cook more frequently; an important benefit for households who often cook no meals or only one meal per day. We also find that ultra-poor households who receive unconditional cash transfer payments invest in improved energy sources including fuel saving stoves and battery and solar powered lights. This part of our project allows us to understand demand for fuel saving technologies and the benefits associated with them.</p>\n<p>We considered the influence of woody biomass reliance on terrestrial ecosystems. Our analysis of LULCC provides information on forest loss associated with biomass collection. In our study communities we used GPS trackers to understand spatial patterns of fuelwood collection and how they relate to LULCC. In areas with high rates of deforestation, people spend more time collecting fuelwood. Woody biomass collection is not a major driver of deforestation but does contribute to forest degradation. GPS data on fuelwood collection was integrated with data on LULCC, woodfuel demand, and end-user technologies to simulate the spatiotemporal impacts of woodfuel harvesting over dynamic landscapes, accounting for reduced consumption of woody biomass.&nbsp;This part of our project allows us to assess how forest cover and quality is affected by woodfuel collection, and to understand if interventions designed to reduce biomass consumption led to changes in the rate and extent of LULCC.</p>\n<p>We also consider the influence of woody biomass reliance on atmospheric systems. We established Malawi?s first ambient air quality monitoring network using low-cost monitors in four locations. We tested the performance of low-cost sensors to understand their potential for deployment in regions that lack robust air quality monitoring infrastructure. Overall, they performed well, but power and internet connectivity presented challenges in locations without reliable grid electricity and internet access. Our analysis of ambient air pollution over a period of four years underscores the strong influence of agricultural land preparation as the major contributor to regional air pollution and household biomass combustion as the major contributor to village-scale air pollution. A series of targeted emissions monitoring campaigns generated emissions profiles for combustion sources including household cooking, charcoal production, brick production and brewing. This part of our project provides localized data on the contribution of biomass combustion to air pollution relevant to much of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>\n<p>We are among the first to integrate land cover land use change data into regional climate models to assess the potential effect of energy transitions on regional climate change in Southern and East Africa. Data on energy saving technology uptake and air pollution are used to inform decision making and scenario building using the Weather Researching and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry. We developed a new version of the model with more accurate African land surface parameters that evaluate the influence of LULCC.&nbsp;We tested several energy transition scenarios to explore what scale and types of woody biomass saving interventions are needed to reduce regional climate change and find that even rapid household energy transitions are unlikely to alter the trajectory of climate change in the region.</p>\n<p>To date, the project has produced 19 peer-reviewed publications, with further papers in development. Several graduate and undergraduate students and two postdocs were trained in impact evaluation, land use land cover change, air pollution monitoring, and climate modeling. In addition, approximately 50 scholars from Malawi were trained in analysis of social ecological systems.&nbsp; An open access dynamic modeling tool (MoFuSS) is available for household energy projects to estimate LULCC associated with technology adoption. New versions of the Weather Researching and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry are available for applications in Africa.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/18/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Pamela&nbsp;Jagger</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1923568/1923568_10434198_1695052312810_CNHFieldTeam--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1923568/1923568_10434198_1695052312810_CNHFieldTeam--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Study Field Team\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1923568/1923568_10434198_1695052312810_CNHFieldTeam--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Study Field Team\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Study team from Lilongwe University of Natural Resources and Environment</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Maxwell Jamu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pamela&nbsp;Jagger</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Study Field Team</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1923568/1923568_10434198_1695049826207_AshleyArisense--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1923568/1923568_10434198_1695049826207_AshleyArisense--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Installing air quality monitors\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1923568/1923568_10434198_1695049826207_AshleyArisense--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Installing air quality monitors\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Then PhD student Ashley Bittner conducts maintenance on moderate-cost, solar-powered air quality monitoring equipment on a household roof in rural Mulanje, Malawi</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andrew Grieshop</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pamela&nbsp;Jagger</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Installing air quality monitors</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1923568/1923568_10434198_1695051893085_SESWorkshop--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1923568/1923568_10434198_1695051893085_SESWorkshop--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Social ecological systems workshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1923568/1923568_10434198_1695051893085_SESWorkshop--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Social ecological systems workshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Field visit to Dzalanyama Forest Reserve to observe charcoal production and deforestation</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lawrence Mtunda</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pamela&nbsp;Jagger</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Social ecological systems workshop</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1923568/1923568_10434198_1695052477301_CharcoalKiln--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1923568/1923568_10434198_1695052477301_CharcoalKiln--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Charcoal kiln\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1923568/1923568_10434198_1695052477301_CharcoalKiln--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Charcoal kiln\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Charcoal production process in Malawi</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Pam Jagger</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pamela&nbsp;Jagger</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Charcoal kiln</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
