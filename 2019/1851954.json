 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for starting a new REU Site at the University of Florida with a focus on computationally intensive research in astronomy and astrophysics. The new program will take advantage of cutting-edge supercomputing available at the University of Florida as well as the newly established Informatics Institute. In addition to working in areas of astronomy, students will develop computer skills that will prepare them for a wide range of careers. The program will recruit students nationally, but will place particular focus on regional students with otherwise limited research opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe research projects available to students include cosmological simulations of the growth of galaxies and their properties, simulations and analysis of cosmological microwave background observations using next generation ground-based experiments, and simulations of future space-based gravitational wave data and analysis. Students will be trained in the development and use of supercomputing codes and facilities with a focus on astrophysics. The skill set is transferable to a number of careers both in and outside of the STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
