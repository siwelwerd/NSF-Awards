 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Great Lakes provide the largest freshwater resource in the world, and Lake Superior is at the top of this critical watershed. Recent weather fluctuations, increases in surface and lake temperatures, ice cover and lake levels have had a tremendous impact on infrastructure in the Great Lakes region. Collaboration and interdisciplinary science is necessary to understand the dynamic relationships between ecosystem health, commerce and development.  The goal of this project is to conduct a conference series that will engage (1) interdisciplinary experts in coastal geography, geohazards, water quality, climate science, livelihoods, tourism, environmental history, sustainable business and adaptation planning; (2) practitioners, including local and regional planning staff, public sector stakeholders, and local and regional non-governmental organizations; and (3) industry leaders in tourism, mining, education, and real estate development. \r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes for this series include: 1) integrated stakeholder input to create multiple scenarios for sustainable coastal community development; 2) visualizations of those scenarios created by landscape architects; and 3) new ways to achieve sustainable development along the south shore of Lake Superior.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The combination of heavy rain events, high water levels, strong winds and big waves on Lake Superior make the risk of shoreline erosion and coastal damages imminent. Marquette County is important to the south shore of Lake Superior because it is the largest county in Michigan and one of the largest counties east of the Mississippi River, encompassing 1,873 square miles of land area. Marquette County is also one of the most populated areas in the Upper Peninsula and serves as the cultural and economic capital for northern Michigan.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Facing a dynamic and rapidly changing climate requires collaboration and capital ? social, political, physical and financial capital. <strong>Our team hosted a three-part workshop series to move scientists and stakeholders from historical conditions to a vision for the future with actionable recommendations for sustainable coastal development in an era of dynamic climate change.</strong> The conference process offered decision-makers access to the latest coastal research related to issues of rural economic development, climate science, environmental history, and coastal ecology. Stakeholders represented agencies at the state, county, and municipal level as well as local planning and partnership organizations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>We engaged more than 70 stakeholders in a scenario planning process to create (1) a set of community-based guidelines for what constitutes ?best practices? for sustainable coastal development and (2) a set of ?visions? for implementing the best practices along the south shore of Lake Superior and Marquette County in particular</strong>.</p>\n<p>Researchers from the Great Lakes region, local decision makers and dozens of stakeholders contributed to the workshop series and helped to develop the these guidelines, which can be used to inform future development and policy decisions.
