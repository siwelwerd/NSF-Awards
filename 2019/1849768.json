 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent technological advances have popularized cryptography, the art of making and breaking codes. This project will capitalize on the societal interest in cybersecurity and cryptography and explore how the skills that underlie the encrypting and decrypting practices in cryptography parallel the skills that children must develop to become successful readers and writers. Given the importance of cryptography and cybersecurity, the project will introduce a new technology-enhanced STEM education model for engaging children of 7-10 years old, particularly girls, in cryptography and cybersecurity building and STEM identity development as they make and break secret codes. The mystery of the subject, its relevance in today's society, and interactive learning experiences will engage children, and the after-school environment where the project will be performed will provide a safe space for them to learn at their own pace. The important scientific and educational outcomes will include improved understanding of how literacy, self-efficacy, computational thinking, 21st century skills, and interest in cryptography and cybersecurity can be fostered at the elementary school level.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this project is to conduct a systematic investigation of the effective conditions for designing and implementing touch-screen enhanced visuospatial learning curricula that foster STEM interest and career awareness using the unique context of cryptography. An interdisciplinary team of K-12 after-school teacher leaders, education technologists, special educators, computer scientists, and STEM education researchers will design a 6-week, 24-hour program of cryptography focused apps and activities for upper elementary students (grades 3-5) in after-school programs that serve primarily girls and African American students. To encourage adoption and facilitate dissemination, the Codebreakers curriculum will be available online in the form of an interactive, touch-friendly website. A mixed-method research design will employ a range of methods including phenomenology, comparative case studies, pretest-posttest analyses, and mixed-effects modeling. The project will use qualitative data to explore students' and teachers' perceptions and experiences with the Codebreakers activities and technology. Quantitative data will be used to make inferences regarding the quantifiable impacts of the strategy on the development of students' self-efficacy, interest and identity in STEM, evolution of their understanding of cryptography and cybersecurity, and the development of their morphological awareness. Ongoing professional development (PD) and support will be provided face-to-face during bi-weekly meetings with teacher leaders and using the Codebreakers online social network.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Yet the United States is currently experiencing a critical shortage of cybersecurity professionals. Even though the demand for the profession is high, there is a lack of interest in the profession at the colligate level. This is a problem so central to our national security, the White House issued a National Cybersecurity Strategy which outlines several strategic objectives to address this gap. One of the strategic objectives is to develop the cyber workforce by increasing cyber education and pathways (The White House, 2023b). The White House highlights the need to transform cyber education at the K-12 level, in part, through investing in educators (The White House, 2023a).</p>\n<p>This investment is critical as cybersecurity is not regularly taught in K-12 schools. This is, in part, because there are few K-12 and educator standards for learning cybersecurity, and therefore few opportunities for K-12, preservice teachers, and teachers for formal learning experience in this discipline (Authors, 2022a). This means K-12 teachers have little exposure to cybersecurity content (Javidi &amp; Sheybani, 2018).</p>\n<p>Our project is a collaboration between educational researchers, afterschool educators, computer scientists and engineers, and media artists to create, implement and disseminate a curriculum for engaging elementary-aged children in cryptology and cybersecurity. Our curriculum and all its activities, games, and resources are available for free use at <a href=\"http://www.cryptocomics.org\">www.cryptocomics.org</a>.</p>\n<p>CrptoComics is comprised of six modules and introduces young learners to cryptology, the art and science of making and breaking secret codes, (Paar &amp; Penzl, 2010) and cybersecurity as well as jobs within both disciplines. The 18-hour curriculum utilizes transmedia story telling (Jenkins, 2007) to tell an engaging and interactive story through multiple modalities. The curriculum is housed in an app which can be hosted on a web browser or as a tablet app and is comprised of three interrelated pieces: a digital comic book, digital games and puzzles, and unplugged games and puzzles (Figure 1). Learners join in the adventures of characters Akila, Bai, Carly, and Jabari as they go on a code breaking adventure through space and time (Figure 2). Educators guide learners through the comic book, digital and unplugged activities as learners make and break secret codes, learn about codes and symbols from different cultures throughout history, and meet role models who currently work in the fields of cryptology and cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>CryptoComics has shown promise in improving afterschool educators&rsquo; perception of and confidence with cybersecurity education (Antonenko et al., 2021, 2022; Dawson et al., 2022) and in increasing elementary students&rsquo; cyber security knowledge and career awareness (Wusylko et al., 2022;
