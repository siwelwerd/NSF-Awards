 "awd_abstract_narration": "White dwarf (WD) stars are the endpoint of stellar evolution for the vast majority of stars. As such, they are useful forensic probes for studying the end stages of the stellar life cycle. A white dwarf is a compact star that contains the mass of the Sun within a volume comparable to that of the Earth (about a million times smaller).  White dwarfs no longer undergo nuclear fusion like the Sun, but continue to glow from residual heat for billions of years.  A research group at Texas A&M University-Commerce will carry out a program to use data from the Gaia space mission combined with observations from ground-based telescopes to double the sample of known WDs in young open clusters, or groupings of a few thousand stars of about the same age.  These scientists will use this large sample of WDs to address several open questions in a range of astrophysical areas including: variability in total mass lost by stars during late stages of stellar evolution, the lower mass of the progenitors of supernovae, or stellar explosions, the evolution of close multiple star systems, and the fate of planetary systems.  This project will expand an existing successful effort to improve undergraduate student learning and retention in introductory STEM classes by providing funding to train and mentor undergraduate learning assistants for revised, learner-centered introductory astronomy courses.  The project will also offer first-generation college students and underrepresented students from depressed rural areas opportunities to participate in astronomy research.\r\n\r\nWhite dwarf stars in open star clusters are versatile and powerful forensic probes for studying the end stages of the stellar life cycle.  In particular, white dwarf studies allow us to constrain the total mass lost by stars during their post-main sequence evolution, the lower mass limit for core-collapse supernova progenitors, the formation rate of double degenerate systems, rotation rates of red giant cores and their coupling to the star's envelope, and white dwarf atmospheric and structural evolution.  White dwarfs in open star clusters are especially useful tools in large part because the many crucial stellar parameters are known, including total age (white dwarf cooling time plus progenitor lifetime) and metallicity.  The project builds on earlier studies of white dwarf stars in open clusters made by the investigators; parallax and proper motion data from the Gaia mission and multi-epoch deep imaging of open clusters virtually eliminates uncertainties in cluster membership, vastly reducing the number of inferences currently made in the published literature.  Through the use of national, state and local university facilities, the researchers expect to nearly double the number known open cluster white dwarfs and to be able to implement ensemble studies of white dwarf formation and evolution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWhite dwarfs are the remains of sun-like stars that have exhausted their nuclear fuel and thus completed their life cycle. Just as the study of biological remains can provide significant insight into the life and death of a creature long gone, the study of white dwarfs gives astronomers insight into processes of nuclear fusion and complicated physics that occurs during the final stages of a star's life.\r\n\n\n\nThe primary intellectual merit (scientific outcomes) of this completed project included:\r\n\n\n\n1) The first determination of the relationship between a helium-atmosphere white dwarf's mass and that of its progenitor star. Roughly 25% of white dwarfs have atmospheres dominated by helium instead of the more common hydrogen atmospheres. Our work finds that while most of these white dwarfs have masses similar to what we would expect given their parent star's mass, there are known exceptions that we cannot yet explain.\n2) A study of the white dwarfs in the old open star cluster Messier 67. This star cluster has a large number of white dwarfs, and our analysis of their properties suggests that there is little if any difference between the white dwarfs that originate from progenitor stars of similar mass, age, and composition. This result was expected but had not been conclusively shown before.\n3) Nearly half of all massive white dwarfs with strong magnetic fields rotate rapidly, with rotation periods less than about 6 hours. There are two competing explanations for this result. First, massive white dwarfs come from more massive stars, which are known to spin much more rapidly than sun-like stars. Second, massive white dwarfs may result from the merger of two normal mass white dwarfs; these white dwarfs would spiral in together, leaving a rapidly spinning single massive white dwarf behind. Our work also discovered two of the three fastest-spinning single white dwarfs - one spinning every 3 minutes, and the other spinning in less than 90 seconds.\n4) Several other projects were completed, though with more ambiguous results. These include a search for pulsating white dwarfs in the star cluster Messier 67, since white dwarf pulsations act as starquakes that let us explore the interior of the stars. Marginal weather for this work led to marginal and unconvincing results. We also attempted to prove that faint white dwarfs were definitely members of multiple star clusters by looking for similar motions across the sky; this worked well for white dwarfs in Messier 67, but for other star clusters the results were ambiguous due to the tiny motions of these faint objects. Finally, we have simultaneous spectroscopy and imaging of rapidly rotating white dwarfs in a very young star cluster that hint at changes in the stars' atmospheres as they rotate, but mediocre weather prevents definitive statements.\r\n\n\n\nThis project also provided funding for broader impacts beyond pure research. Funds were used to pay undergraduate students to be \"learning assistants\" in a large astronomy class for non-science majors. These learning assistants circulated throughout the classroom during group activities, helping student groups to understand tricky concepts. Fnal exams in classrooms with learning assistants had average grades of nearly 80%, while those in classrooms with the same instructor and activities but without learning assistants have final exam scores averaging around 67%.\r\n\n\n\nThis funding supported research by multiple undergraduates and graduate students, most of whom came from groups underrepresented among astronomers. Five master's student research theses and one PhD thesis resulted from this work; two of these students have gone on to PhD programs while the other four are working in science education and/or private technology companies. Results from student-led projects have been presented at two international conferences (pictures included) and multiple regional and state research symposia.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KurtisAWilliams\n"
