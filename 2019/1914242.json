 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research supported in this project will provide insights into how atomic nuclei and elementary particles and radiation behave in extreme conditions of temperature and density. The PI will leverage these insights to provide important clues about the nature of elementary particles, the mysterious neutrinos in particular, and about how the elements are synthesized in nature, e.g., the heaviest elements in the fiery interiors of collapsing stars or colliding neutron stars, and the lightest in the first seconds in the early universe.  In turn, these considerations can give us insight into new physics. The calculations to be done in this project will involve honing humanity's fundamental theory of nature, i.e., Quantum Mechanics, into a tool capable of modeling the behavior of neutrinos in the extreme environments provided by the cosmos. Another key product of this Project will be the training of young nuclear physicists, at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. \r\n\r\nThe research supported in this Project will be directed toward probing the fundamental physics of neutrinos and nuclei by exploiting the intersection of exciting new developments in nuclear physics and neutrino physics on the one hand, with the explosion of new data and insights from the advent of multi-messenger astronomy and precision cosmology on the other. A key issue in this enterprise will be studying how neutrinos interact in dense matter and how these interactions may cause neutrinos to change their flavors (e.g., electron type neutrinos changing to tau type and vice versa). This is a fiercely nonlinear problem because neutrino flavor/spin determines how neutrinos interact, and how they interact determines how flavors/spin change. To these ends, the P.I. and his graduate and undergraduate students will work toward: (1) Understanding and modeling the quantum kinetic equations which govern neutrino flavor and spin evolution in a general medium; (2) Constructing large-scale numerical simulations of neutrino flavor/spin evolution in the early universe and compact object environments and assessing the feedback of this neutrino flavor physics on the prospects for the synthesis of nuclei in these sites, and the implications of this physics for multi-messenger observations and dark sector physics; (3) Understanding nuclear structure, neutrino-nucleus interactions, nuclear partition functions, and nuclear weak strength distributions in high temperature environments.\r\n\r\nThis project advances the objectives of \"Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics\", one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
