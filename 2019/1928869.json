The purpose of PPEPPD is the sharing of state-of-the-art techniques to further product and process design that will fuel world-wide economic growth in the chemical and related industries, and allow us to model  new processes for achieving more efficient separations and meeting lower greenhouse gas emission goals. PPEPPD 2019 will bring together the most important international researchers in the application of molecular thermodynamics to industrially relevant product and process design. \r\n\r\nThe PPEPPD 2019 International Conference will provide an opportunity for exchange of ideas on the cutting edge of techniques for thermophysical properties and phase equilibrium measurement and estimation, and identify the challenges in the growing areas of alternative energy resources and storage, gas and oil upstream and downstream processing, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, marine and saline systems and processes, nanotechnology, and sustainability. American participation is essential for making contributions to the general knowledge base, for building awareness of global activities, and for fostering international collaborations.  The US-based researchers supported by this grant will have the opportunity to interact with academic and industrial researchers from around the world and exchange ideas on the latest advances on molecular thermodynamics research and education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this grant was to cover the cost of travel of U.S. academic participants in need of support to attend the 2019 international conference on Properties and Phase Equilibria for Product and Process Design (PPEPPD) that was held on May 12-16, 2019, on the campus of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.  This conference was the fifteenth conference in the series.  One of the primary goals of PPEPPD is to provide interaction between academics, government researchers and industrial representatives worldwide on how molecular thermodynamics (experimental and computation) can benefit real world industrial product and process design.  There is full agreement that this series of conferences is unique in providing the highly desirable interactions between these groups to meet this goal.  The meetings are the most important gatherings for molecular thermodynamicists from all over the world.  \n\nThe meeting in Vancouver consisted of the Prausnitz Award Lecture, a Young Research Award Lecture (new for this conference), 14 invited lectures, 26 other oral presentations, 136 poster presentations, and two workshops (All About Data and Thermodynamics Undergraduate, Graduate and Continuing Education).   More than 150 delegates came from North America, South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.  The conference venue provided excellent opportunities for both formal and informal professional interactions.  \n\nThe grant provided airfare for four faculty speakers and one faculty member of the International Organizing Committee (three of the five of whom are female) to attend the 2019 international conference on Properties and Phase Equilibria for Product and Process Design (PPEPPD) that was held on May 12-16, 2019, on the campus of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.  Funds were also used to support 14 early career (graduate students, post-docs and assistant professors) researchers.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/04/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joan F Brennecke"
