 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project was awarded through the \"Special Guidelines for Submitting Collaborative Proposals under the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems, the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation, and the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems - the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (ENG-EPSRC) Lead Agency Activity\" opportunity. The maximum speed at which a liquid can spread stably over a solid surface is the key factor to determining the outcomes of numerous natural and technological processes.  The instability that emerges when this maximum speed of dynamic wetting is exceeded creates complex three-dimensional flows that are typically undesirable.  For example, undesirable air bubbles can be entrained into the liquid while applying a coating, severely limiting the rate of manufacture of a wide range of products.  Improved understanding of this instability is essential for developing strategies to increase the maximum speed of dynamic wetting, which will benefit many practical applications.  This project uses a combination of experimental analysis and computational modelling to significantly advance fundamental understanding of the complex three-dimensional flows that arise when the maximum speed of dynamic wetting is exceeded.  User-friendly software will be developed that others can apply to understand numerous other problems involving dynamic wetting that arise in areas such as climate science.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, in collaboration with researchers at the University of Warwick,  will make significant progress in resolving longstanding issues in the area of dynamic wetting by (i) development of a user-friendly multiscale computational framework capable of capturing 3D phenomena, (ii) use of both analysis and computational modelling to characterize and understand the stability of dynamic wetting lines, and (iii) use of both computational capabilities and experimental investigations to characterize and understand interfacial instabilities governing the dynamics of droplets.  The key advance of the computational modeling will be the development of a dynamic mesh generation capability for finite-element methods that can accurately resolve three-dimensional time-dependent flows.  The experiments will be conducted in a custom-made coating apparatus, and will involve measurements of the maximum speed of dynamic wetting and instability wavelength by flow visualization, as well as measurements of the thickness of entrained air films by interferometry.  The knowledge generated from this project is expected to stimulate new directions of fundamental research and to benefit numerous natural and technological processes in which dynamic wetting plays a key role.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe spreading of a liquid over a solid surface plays a key role in numerous natural and technological processes, such as the movement of raindrops on inclined substrates and the high-speed deposition of liquid coatings. Spreading is an example of dynamic wetting, the displacement of some fluid (for example, air) initially in contact with a solid surface by a liquid that advances over the surface. Despite the ubiquity and importance of dynamic wetting, there are still numerous unresolved fundamental questions about the underlying physical mechanisms. This is largely due to transitions in the shape of the fluid-fluid interfaces as dynamic wetting proceeds, some of which are extremely complex due to their three-dimensional nature. This lack of fundamental understanding presents an obstacle to improving technological processes in which dynamic wetting plays a key role. The work supported by this grant has significantly advanced fundamental understanding of several aspects of dynamic wetting. First, we have used mathematical models to much more extensively characterize transitions in high-speed dynamic wetting relative to previous work. The results suggest novel strategies for designing faster coating processes through the application of temperature gradients and suction or injection of air. Second, we have used mathematical models to rationalize previously unexplained experimental observations regarding the movement of droplets in the presence of a surrounding fluid flow. Third, we have used mathematical models to understand how three-dimensional topographical features on a solid substrate influence droplet motion. These results provide a foundation for engineering surfaces and fluid flows to control droplet dynamics, which is relevant to applications such as water harvesting from fog, droplet-based microfluidic devices, and inkjet printing.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/22/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SatishKumar\n"
