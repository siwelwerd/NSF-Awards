 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to make advances in hypersonic flight, nuclear fusion, ballistic impact protection, and concentrated solar power, materials are needed that can withstand temperatures far above the melting point of typical high performance materials.  This project investigates the effects of composition and microstructure on the properties of complex transition metal boride ceramics which have melting temperatures above 3000 C and are among the highest melting points for any known materials.  This class of materials is known as ultra-high temperature ceramics.  Entropy stabilization, a concept whereby at least four other elements in approximately equal ratios are added to a binary compound, has been used to produce stable, high entropy borides. Initial studies using this approach focused on synthesis and densification without analyzing properties.  Hence, this research addresses a gap in knowledge of fundamental composition-microstructure-property relationships for boride ceramics.  The scientific outcomes of the project will include identification of relationships among processing conditions, microstructures, and properties to enable design selection of compositions and microstructures that will yield properties desired for demanding applications.  The broader impacts will include increased inter-campus collaboration between a doctoral university with higher research activity and a public university that offers terminal M.S. degrees. This collaboration will include expanding distance methods to extend curricular offerings at both schools, and establishing stronger research links between both to enhance student recruitment and increase access to research infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe research will use an integrated experimental and computational approach to provide an unprecedented level of knowledge about the atomic structure, microstructure development, and composition-microstructure-property relationships for boride ceramics containing multiple transition metals.  The main goals of the project are to:  1) utilize the entropy stabilization effect to produce new boride compositions containing metals that do not typically form borides; 2) control microstructure development by manipulating densification kinetics through changes in composition; and 3) establish ultra-high temperature structure-property relationships in this emerging class of materials.  Computational methods will be used to investigate solution formation behavior, thermodynamic properties, and defect formation energies. Complementary experimental studies will focus on processing and properties of entropy stabilized boride ceramics.  Reactive hot pressing will be used to produce ceramics with controlled compositions ranging from highly pure borides with containing one transition metal to entropy-stabilized compositions containing five transition metals in roughly equal proportions.  In addition, reactive hot pressing offers the ability to control microstructure development to enable studies of microstructure-property relationships.  The project will utilize advanced characterization tools to quantify metal distributions in boride ceramics with complex compositions, which will help elucidate densification kinetics, and measure intrinsic mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of high entropy boride compositions.  This project will lead to unprecedented knowledge of the thermochemical stability and inherent properties of entropy stabilized ceramics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project supported research and professional development activities for three graduate students and two post-doctoral scholars.\nAs of November 28, 2022, the project resulted in six published papers, one accepted for publication, two M.S. theses, and one Ph.D. dissertation.\nResults from the project were presented in 17 invited and 11 contributed presentations at international technical conferences or seminars at universities and research institutes. \nStudents, post-docs, and faculty involved in the project have participated in a variety of outreach activities that introduce K-12 students to opportunities for education and careers in the area of materials science and engineering.\nIn Year one, a process for synthesizing and densifying (Hf,Nb,Ta,Ti,Zr)B2 ceramics was devised.  The process uses a combination of boro/carbothermal reduction and spark plasma sintering.  The process is general and was used throughout the project to produce borides of many different transition metal borides.\nInitial nanoindentation measurements found that the elastic modulus was 546 GPa and hardness was 33.1 GPa.  Further studies will determine the dependence of modulus and hardness on crystallographic direction.\nInteratomic potentials designed to model ZrB2 phase have been devised and validated compared to experimental property values.\nKey electronic structures and transport properties were calculated as a first step toward elucidating the effects of solid solution additives on material properties such as thermal conductivity.\nDensification of nominally pure ZrB2 was studied and kinetic parameters were determined as a baseline for future studies of densification behavior of high entropy borides\nThe solubility of Y was studied in borides and found that Y was not dissolved into single component or more complex borides.\nInteratomic potentials for pure ZrB2 and high entropy borides were developed and validated.\nCalculations of thermal properties were extended from nominally pure borides to solid solution diborides containing two transition metals.  This establishes an approach that can now be extended to more complex high entropy borides.\nThe intrinsic thermal expansion and the anisotropy in thermal expansion both vary with the composition of high entropy borides;\nBorides can form homogeneous solid solutions in which the average lattice parameter varies linearly with the size and amount of each constituent transition metal, but the first-nearest-neighbor bond distances are set by the size of the specific transition metal on the lattice site;\nGrain-scale chemical composition fluctuations was characterized through analysis of a combination of high-resolution synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction and energy dispersive spectroscopy, which showed that larger lattice microstrain values indicated higher levels of chemical inhomogeneity.\nNew analytical interatomic potentials were developed for zirconium diboride to improve accuracy of prediction of thermal expansion coefficient and heat capacity\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William G Fahrenholtz"
