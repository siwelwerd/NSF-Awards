 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate fracture of liquid crystal elastomers under a single or multiple cycles of loading. A liquid crystal elastomer is an elastomer with liquid crystal molecules on a polymer network aligning in a certain direction. Liquid crystal elastomers find broad applications in stimuli-responsive actuators and soft robotics. Therefore, understanding their fracture behavior and preventing their failure have practical significance. Studying nonlinear fracture mechanics of liquid crystal elastomers, which involves coupling between stretching of polymer networks and reorientation of liquid crystal molecules, is also fundamentally unique and important. This project has broader impacts in education and technology. The research work will be included into a new graduate class, integrated into research projects for graduate and undergraduate students, and developed into demonstrations for K-12 outreach activities. In addition, understanding fracture of liquid crystal elastomers will have long-term impacts in the fields of stimuli-responsive actuators and soft robotics by preventing failure of liquid crystal elastomers during operation and designing durable liquid crystal elastomers for reliable devices.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to establish a nonlinear fracture mechanics theory for liquid crystal elastomers, and experimentally characterize their fracture and fatigue processes and properties. This project will use both simulations and experiments to determine the crack-tip fields, energy release rates, and fracture energies of liquid crystal elastomers under a single or multiple cycles of loading. A viscoelastic field theory of liquid crystal elastomers coupling the fields of stress and liquid crystal orientation, along with the cohesive zone model will be established and used to computationally calculate the time-dependent crack-tip fields and energy release rates, to simulate crack propagation, and to determine the fracture energies of polydomain and monodomain liquid crystal elastomers. Experimentally, mode I and mode III fracture energies of liquid crystal elastomers will be measured by the pure shear and trousers tests, and the crack-tip fields will be observed using digital image correlation and transmission circular polariscopy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As one of the most important stimuli-responsive soft materials, a LCE is an elastomer with liquid crystal mesogens on the polymer network aligning in certain direction, called the director. Mechanical stresses can re-orient the director of LCEs, inducing a large spontaneous strain. Studying the nonlinear fracture mechanics of LCEs coupling stress and director fields has both fundamental and practical significance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to accurately capture the fracture processes of LCEs, we first studied their viscoelastic constitutive behavior. Experimentally, we prepared monodomain main-chain LCEs using a two-stage thiol&ndash;acrylate reaction, and conducted uniaxial stress-strain tests at different loading rates. We probed the director reorientation during stretching by transmission circular polariscopy, and the shear strain due to director rotation by digital imaging correlation. As a result, the director rotates towards the stretching direction when an applied stress is not along the initial director, producing a stress plateau (Fig.1). We show that all the stress, shear strain and director are highly rate-dependent (Fig.1). Under a higher strain rate, the stress is higher, and the director rotation is delayed, which leads to less obvious soft elastic behavior. We also conducted relaxation tests, and conclude that the characteristic relaxation time of the network extension is much larger than that of the director rotation. Furthermore, a constitutive model was developed to manifest the complex relation between rate-dependent macroscopic deformation and microscopic director rotation in LCEs. While existing viscoelastic models of LCEs do not capture their typical stress-softening behavior well, we proposed a viscoelastic field theory to resolve this problem by introducing a deformation-dependent semi-soft free energy. Using this model, we can not only predict the rate-sensitive dependence of the homogeneous stress, shear stretch, and director on the normal stretch quantitatively well (Fig.1), but also capture highly inhomogeneous deformations (Fig.2).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, we combine theory and experiments to unravel how the strong stress-director coupling in a monodomain LCE induces its unique crack-tip fields. Our results reveal that the directors undergo significant and inhomogeneous rotation at the crack tips (Fig.3), leading to very different stress/strain distributions of LCEs from traditional elastomers. Particularly, when the initial director is tilted to the loading direction, the stress/strain distributions are asymmetrical about the crack plane. Notably, we discover a domain wall forms along a certain polar angle at the crack tip, with opposite director rotation, and thereby shear strain, on the two sides of the domain wall. Moreover, LCEs with a tilted initial director to the loading exhibit much smaller crack openings and energy release rate than those of neo-Hookean materials, while LCEs with a parallel director exhibit higher values (Fig.3). We attribute these findings to a combined effect of bulk softening in the remote region and the formation of domains of opposite director rotation near the crack tip. We also conducted relaxation and creep tests to edge-cracked LCE samples, and observed non-monotonic stress changes at the crack tips with the holding time attributed to the delayed director rotation and network extension (Fig.3). The consequent time-dependent energy release rate can lead to delayed fracture of LCEs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We further experimentally and computationally studied crack propagation in viscoelastic LCEs. We conducted tensile tests on edge-cracked LCEs with different initial directors and geometry under different loading rates (Fig.4, 5). Our findings reveal that the cracks always propagate almost horizontally in the deformed configuration, and therefore, the fracture paths deviate from the pre-crack when the sample is fully relaxed if the initial director is tilted (Fig.4). The crack angle decreases as the stretching rate increases, while the critical fracture strain exhibits a non-monotonic dependence. The entire fracture path is also highly influenced by the stretching rate. Moreover, the crack angle non-monotonically increases and then decreases as the angle of the initial director increases. To gain insights into the fracture behavior and criteria of LCEs, we developed a viscoelastic phase-field fracture model, which is validated by experiments and shows great predictive capabilities for LCE fracture (Fig.4, 5).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project well demonstrates the cross-discipline of mechanics and materials, providing training and mentoring opportunities to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students through research and teaching. The PI has trained 6 graduate students and 5 REU undergraduate students, including two underrepresented and female students, to work on this project. The PI also mentored three underrepresented freshmen for a research project as a part of their engineering introduction class (Fig.6).
