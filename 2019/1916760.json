 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Hardware and Embedded Systems Security and Trust (CHEST) coordinates university-based research with needs of industry and government partners to advance knowledge of security, assurance, and trust for electronic hardware and embedded systems. Interests of CHEST include identification, detection, monitoring, mitigation, and elimination of vulnerabilities that affect hardware and embedded systems. The CHEST Center addresses a range of attack vectors across design, operation, manufacturing, supply chains, and integration of the hardware, software, and firmware to a variety of systems. The Center is inventing and disseminating technologies, practices, and guidelines to stakeholders and educating a next generation of experts.\r\n\r\nThe NSF CHEST Center addresses security, assurance, and trust across several levels: Large-scale systems, embedded systems, design, operations, requirements, standards, manufacturing, supply chains, and integrated circuits and boards. Among the CHEST universities, the University of Virginia (UVA) leads in identifying testbeds for improving security and trust at the level of integrated systems. UVA develops methodology for systemic risk, resilience, reliability, logistics, data analytics, and systems engineering. Research topics include (i) resource allocation and priorities of large-scale systems; (ii) tracking emergent and future conditions of supply chains; and (iii) aggregating trust and security of devices to quantification of system resilience.\r\n\r\nSecurity, assurance, and trust of integrated cyber-physical systems enable meeting fundamental human needs, along with supporting broader social, environmental, and economic progress of the nation. The ability of systems to absorb disruptive shocks and recover with minimal loss is key to protecting human lives and property. The NSF CHEST Center influences the practices of industry, government, and the military in design, protection, and resilience to vulnerabilities associated with hardware and embedded systems. Improving assurance and trust contributes to reducing the frequencies and severities of adverse events with attention to system missions, performance, schedule, and cost.\r\n\r\nThe NSF CHEST Center website, www.nsfchest.org, provides the repository for all publicly accessible data, code, results, etc. These pages will be maintained for at least as long as the CHEST Center is active. In addition, all CHEST Center projects that are led by UVA are permanently archived in digital format on the UVA file servers with sufficient provisions for backup and recovery in case of equipment failure. All archival UVA computers and servers are backed up on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
