 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is in support of a Sustainable Urban Systems (SUS) workshop. While food waste has been studied in the scientific literature, primarily from the technical perspective, much of the existing research is fragmented across single disciplines and disconnected case studies. Modeling, managing, assessing, and replicating sustainable urban food waste solutions will require novel research approaches, organized under the principle of convergence, which deeply integrates knowledge and methods from different disciplines, and carried out through meaningful collaborations between scientific researchers and stakeholders embedded in the food supply chain. This SUS workshop is targeted to catalyze these collaborations, provide a platform of exchanging knowledge across fields, and establish a sustainable urban systems research agenda organized around the specific and compelling problem of minimizing and managing food waste for broad social, economic, and environmental benefit. A key aspect is the planned approach to capturing geographic heterogeneity in urban food waste systems and solutions, by structuring the workshop scope to consider both aggregate impact of multiple urban areas in a single state and comparative analysis of cities across the U.S. \r\n\r\nEfficient, resilient, and robust food supply chains are a critical part of sustainable urban systems. Knowledge created by convergent research networks can inform design of resource-efficient technologies, policies, and social interventions to minimize food waste and attendant energy, water, and resource use in cities and the peri-urban and rural regions on which they rely. Research catalyzed by this workshop is expected to generate new models of multi-scale transboundary interactions and innovative solutions for urban food waste challenges. These findings have potential for broad social, economic, and environmental benefit, and will be broadly disseminated to both scientific and stakeholder audiences. The workshop is anticipated to lead to greater understanding of how SUS science can be communicated effectively to help individuals, communities, and businesses take action to reduce their contribution to food waste. The workshop will also provide attendees with new understanding and approaches to engage traditionally underrepresented groups, particularly deaf/hard of hearing learners and scientists, in research leading to discovery and innovation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The workshop was organized around the specific problem of sustaining the urban food system by minimizing and managing food waste for broad social, economic, and environmental benefit. The workshop engaged 47 participants from across the United States from academic disciplines including science, engineering, economics, business, policy, social science, education, public health, computer science, architecture, and design. Participants also represented non-profit, consulting, business, government, non-governmental organizations, entrepreneurial, and education sectors.

Our workshop demonstrated how new collaborations across academic disciplines and knowledge co-created with food system stakeholders can lead to a compelling, creative, and novel research vision. Bringing this vision to bear on the challenge of sustainable urban food systems will require fundamental research advances on all facets of food loss and waste (Babbitt 2019): from experimental analysis and 'proof of concept' for novel technologies to models of how these solutions overcome cultural, political, and technical barriers for widespread deployment; from economic and environmental benefit-cost analyses for a single urban case study to a generalizable decision model drawing from U.S.-wide urban cross-comparisons; and from lessons learned in historical analyses of sustainable interventions to future-oriented scenarios of complex, interacting urban agents and infrastructure that will give rise to a sustainable urban food system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/21/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Callie&nbsp;W&nbsp;Babbitt</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1929881/1929881_10603340_1600660345088_BK2Q5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1929881/1929881_10603340_1600660345088_BK2Q5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Workshop Wordcloud\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1929881/1929881_10603340_1600660345088_BK2Q5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop Wordcloud\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Thematic analysis of workshop discussions and findings, highlighting most common terms used.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jessica Oehman</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Callie&nbsp;W&nbsp;Babbitt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Workshop Wordcloud</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1929881/1929881_10603340_1600660625793_Workshop_galleria--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1929881/1929881_10603340_1600660625793_Workshop_galleria--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Workshop Session\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1929881/1929881_10603340_1600660625793_Workshop_galleria--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop Session\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Workshop participants discuss novel hydroponics technology as a pathway to increased food access and decreased food waste.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Melissa Hall</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Callie&nbsp;W&nbsp;Babbitt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Workshop Session</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
