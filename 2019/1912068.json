 "awd_abstract_narration": "This theoretical research program concerns the quantum mechanical properties of atoms in the ultracold low temperature regime.  Each atom possesses internal states.  In addition, the atom moves like a point particle and hence can be characterized by such quantities as momentum and angular momentum.  In the ultracold regime the interplay between the atomic internal degrees of freedom, and their external motion, as well as interactions between different atoms, leads to many intriguing phenomena which this research project aims to investigate.  On the one hand, such studies can deepen our knowledge about the fundamental properties of atoms --- the basic building blocks of matter; on the other hand, the research results could shed light on the mysteries of superfluids and superconductors which may have future societal impact.\r\n\r\nThis research program can be divided into two projects.  In the first project, the researchers will focus on the properties of a coherent mixture of two different atomic gases.  Due to the presence of the inter-species interaction, the properties of such a mixture can be quite different from those of an individual gas.  For example, certain properties of the pure gas may be significantly modified in the mixture, and new and exotic quantum phases that do not exist in a pure gas may emerge in the mixture.  Furthermore, the inter-species interaction also offers a new control knob to manipulate the atomic system which may open up new avenues of research.  In the second project, the researchers will consider ultracold atoms confined into one dimensional space.  Such a system has been routinely realized in the laboratories by trapping atoms in elongated geometries.  Such confinement can greatly affect the quantum properties of the atom. The researchers will develop new theoretical tools to help us better understand the novel properties of ultracold atoms in one dimension, particularly in the strong interaction limit where conventional methods often fail.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
