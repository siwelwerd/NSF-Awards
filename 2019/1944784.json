 "awd_abstract_narration": "Open Science has the potential to significantly advance STEM knowledge beyond individual academic research silos. This project will support a conference entitled, \"Examining Impact and Fostering Academic Support for Open Science Products.\" The meeting is jointly organized by the American Educational Research Association (AERA) and the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS).  The objective of the conference is to examine the products of open science practices and explore what counts as productivity and quality in contributions that are non-traditional research outcomes. Non-research outcomes have attendant activities that include data sharing; the development of multi-user data sets, harvesting and archiving big data, replication studies, registered reports, data management plans, and use as well as citation to persistent identifiers (DOIs).\r\n\r\nThe conference attendees are higher education leaders, education researchers, and related scientists, together with collective expertise in scientific productivity, science professions, higher education institutions.  The conference will engage attendees in a policy conversation and development of performance metrics and assessments on non-traditional research outcomes beyond publication citations in highly ranked journals. This several-day conference, scheduled for Summer 2020, will be held at the AERA Conference Center in Washington DC and will involve about 28 participants. This conference has the potential to support change and foster experimentation in the very institutions where the next generation of researchers are being trained, where science is organized, and where open science products are produced.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program. The NRT Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
