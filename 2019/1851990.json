In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Science Directorate, participants work on addressing some of society's important biochemical, energy, and environmental problems at a major research university using top facilities and instrumentation. The participants' research experiences are supplemented with extensive hands-on training and mentoring. All participants deliver presentations on their summer research, participate in an end-of-summer research symposium, and have an opportunity to present their work at a national chemistry meeting. Professional development is fostered by a visit to a local industrial or government laboratory and by weekly joint luncheons for all fellows with topics on ethics, effective oral and written communication, and career opportunities. To increase the program's impact and sense of community among the participants, undergraduate students are encouraged to volunteer for an outreach program that gives children the opportunity to perform hands-on chemistry experiments at local community libraries.\r\n\r\nThe individual research projects encompass a wide range of chemical research, including multimetallic catalysts for small-molecule activation and functionalization, modeling structure and reactivity in molecular systems, studying protein-protein interactions, and synthesis and self-assembly of renewable resource block polymers. This program's recruitment effort places an emphasis on attracting underrepresented minority and economically disadvantaged students and encouraging participants to consider careers in chemistry-related fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
