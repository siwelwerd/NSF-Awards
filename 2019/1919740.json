 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project supports the acquisition of a state-of-the-art vibration measurement system to enable fundamental research and education in engineering and biology.  The instrumentation will enable researchers to develop a fundamental understanding of how vibrations propagate in complex environments, leading to enhanced man-machine interfaces, more efficient renewable energy sources and new ultrasound-based therapeutic strategies. The instrumentation will catalyze interdisciplinary research collaborations among thirty faculty, staff and students and with industrial partners. The instrumentation will be integrated into coursework and labs and will enhance outreach activities for K-12 students and underrepresented minorities.\r\n \r\n \r\nThese investigations will support the development of models for vibration propagation through complex systems and the development of technologies that use vibrations in novel ways.  The projects will acquire high-resolution, non-contact, full-field data on structures that span size, scale, and material properties: from microscopic to larger amplitude, from short to long range, from low to high frequencies, and through varying mediums. These data will enable researchers to develop better models to understand (1) ultrasonic vibrations as it relates to surface haptic technologies; (2) vibrational communication in insects and arachnids; (3) insights into physical interactions between ultrasound and porous structures for bone healing; and (4) new designs for nature-inspired wind turbine blades.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
