 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide new cost-effective and efficient polymers for air and water purification to minimize the risk of infections caused by bacteria and other pathogens. The technology has the potential to improve or replace traditional methods for air purification in established heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems without modifications of existing equipment. While hospitals heavily rely on high-efficiency particulate air filters to fulfill their need for bacteria-free air, the required air handlers consume a significant energy, are expensive, and often cost-prohibitive for some facilities. The platform technology developed here potentially addresses these drawbacks and also accommodates a wide range of other potential applications, such as manufacturing of protective fabrics, and paints, as part of cosmetics and bandages, or as coatings of medical devices and implants without the need for specialized equipment for the end-user. The platform facilitates the integration into existing manufacturing processes and gives access to various market segments at minimal upfront investment.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project further develops a platform for antimicrobial microgels with initial applications centering on air purification. The cross-linked polyacrylates contain immobilized transition metal complexes. The material is synthesized using UV-light initiated radical polymerization of miniemulsions at ambient temperature or below. The miniemulsions are obtained by ultra-sheering of monomer mixtures in aqueous solutions in presence of appropriate hydrophobes and ionic surfactants. The resulting suspensions show high antimicrobial activity towards Gram-positive and -negative bacteria that result from a synergy of material properties. Extended shelf-life stability and activity of the material have been demonstrated, the activity of the polymer suspensions in Petri-dish assays have been documented, and proof-of-concept data for material activity when mounted on paper have been obtained.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We learned and practiced in the initial 7 weeks methods to conduct customer discovery interviews and continued thereafter to a total of 150+ interviews in the fitness and air filter industry and their key stakeholders. From listening to owners of small fitness boutiques and managers of upscale gyms and health clubs, we learned that there is a strong need for high air quality in indoor facilities that is not met with current and expensive technologies, such as HEPA filters or UV-based air purifiers. Continued customer discovery during the pandemic until August 2021 included anticipated key partners in the air filter industry, such as manufacturers and distributors. The interviews revealed that the need for high quality air filters has increased by 1000% over the pandemic. We also learned that the general public is now sensitized to pathogens in the air in commonly shared facilities such as hospitals, universities, child-care facilities, and other work places, and residences. We additionally learned that the ASHRAE standards for air exchange flow in rooms as well as the recommendations for air filter qualities have been adjusted and increased from MERV 8 to 13. The extensive product-market fit data gathered through the I-CORPS program over the past 24 months allowed us to submit a PRF-TT proposal for further development of the technology and to found Savera Technologies LLC. We plan to commercialize our technology in the air filter industry and will apply for funding for our start-up through a proposal to the SBIR/STTR mechanism in near future.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/15/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Susanne&nbsp;Striegler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
