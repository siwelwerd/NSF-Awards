 "awd_abstract_narration": "In contrast to large metropolitan areas that have resources to prepare for sea level rise, there are many small underserved coastal communities that do not have the resources to design and implement engineering solutions to address the challenges caused by sea level rise. In this project, the expertise of community members will be linked with the expertise of undergraduate engineering students to create a framework to help a small community develop plans for adapting to sea level rise. The research team and students will interact with members of the community through various community engagement techniques. The resulting generalizable model has the potential to improve community involvement in the design process for building more resilient coastal communities. Additionally, the framework will support the design of plans at a significantly reduced financial cost, which will further promote sustainability in the community. This community-driven design framework will provide undergraduate engineering students experience designing real-world projects with societal benefit. This project will also demonstrate the value of linking university expertise and community engineering needs. \r\n\r\nThis project will link the knowledge embedded in rural coastal communities with the engineering expertise of undergraduate students to design solutions that build resilience and bolster the participation of marginalized communities in adaptation planning. Through the interdisciplinary efforts of engineers and social scientists, the objectives of this work are: (1) develop a framework where the research team engages community members and engineering students to advance a community-based design process focused on generating solutions to issues caused by sea level rise; (2) document local community members' perceptions of the contributions of the framework to resiliency; and (3) assess how community interaction affects engineering student outcomes. This framework will involve citizens to identify the critical problems and determine how to best address community needs. The research team will hold small focus groups to foster detailed discussions with knowledgeable stakeholders, conduct frequent meetings with a core stakeholder group that represents the many interests in the community, and host quarterly public meetings to keep the broader community informed and gather additional feedback. The involvement of engineering students and community engagement techniques to advance engineering design will result in a low-cost approach for resource-limited coastal communities that will promote community resilience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
