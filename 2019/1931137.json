 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is in partial support of the Symposium on Industrial Ecology for Young Professionals, organized by the International Society for Industrial Ecology Student Chapter Board (ISIE-SCB) under the mentorship of an NSF CAREER Awardee from the CBET Environmental Sustainability program. The symposium focuses on transition of industrial ecology (IE) research into tangible outcomes through policy development or implementation. The main goal of this symposium is to provide an opportunity for young professionals who perform research in IE to use their research skills to identify and develop ways to translate environmental engineering and sustainability research concepts into actionable items, visit industrial facilities in the locale of the symposium site that have implemented innovative IE concepts, discuss their novel research ideas and experiences, and receive constructive feedback. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThe symposium will advance participants' fundamental skills in research and grant writing, oral presentation, developing effective research products, and increasing the impact of their research. The symposium will also provide students and young researchers with the skills to connect their research interests to policy relevant questions. Additionally, the symposium will provide an opportunity to facilitate initiation of international collaborations among young professionals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The ISIE 2019 Conference, themed &nbsp;&ldquo;Industrial Ecology for Eco-Civilization,&rdquo; brought together researchers, industrial practitioners, and policymakers to discuss how their research skills could be applied towards the development of more sustainable societies. In line with this subject, the ISIE Student Chapter Board hosted the SIEYP VI with the theme of &ldquo; Turning research into action&rdquo;. During the associated SIEYP VI, young professionals including graduate students, postdocs, researchers, assistant professors, and other junior faculty members developed their skills of translating research ideas into policy initiatives, visited innovative industrial facilities in Beijing, discussed their original research ideas and experiences, and received constructive feedback. By attending both SIEYP VI and ISIE 2019 conference, they also examined their ideas with experts in the field of industrial ecology, as well as established relationships with international peers and professionals for collaborations in their future research.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The SIEYP VI focused on translating industrial ecology research into tangible outcomes through policy development or implementation. The main goal of this symposium was to provide an ideal venue for young professionals who perform research in the industrial ecology to use their skills to identify and develop methods to translate environmental science and sustainability concepts into actionable items.</p>\n<p>The main outcomes achieved during the SIEYP VI include two parts. First, the &ldquo;Industrial Ecology Peer Groups (<a href=\"https://is4ie.org/sections/students/pages/38\">https://is4ie.org/sections/students/pages/38</a>)&rdquo; has been launched. Based on 60 student peer group sign-ups and their research interests survey conducted during the symposium, 16 sub-groups were set up to explore different research topics relevant to industrial ecology, such as policy, circular economy, diversity and inclusion, blockchain, information and communication technology(ICT). These groups enabled a strong network of students to get informed, speak up, and connect with industrial ecology peers in between the ISIE biennial conferences. Students researching similar topics, drawing upon similar methods and tools would reach out to one another directly, share resources and progress on research as well as discuss topics more casually through the ISIE forum (a part of the ISIE website). The peer group also encouraged students to take a leadership role in each of the sub-groups as a coordinator. It was another excellent way for students to organize group activities with sufficient free space and lead their industrial ecology peers.</p>\n<p>Second,&nbsp; the &ldquo;Virtual Networking&rdquo; events were hosted regularly, about four times a year. Using pre-arranged Skype conversations, it was similar to striking up brief and interesting conversations at a conference cocktail hour. About six researchers were matched with each other in each group based on their interests and hours of availability. The skype calls were scheduled for 15 minutes, with 5-minute breaks in between. Themes for discussion include open science, circular economy, sustainable resource use, waste management, metabolism, sustainable urban systems, food-energy-water nexus, air pollution. This event connected fellow students and post-docs who were engaged in important and interesting research around the globe, especially under the COVID-19 circumstances. Also, participants took this chance to strengthen their bond in the industrial ecology community. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>SIEYP VI and its spin-off events build long&#8208;lasting international relationships and collaboration between young professionals in industrial ecology. These collaborations may bring broad benefits to U.S. science and society.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/07/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Matthew&nbsp;J&nbsp;Eckelman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931137/1931137_10604834_1602068168850_SIEYPimage1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931137/1931137_10604834_1602068168850_SIEYPimage1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SIEYP conference warm-up\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931137/1931137_10604834_1602068168850_SIEYPimage1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SIEYP conference warm-up\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants talking to each other in the warming-up activities</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zhengyang Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matthew&nbsp;J&nbsp;Eckelman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SIEYP conference warm-up</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931137/1931137_10604834_1602068253659_SIEYPimage2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931137/1931137_10604834_1602068253659_SIEYPimage2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SIEYP field trip\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931137/1931137_10604834_1602068253659_SIEYPimage2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SIEYP field trip\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Field trip to the Smart Agriculture Exhibition Center in Beijing</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zhengyang Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matthew&nbsp;J&nbsp;Eckelman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SIEYP field trip</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931137/1931137_10604834_1602068334065_SIEYPimage4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931137/1931137_10604834_1602068334065_SIEYPimage4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SIEYP field trip\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931137/1931137_10604834_1602068334065_SIEYPimage4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SIEYP field trip\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Field trip to China International Battery, Raw Material, Producing Equipment and Battery Parts Fair</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zhengyang Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matthew&nbsp;J&nbsp;Eckelman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SIEYP field trip</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931137/1931137_10604834_1602068431616_SIEYPimage5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931137/1931137_10604834_1602068431616_SIEYPimage5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Student poster presentations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931137/1931137_10604834_1602068431616_SIEYPimage5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Student poster presentations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student poster presentations during International Society for Industrial Ecology 2019 conference</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zhengyang Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matthew&nbsp;J&nbsp;Eckelman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Student poster presentations</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931137/1931137_10604834_1602068558997_SIEYPimage6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931137/1931137_10604834_1602068558997_SIEYPimage6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SIEYP student awards\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1931137/1931137_10604834_1602068558997_SIEYPimage6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SIEYP student awards\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student awards ceremony at the International Society for Industrial Ecology 2019 conference</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zhengyang Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matthew&nbsp;J&nbsp;Eckelman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SIEYP student awards</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
