 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop, to take place Spring 2020, brings together the scientific community, data facilities and computer specialists to develop practices for building a lasting legacy for all data from the GeoPRISMS program. As part of the NSF-funded GeoPRISMS decadal program, researchers have collected and generated diverse, shoreline-crossing data sets, from the field, lab, and numerical models. The data sets cover a remarkably wide range of data types reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the GeoPRISMS community and the many funded projects. The broader impacts of the workshop include the promotion of data and information sharing and a publically available report on the workshop outcomes. The workshop will support early-career attendees as well as those from under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nA number of GeoPRISMS data sets already reside in NSF-approved repositories. Although some data sets are well-positioned, there are questions and challenges that must be addressed to ensure a lasting, robust, well-documented and easily accessible legacy for all GeoPRISMS data. The benefits of preserving and making accessible all of these GeoPRISMS data sets include supporting scientific reproducibility, enabling the re-use of data, including for unanticipated purposes, and facilitating new science through convenient access to aggregations of data. In addition, storing the data in community-recognized repositories promotes the principles of FAIR data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable), complies with NSF data management requirements, and serves the data access demands of some journal publishers. The agenda and goals will be refined by a GeoPRISMS-sponsored mini-workshop on the same topic at the 2019 AGU Fall Meeting. The recommendations resulting from this 2.5-day workshop will promote convenient public access to and long-term preservation of all GeoPRISMS-funded data sets to secure a lasting data legacy for the program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
