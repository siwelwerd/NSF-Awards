 "awd_abstract_narration": "The resilience of a network is generally defined as its ability to continue performing well when it is subject to failures \r\nand attacks. Designing and developing graph analysis algorithms that are robust against missing data, incomplete network \r\nobservation, or errors in data collection is essential in many real-world applications. One fundamental and important class \r\nof graph analysis methods are those that find the dense regions in a given network.  These methods have applications in \r\nbioinformatics, social network analysis, router network monitoring, visualization, and other areas. Core decomposition, \r\na powerful and efficient algorithm for finding dense subgraphs, has been proven to be extremely useful in understanding \r\nthe structure of complex networks from a variety of domain. However, it is notoriously non-robust against small changes in the network structure. This project will explore and characterize the robustness of core decomposition process and develop attack (and corresponding defense) \r\nstrategies to manipulate the network to hinder the core decomposition analysis. The outcome of this research will allow \r\nfor increased understanding of the accuracy core decomposition analyses on real-world networks, and propose new, related \r\ndecompositions that are more robust against noise or missing data.\r\n\r\nThe project will be performed in three parts: 1) Exploring and characterizing the robustness of core decomposition to develop a variety of techniques and metrics to quantify the robustness, 2) Developing graph modification 'attack' strategies to tamper with a network's core structure by \r\nadding/deleting nodes or edges -- the project considers three types of attacks: those targeting nodes' core numbers, the subgraphs \r\ninduced by the core decomposition, and the hierarchy induced by the core decomposition, 3) Developing corresponding strategies\r\n to defend against the attacks on a network's core structure. Given the wide application space of core decomposition, this project\r\n will increase the robustness of algorithms for describing the hierarchical structure of a network, detecting central nodes,\r\n spotting the anomalies, and speeding up algorithms for other tasks, like community detection.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe purpose of this project was to (1) explore and characterize the robustness of the k-cores on real-world networks, (2) develop attack strategies that insert or delete nodes or edges in order to hinder the k-core-related analysis of a network, and (3) develop defenses against such attacks. A k-core is a substructure of a network or graph that gives insight into its overall connectedness, and has use in a number of applications, such as graph visualization and finding influential nodes. As such, understanding the robustness of such a structure is useful in understanding the robustness of the network as a whole. There have been a number of major lines of work within this project:\r\n\n\nFirst, we studied the resilience of network k-core structures to missing network data. As part of this, we developed techniques to identify the nodes and edges that are most important to the k-cores structure, and provided a method for characterizing the robustness of the k-core as a whole. Using these techniques, we presented the ResidualCoreMaximization (RCM) algorithm for solving the so-called Anchored k-core Problem, in which the goal is to find which nodes should be preserved in order to maximize the size of the networks k-core. Across real-world networks, we demonstrate that RCM results in anchored k-cores that are on average 1.65 times larger than those produced by the next best baseline, and is approximately 500 times faster than the next best baseline.\r\n\n\nBased on this resilience work, to introduce techniques for gaining further insight into k-core resilience, we introduced the notion of the core skeleton of a graph- a minimal set of edges that preserves the core numbers of all nodes. This led to a fruitful line of research on sampling skeletal k-cores uniformly at random, using their properties to quickly estimate properties of the graph as a whole, and better characterizing network robustness.\r\n\n\nIn a separate line of work, we examined causes and properties of network strata (densely connected tiered groups). We explored the existence of such strata in scientific collaboration networks, finding that when a scientific field is young, such strata are mostly absent, but within a few decades, strata clearly emerge. This represents reduced collaboration across the network. We additionally proposed an agent-based model for explaining the origins of such strata. \r\n\n\nWithin the network science community, k-cores have been of great interest.
