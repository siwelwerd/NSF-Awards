 "awd_abstract_narration": "This awards supports research in gravitational wave detector instrumentation, and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's \"Windows on the Universe\" Big Idea. Since its initial gravitational-wave discovery in 2015 the NSF's Advanced LIGO has observed numerous black hole and neutron star collisions, shedding new light on a broad set of questions in astrophysics, cosmology, fundamental physics, and nuclear physics. The observatories' sensitivity can be improved further by controlling thermal distortion effects when operating at high laser power, and by lowering the thermal noise in its test mass mirror coatings. This award funds research into better laser wave front distortion sensors and actuators, and supports collaborative research into finding better coating materials for terrestrial gravitational-wave detectors. Both research directions pursue the common goal of significantly expanding the observational reach of Advanced LIGO. The award provides students and postdocs access to a world-class observatory and prepares them for scientific leadership positions.\r\n\r\nThe award specifically provides funding for: (i.) The development mode-converter-based optical wave front sensors, capable of simultaneously sensing cavity alignment and mode-match for the Advanced LIGO detector. (ii.) The development of a phase camera, based on pixel-demodulation, to provide high-resolution RF beat maps of the laser field in the detector at a high frame rate. The camera is intended for use in interferometer commissioning and feedback control. (iii.) Exploring options for sensing and control of higher-order wave front aberrations. (iv.) Continued commissioning support in collaboration with LIGO Laboratory to improve the astrophysical sensitivity and bandwidth of Advanced LIGO in the upcoming O3 and O4 observing runs. (v.) Installation support for the construction and testing of a cryogenic nodal suspension for measuring mechanical loss of new coatings down to cryogenic temperatures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
