 "awd_abstract_narration": "The presence or absence of water on a small Solar System object tells us much about the object's history and helps us trace the evolution of the Solar System. Bodies closer to the Sun than the main asteroid belt are too warm to retain liquid water, while bodies further than, approximately, Jupiter's orbit are beyond the \"snow line,\" where surface water is permanently frozen. Two groups of asteroids, just inside Jupiter's orbit (known as the Cybeles and Hildas after the largest member of each group) are proposed for study here. The PI will use telescopes to break down visible and infrared (IR) light into its constituent colors. From this, she will search for absorption features diagnostic of minerals that contain liquid water. The PI will involve undergraduate students from the College of Charleston in the research; part of the requested funding will be used to purchase a new small telescope for the undergraduate-only institution. This telescope will be used in the research. She will also visit astronomy and earth sciences classes at a local high school, where she has established a collaboration, in the Charleston area.\r\n\r\nThe team will obtain visible (0.4-0.8 micron) spectra and near/mid-infrared (0.7-4.2 micron) spectra for 23 Cybeles and 9 Hildas). This broad wavelength coverage will allow them to constrain the shallow 0.7-micron hydrated mineral band, the 0.9- and 1.1-micron bands due to water-rich clay minerals, the deep and sharp 3.0-micron hydrated mineral band, the rounded 3.0-micron water ice band. For the brightest 13 targets, they will obtain rotationally resolved 0.7-micron spectra. The observations will require ~25 nights spread over 7 observing semesters for both the sub-meter optical telescope on campus and NASA's InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project involved multiple student researchers obtainingand analyzing visible and near-infrared spectra of Hilda and Cybele asteroids (relatively far from the Sun) in order to help determine their surface composition and, specifically, to search for and quantify the amount of water on their surfaces. These asteroids are in a cold part of the solar system that has a higher chance of preserving water, and they may also be a match to the objects that bombarded Earth early in its history, delivering its water oceans. One of our project goals was to investigate a link between these types of asteroids and those ocean-giving small bodies that were crucial to the development of life on Earth.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe initially planned on obtaining the visible spectra using an instrument mounted on the College of Charleston 24-inch telescope  an instrument commissioned for this project and intended to be left as a legacy product for high-quality student and outreach usage. We were able to successfully commission the instrument, but the global COVID pandemic prevented the hired students from using it to obtain the project data. Our solution was to use competitive time won on the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) remotely operated telescope network to obtain the visible spectra. Our infrared observations were obtained through time won on the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDespite severe obstacles posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic, weather losses, and observing requests not awarded, we were able to obtain viable visible spectra for 3 Hildas and 7 Cybeles. Visible results show a wide variety of spectral slopes, even if the same object was observed multiple times, suggesting that the surfaces of Cybeles are very diverse, perhaps exhibiting patches of differing composition even on the same object, further complicating interpretation of data. Four of the 7 Cybeles observed also showed water-altered minerals on their surfaces, a higher fraction of objects compared to previous studies, suggesting that water is more common on the surfaces of Cybeles than previously thought. The 3 Hildas with visible spectra also showed diverse spectral slopes, and one of them also had hydrated mineral features, with properties similar to water-rich CM2 chondrite meteorites. However, the sample size was too small to draw further conclusions.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nOur infrared spectra covered 0.7-4.0 microns, a challenging region to observe from the ground, but one containing many useful compositional indicators. None of these spectra showed a 0.7-micron absorption feature from hydrated minerals, but one object showed an incredibly deep 3-micron absorption band similar to the dwarf planet Ceres. The depth of this feature is comparable to those seen on the colder, transient Centaur objects and likely comes from its abundance on this particular asteroid, indicating a perhaps anomalously water-rich asteroid within the Main belt or possibly a common origin to Centaurs. Due to the small sample size and lack of follow-up data as of yet, we cannot conclude more about this object, its origin, or the likelihood that nearby objects with similar properties also show incredibly deep 3-micron bands. However, we did request follow-up observations through the James Webb Space Telescope Cycle 4 program, in hopes of answering those questions. A summary paper is currently being written, to include involvement from the many students that worked on this project.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SarahSonnett\n"
