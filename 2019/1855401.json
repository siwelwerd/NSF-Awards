 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 2016, the National Science Foundation (NSF) unveiled a set of 'Big Ideas,' 10 bold, long-term research and process ideas that identify areas for future investment at the frontiers of science and engineering. The Big Ideas represent unique opportunities to position our Nation at the cutting edge of global science and engineering leadership by bringing together diverse disciplinary perspectives to support convergence research. This proposal responds to that vision and describes an Ideas Lab on 'Synthetic and Artificial Cells.' Ideas Labs are intensive workshops focused on finding innovative solutions to grand challenge problems. The ultimate aim of this Ideas Lab is to facilitate the generation and execution of innovative research projects aimed at designing, fabricating, and validating synthetic cells. \r\n\r\nThe ability to design and manufacture synthetic cells has significant implications for the scientific and economic enterprise of the United States. The synthesis of viable cells from non-living molecules and materials can open the door to the production of functional biomaterials and improved biofuels, large scale chemical synthesis, non-silicon-based computing, novel soil engineering, and medical and pharmaceutical advances, to name just a few possibilities. The study of synthetic cells, and of the processes used in their creation, can also provide a window on the origin and evolution of life on Earth and, potentially, provide insight into extraterrestrial life. The aspiration is that mixing researchers who have diverse scientific backgrounds will engender original thinking and innovative approaches that will transform our understanding of cellular processes, the molecular mechanisms that underscore the building and function of systems that reproduce life traits, the self-assembly of life-like systems, soft condensed matter, and the physics and chemistry of life that are needed to design and build cellular components, cells and multicell systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe cell is where inanimate chemicals turn into life.  Although we know a lot about how cells work, we still do not know how cells first arose, nor do we really know what are the most essential elements of a cell that make it alive.  The attempt to build synthetic or artificial cells represents nothing less than the attempt to create life, an aspirational goal of humanity for centuries.  Pursuing this goal is important because it will focus research on the truly essential mechanisms of life, help drive new basic research, and potentially form the basis for a new area of engineering based on custom-built living systems. \n\n \n\nDespite the potential impact of creating synthetic cells, the effort has been stymied by the fact that many different types of expertise are needed to build a cell.  Biologists are needed to provide an understanding of how actual cells work, but also chemists and chemical engineers to provide approaches for building cell-like structures from chemical building blocks.  Computer scientists and engineers are needed to provide insights into control and regulation.  The possibility of creating life also creates numerous concerns about accidental release, as well as ethical questions surrounding life creation, hence there is the need for input from experts in ethical, legal, and social implications.  These varied fields typically do not interact.  The major outcome of the Synthetic Cells IDEA lab was to bring together experts from all of these fields, allowing them to jointly conceive ideas for new research projects dedicated to the longer term of goal of creating and exploiting synthetic cells.  During the course of the event, attendees had the chance to exchange ideas and jointly come up with bold new plans to make synthetic cells with new capabilities, for both engineering applications and for basic research purposes.  This outcomehas the intellectual merit of launching new research directions at the interface between fields, and the broader impact merit of catalyzing new discussion and thought about the classic question of what is life.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wallace Marshall"
