 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for US participation in the conference that will be held during the entire month of March 2019, at the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques(CRM) in Montreal, Canada.  The conference focuses on recent developments in Free Probability Theory, which is deeply related to topics in several areas of Analysis, including Operator Algebras and Random Matrices, and also to other areas of mathematics such as Combinatorics.  Free Probability was created in the 1980s by Dan Voiculescu.  His fundamental insight was to treat phenomenon in operator algebras related to free groups in a noncommutative probabilistic framework, with his notion of freeness taking the place of independence. Free Probability Theory has developed extensively; the parallels with usual probability theory are quite far reaching.  This has led to fundamental insights and far reaching developments in diverse areas, including Operator Algebras and Random Matrices.  The program at CRM includes two workshops, one on theoretical aspects and another on applied aspects of Free Probability.\r\n    \r\nA number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.  The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.  More information is available at: http://www.crm.math.ca/crm50/en/march-1-31-2019-new-developments-in-free-probability-and-applications/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The theory began 35 years ago with Voiculescu's discovery of the free central limit theorem and free independence.  Since those beginnings, free probability theory has grown into a mature theory with important connections with von Neumann algebras, harmonic analysis, random matrices, combinatorics and problems in quantum information theory, wireless communications and mathematical physics.  The continuing discovery of many deep analogues with classical probability has been a source of amazement to the practitioners of the subject, and even to the experts of the theory.\n\nThe program at the CRM brought together researchers leading the new developments in free probability and it applications.  The program included two intensive week-long workshops and overlapped with the Aisenstadt Lectures, which were delivered by Alice Guionnet and were thematically related to the topics of the program.  The workshops were entitled \"Free Probability, the theory, its extensions\" and \"Free Probability, the applied perspective.\"  Mathematicians were present and discussions and collaborations and talks were ongoing throughout the duration of the program.\n\nThe number of participans supported was 22, including 10 graduate students, 7 postdoctoral researchers, and 5 assistant professors.  11 of these were speakers either during the workshops or as part of the activities that were held during the weeks when there were no workshops.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/04/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth J Dykema"
