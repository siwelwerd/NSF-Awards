 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Catalysis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Professors Shouquan Huo and Yumin Li at East Carolina University developing catalytic reactions that convert a carbon-hydrogen bond into a carbon-carbon bond.  By exchanging these bonds, subsequent reactions can produce more complex molecules that can be used as building blocks in drug discovery and materials science. Drs. Huo and Li are working with undergraduate and master's-level students to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanisms by using both laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations. Dr. Huo expands his innovative 1-2-3 Undergraduate Research Enhancement Program to attract more students to research and to train them more effectively. This project is broadening the participation of students from underrepresented groups and engaging high school students through collaboration with the East Carolina University Summer Ventures in Science and Mathematics (SVSM) Program. The project is also preparing students for a stronger national scientific workforce and contributing to educational, economic, and societal development in the eastern Carolina region.\r\n\r\nDrs. Huo and Li are studying a unique platinum-catalyzed carbon-hydrogen (C-H) acylation reaction and advancing this underdeveloped reaction into a practical synthetic method. Compared to other metal-catalyzed C-H acylation reactions, this platinum-catalyzed reaction is free of oxidants and other additives, and also free of undesired decarbonylative side reactions. As such, efficient methods to introduce alhpa-, beta-, and gamma-keto ester functional groups, diketone groups, and various other acyl groups into a variety of aryl-heteroaryl ethers, are being studied, thereby creating many biologically and/or medicinally interesting building blocks. Drs. Huo and Li are also investigating the mechanism of this platinum-catalyzed reaction using a combined experimental and computational approach. Experimental studies are unveiling the underlying factors controlling the reactivity and selectivity of the reaction while density functional theory (DFT) and the nudged elastic band (NEB) methods are being used to locate the lowest energy pathway of the reaction and predict the structures and stabilities of key intermediates and transition states. DFT is also being employed in the design of new catalysts. This research is advancing fundamental knowledge in organometallic chemistry while providing efficient methods to a broad organic chemistry community. Further, undergraduate students, master's-level graduate students, and high school students are engaged in the synthesis and characterization of organic and organometallic compounds, computational modeling, data analysis, and dissemination of research results.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The method is based on the platinum-catalyzed ortho C-H acylation of 2-aryloxypyridines. Unlike other transition metal catalyzed C-H acylation methods, the platinum-catalyzed C-H acylation of 2-aryloxypyridines does not require any oxidants or any other additives. The reaction proceeds with an excellent control of selectivity. Only ortho C-H bonds of substituted 2-phenoxypyridine substrates can be acylated. For meta-substituted 2-phenoxypyridine substrates, the acylation only occurs at the less sterically hindered ortho position. Double acylation can occur with the parent 2-phenoxypyridine and its para-substituted derivatives. The reaction is generally favored by the electron-donating substituents at the phenyl ring. The ortho-substituted derivatives of 2-phenoxypyridine displayed significantly higher reactivity towards the C-H acylation reaction than other substrates. In particular, their reactions with ethyl chlorooxoacetate are essentially substituent-independent and could accommodate both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups such CN and NO<sub>2</sub> groups. Acylating reagents displayed very different reactivity with decreasing order of reactivity for ethyl chlorooxoacetate, 2-(dialkylamino)-2-oxoacetyl chloride, chloroacetates (very slow reaction), and dimethylcarbamyl chloride (no reaction), which reflects the relative electrophilicity of these reagents.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The mechanism of the platinum-catalyzed C-H acylation reaction has been understood through experimental and theoretical studies. Multiple competing reaction pathways in the platinum-catalyzed C-H acylation of 2-aryloxypyridines have been identified through experimental studies, which were caused by the isomerization of the initial platinum catalyst cis-Pt(PhCN)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and the platinum complex intermediates formed afterwards (Figure 2). The investigation has also explained the higher catalyst activity of cis-Pt(PhCN)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>than that of trans-Pt(PhCN)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. The minimum energy pathway for the acylation of the cycloplatinated 2-phenoxypyridine derivative, a key step in the catalytic C-H acylation reaction, has been identified through a theoretical study using density functional theory (DFT) and nudged elastic band (NEB) theory (Figure 3). The NEB simulations suggest that the acylation proceeds through (1) nucleophilic substitution at acetyl chloride by the platinum to form a five-coordinate acylplatinum species, (2) 1,2-acyl migration from the platinum to the cyclometalated carbon through a three-membered platinacycle transition state to give a Pt-arene &eta;<sup>2</sup>-complex, which is the rate-determining step, (3) ligand exchange with chloride to form a neutral Pt-arene &eta;2-complex, and (4) further ligand substitution to release the product.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;alpha-Keto esters and amides are important functional organic compounds, not only frequently appear in natural products or biologically and/or medicinally interesting molecules but also serve as the precursors to other important functional molecules and have a great potential in organic synthesis. 2-Aryloxypyridines are also found in biologically active molecules such as herbicides and pesticides. The results from this project provide additional tools for drug discovery and the development of pharmaceutical and environmental products. This project marks an important advancement in the platinum chemistry in terms of its synthetic application as the use of platinum in catalysis is much less developed than its counterparts nickel and palladium.
