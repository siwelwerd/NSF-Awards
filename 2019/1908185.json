 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Late-Stage Design and Development collaborative effort submitted to the teaching strand of the Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK12) Program. This project will address the pressing national need to generate shared, practice-based knowledge about how to implement freely available, high-quality instructional resources (mathematics formative assessment lessons) that have been shown to produce significant gains in student learning outcomes. It will expand a professional development model (Analyzing Instruction in Mathematics using the Teaching for Robust Understanding Framework (AIM-TRU)) that supports teacher learning about effective lesson implementation. The backbone of AIM-TRU is a growing, open repository of video cases available to teachers and teacher educators across the U.S. who use or are interested in using the lessons. The repository will include tools such as a facilitator's guide to support teachers and teacher educators to engage in the model and collaboratively investigate the video cases. Consequently, the work will have the potential to engage teachers and teacher educators in improving mathematics education at scale. Because the video cases will capture implementation and ideas for improving instruction in schools serving populations who are underrepresented in mathematics, AIM-TRU will serve to improve mathematics education equitably.\r\n\r\nResearch questions focus on what teachers learn about high-quality mathematics instruction and instructional materials within a community of practice, and how that learning influences their teaching. In AIM-TRU, teachers engage in the collaborative investigation of video cases utilizing a shared repertoire that includes questioning protocols adapted from the Teaching for Robust Understanding (TRU) framework. This framework articulates five dimensions of classroom instruction that are necessary and sufficient to support students in becoming powerful mathematical thinkers. This affords teachers opportunities to use the TRU dimensions as lenses to diagnose common problems of practice that arise in implementation, and propose innovations and theories for improving instruction that can be tested in real classrooms and documented in new video cases. Analytic tools will be used from frame analysis to produce empirical evidence of what teachers are learning about instruction and instructional materials along the five dimensions of TRU. These data will be mapped to a random sample of video recordings of participating teachers' instruction, scored using the TRU Math Rubric, in order to link learning outcomes from the professional development to changes in instruction. Addressing these research questions will provide a deeper understanding and empirical evidence of learning within teacher collectives, the pressing national need to develop mechanisms to produce collective professional knowledge for teaching, and further efforts to understand the types of knowledge required for effective teaching.\r\n\r\nThe DRK-12 Program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project built on Wenger&rsquo;s (1998) theory that learning occurs within communities of practice (CoPs), and in our project, the Professional Learning Community (PLC) structure common in educational environments provided the setting for robust teacher learning. To this end, the project developed a professional learning cycle called&nbsp;Analyzing Instruction in Mathematics using the Teaching for Robust Understanding Framework (AIM-TRU) that supports teacher learning about the implementation of high-quality lessons (https://www.map.mathshell.org/) through structured conversation centered on the mathematics of the lesson, the classroom implementation of the lesson, and video excerpts of students engaged in productive struggle around the tasks (shown in Figure 1). The centerpiece of the project outcomes is a repository of video cases that are freely available to teachers and teacher educators at https://tle.soe.umich.edu/aim-tru. The video cases, as part of the professional learning cycle, have the potential to support the growth of pre- and in-service teachers and teacher educators by fostering conversations that deepen content and pedagogical knowledge. Given the goal of leveraging mathematically rich student conversations  for teacher learning, AIM-TRU includes foci on (a) unpacking a lesson&rsquo;s  big mathematical ideas (BMI), (b) making observations about video cases  demonstrating students&rsquo; mathematical thinking, and (c) sets of video  case reflective discussion questions based on TRU (shown in Figure 3)  and utilizing the TRU On-targets (shown in Figure 2). In reflective  discussions, the teacher participants are prompted to both posit  possible teacher moves or questions that would support students in the  video case to engage with the mathematics based on a particular  dimension of TRU, and to align possible teacher moves to the big  mathematical ideas of the lesson featured in the video case. You can visit our resource page to find everything you need to use AIM-TRU in your context. Resources include our library of video cases (shown in Figure 6), within which you will find the video itself, a link to the associated Formative Assessment Lesson, information about the mathematical context, supplementary information about the school and lesson, a transcript of the video, and remote versions of lesson resources (if available). These materials are all adaptable to fit your needs. We have also created facilitation guides, slide decks, and orientation materials for teachers or teacher educators who would like to utilize the video cases for professional development or in teacher education courses. We encourage users to familiarize themselves with the materials and adapt the model to fit within their learning goals and circumstances.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the greatest possibility for broader impact is the ability of AIM-TRU to serve as a model for professional learning and PD facilitation in other content areas. Since a version of the TRU framework has been created for other disciplines, similar models for video-case based professional learning could be developed to analyze instruction in other disciplines. In addition, the Teaching for Robust Understanding dimensions (Schoenfeld, 2014) that describe characteristics of powerful classroom learning environments (shown in Figure 4) have a parallel version designed to support professional learning facilitation named Five Dimensions of Powerful Sites for Professional Growth (shown in Figure 5). We see this as the next level of our work as we build capacity for powerful facilitation of teacher learning.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we also see the TRU framework and On-target images as a vison that broadly describes and characterizes instructional environments in ways that prime teachers for thinking and discussing current content-specific classroom strategies including: (1) unit-based Big Mathematical Ideas of Amplify Desmos and Illustrative Mathematics curricula; (2) Productive Struggle as described and exemplified in the work of Jon SanGiovanni, et al.; and (3) the approach to engaging more students in thinking about mathematics through the Building Thinking Classrooms structures (Liljedahl, 2019).
