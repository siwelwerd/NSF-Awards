 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum information science aims to radically revolutionize technologies in communication, computing, and sensing. However, to achieve this goal, new materials and devices that utilize the unique properties of quantum mechanics need to be explored and seamlessly integrated on a common platform.  In this project, the investigators will exploit the novel properties of extremely thin quantum materials and use light to create precise quantum states to encode, transmit, and detect information and to demonstrate proof-of-concept quantum circuits. The goal is to demonstrate the generation, manipulation, transmission, and detection of quantum mechanical states of a system via precisely engineered materials on an integrated platform. If successful, this will enable the next generation of quantum circuits that may drive quantum computers in the future. The interdisciplinary nature of the research program will provide an excellent educational opportunity for training graduate and undergraduate students and prepare them for a future dominated by quantum technologies.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will exploit the valley polarization properties of layered 2D quantum materials and their heterostructures coupled to optical cavities to create precise quantum superposition states to encode, manipulate, transmit, and detect information in strongly coupled exciton-polaritons to demonstrate proof-of-concept quantum circuits. The strongly-coupled valley degree of freedom-based polaritons when escaping the system will produce photons with polarization reflecting the internal quantum state of the system, which will then be further manipulated and routed on-chip to different ports through routers designed via quantum symmetry paradigms. The team will utilize the properties of quantum materials with engineered quantum symmetries to assemble photodetectors that are sensitive to the polarization state of the photons from the coherent valley superposition states for on-chip detection. The interdisciplinary project will involve the exploration of emerging quantum and topological materials and their heterogeneous integration with integrated photonics technology to enable the next generation of quantum photonic circuits.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
