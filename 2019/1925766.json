 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Computing group at the University of Colorado Boulder provides a hybrid cloud infrastructure to support computing, data, and science gateway needs that are currently not met by the existing high-performance and high-throughput computing infrastructure. The system is also integrated into the Open Science Grid (OSG) to enable full utilization of the deployed on-premise hardware using otherwise idle compute capacity. The hybrid cloud system provides one integrated system view of the on-premise and public cloud to researchers so they can select the right resource to support their work. This new capability eases the burden of finding appropriate computational tools for their work, allowing researchers to focus on new discoveries and the advancement of their fields. Major emphasis areas of the research supported are in the geosciences, hydrological modeling, natural language processing, machine learning, and earth analytics. Members of the Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium (RMACC) have access to 20% of the provided cloud resources with a focus on smaller institutions.\r\n\r\nThis hybrid cloud provides: virtual machines either from a library or customized by the researcher; execution and orchestration of containers; serverless computing; and hosting for persistent science gateways and other science services. This project heavily leverages the NSF award #1659425 \"CC* Cyber Team: Creating a Community of Regional Data and Workflow Cyberinfrastructure Facilitators\" by reusing training materials on containerization and capitalizing on relationships established during focus groups and one-on-one consults.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The hybrid cloud system, named CUmulus, was based on the OpenStack platform for the on-premises deployment and integrated with Amazon Web Services (AWS).

All unused compute cycles are delivered to the OSG. Twenty percent of the cloud capacity is available for external Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium (RMACC) member usage. \n\n\nThis project has introduced options to researchers who have a variety of computational needs, supporting users from Applied Mathematics to Information Science to Biology.  These researchers previously had workflows that were not conducive to a scheduler but were able to find computational support through the hybrid cloud, which provides options for long-running environments.  CUmulus also provides a sandbox to users who want to test out workflows in a low-risk, low-cost environment prior to moving workflows to the public cloud.  In addition, integration of the on-premises portion of CUmulus with CU\u2019s supercomputers and large-scale data storage platform will continue to provide opportunities for researchers to deploy hybrid workflows to resolve complex computational research issues.  This infrastructure remains supported by the CU Boulder Research Computing group. \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/02/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shelley L Knuth"
