 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Murray State University (MSU) ADVANCE Adaptation project, will improve equity for STEM faculty at MSU, which is a regional comprehensive and primarily undergraduate public university in rural western Kentucky. MSU serves a region that has been historically underserved in STEM education.  The MSU Adaptation project will adapt programs from the University of New Hampshire (UNH), University of Washington (UW), and Jackson State University (JSU).  MSU LEARN will adapt UNH's interactive theatre program to reduce implicit bias on search, tenure and promotion committees. MSU GROW will address retention and leadership development by adapting JSU's writing retreats and UW's faculty workshops and continuing Murray State's peer mentoring circles. MSU LIVE will address work/life balance by creating a President's Work-Life Task Force, educating the MSU community about existing policies, and creating/revising policies regarding workplace flexibility and spousal accommodation. \r\n\r\nThis project builds on a successful ADVANCE Catalyst award by continuing the Mentoring Circle program and continue annual data collection.  This Adaptation project will also complement and contribute to MSU's long-term Strategic Initiatives Plan to recruit, retain and engage a diverse faculty.  MSU-LEARN will contribute to hiring of diverse candidates and removing bias from tenure and promotion processes; MSU-GROW will provide professional development and mentoring opportunities for both early-career and mid-career faculty; and MSU-LIVE will make MSU a family-friendlier workplace.  The project is designed to ultimately benefit all faculty at MSU.  Finally, this project has the potential to inform all institutions of higher education in Kentucky through a diversity plan required to be reported to the state Council on Postsecondary Education. \r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.  ADVANCE \"Adaptation\" awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based strategies to academic, non-profit institution of higher education as well as non-academic, non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
