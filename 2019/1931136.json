 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides travel support for undergraduate student participation in the Symposium on Undergraduate Research. This Symposium will be held at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society Division of Laser Science (DLS), in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Optical Society of America. The conference program includes many of the research topics central to Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in laser science acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology. \r\n\r\nThe meeting is scheduled to be held Washington DC on September 16, 2019. It offers an opportunity for undergraduate students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international community. Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US universities).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
