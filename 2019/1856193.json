 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation award provides support for the next three events in a conference series at Temple University that brings together around one hundred graduate students at all levels from a variety of backgrounds and universities, along with four distinguished plenary speakers that work at the interface of algebra, geometry, and topology. The 2019 conference will occur on June 1-2. The next two will be held on similar dates in 2020 and 2021. The conference provides an opportunity for a large number of young mathematicians with similar research interests to come together and develop mathematical relationships. The conference strongly supports interactions between graduate students and plenary speakers in formal and informal settings. This gives graduate students the chance to make connections with mathematicians outside of their respective universities and fields of study. Both speakers and participants are selected with attention to recruitment from under-represented groups in the field.\r\n\r\nThese conferences include a wide range of topics coming from Geometric Topology, Geometric Group Theory, Representation Theory, Homotopy Theory and Noncommutative Algebra.  Talks given by distinguished plenary speakers provide insights into how different parts of algebra, geometry, and topology are connected, present open research questions of interest, and describe recent techniques used in groundbreaking work in these fields. Moreover, the organizing committee is driven by the participation of Temple graduate students with faculty support and guidance, providing the students with several professional development opportunities. The conference website is at https://math.temple.edu/events/conferences/gscagt/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
