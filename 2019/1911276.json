 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer chip manufacturing is the foundation for mobile computing, cloud computing, fifth generation (5G) cellular network technology, artificial intelligence and other applications. Manufacturing computing chips now demands the capability that can place materials on substrates with unprecedented precision in composition, spatial location and dimensions. However, development of such manufacturing capability is still in early stages and demands new enabling knowledge. This award supports fundamental research to generate knowledge for the development of atomic-scale additive manufacturing. This new process enables a scalable method of manufacturing material systems with atomic precise control. Such material systems could also lead to new opportunities such as new catalysts for environmentally-friendly manufacturing and pollution control. The results from this research lead to production of useful, high performance materials and new knowledge to accelerate the development of a novel chip manufacturing process, thus promoting the progress of science and helping the U.S. sustain its leading role in advanced manufacturing. This research is cross-disciplinary and trains students in skills in manufacturing, vacuum technology, surface chemistry, materials science and analytical chemistry. The project involves engaging students, especially, women and underrepresented minorities in research, thus improving engineering education. \r\n\r\nArea-selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a key enabling technology to reduce functional device dimensions, reduce manufacturing complexity and cost for integrated circuits and reduce the energy consumption by computing chips. However, the potential of this technology is severely limited by the narrow choices of selective growth chemistries, as well as poor understanding of the heterogeneity of surface chemistry on the selectivity of nucleation in ALD. This research aims at establishing selectively-chemisorbed carboxylate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as inhibitors to block or inhibit nucleation during ALD. This research fills the knowledge gap of the inhibition mechanisms and the gradual loss of the inhibitor's ability in blocking nucleation during ALD, and eventually leads to new strategies to improve the inhibitor in blocking nucleation. The collaborative team achieves these goals by studying the formation of carboxylates and selectivity of the nucleation of ALD chemistries with in situ characterizations of the substrate's mass and chemistry, and gaseous byproducts, and with ex situ atomic force microscope-infrared (AFM-IR) spectroscopy to exam the heterogeneity of surface chemistries and establish the relationship of chemistry-process parameter-nucleation inhibition.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
