The talks will range from the more classical model theory of valued fields to the pure and geometric side of the model theory spectrum. There will also be talks presenting applications of model theory of valued fields, e.g. to non-archimedean geometry and motivic integration. This award provides an opportunity for US based early stage researchers and Ph.D students to learn from the world-leading experts and to actively engage in research on these recent developments.\r\nMore details are available at the conference website https://ivv5hpp.uni-muenster.de/u/fjahn_01/mtvfa/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
