 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on several problems in computational commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. This project is concerned with the study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables. Polynomial equations model many real world phenomena, ranging from robotics motion planning to physics to conservation programs. To each system of polynomial equations, we associate a set of points, called a variety, which correspond to the set of solutions for all the equations. There is a growing body of literature that shows that the computational complexity of the system of polynomial equations has deep connections to the geometry of the associated variety. In nice cases, when the associated variety is smooth, there are well understood bounds limiting the computational complexity. In the worst possible cases, complexity is doubly exponential. Recent work of the PI shows there is a middle ground which is still poorly understood. The goal of this research is to better understand this connection.\r\n\r\nThe research aims to attack several open questions concerning projective bounds on syzygies. One goal is to study Rees-Like Algebras, which were essential in the PI's construction of counterexamples to the Eisenbud-Goto Conjecture (joint with I. Peeva), and to relate their properties to the more well-studied Rees Algebras. A second goal is to provide effective bounds on invariants, such as the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity or the degrees of individual syzygies, in terms of other invariants. All of the projects have a computational flavor and include writing code for Macaulay2, an NSF-sponsored computer algebra system maintained by Grayson and Stillman. \r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe original aim of this grant was to study graded syzygies of ideals in a polynomial ring, with special attention to Rees-like algebras, which were important in disproving the long-standing Eisenbud-Goto Conjecture.  Through a series of two papers, the PI, Mantero, and Miller made substantial progress in understanding the singularities, canonical modules, Picard groups, and singular loci of Rees-like algebras.  These were published in Mathematische Zeitschrift and Michigan Mathematical Journal, respectively.    In recent work, the PI showed that the best replacement bound for regularity of a prime ideal in the Eisenbud-Goto conjecture must grow at least doubly exponentially in the degree of the prime ideal.  This sharpened previous bounds that were merely super-polynomial.  Proving the Eisenbud-Goto Conjecture with additional hypotheses remains an outstanding problem.\n\nSecondarily, the PI made progress on several outstanding problems on syzygies of quadratic and Koszul algebras.  In joint work with Seceleanu, the PI constructed quadratic Gorenstein algebras with linear syzygies for arbitrarily many steps before a non-linear one, showing that there is no 'finite check' for the Koszul property even in the context of quadratic Gorenstein algebras.  In joint work with Mere, the PI investigated the G-quadratic and LG-quadratic properties for quotients of exterior algebras, showing that, as in the commutative case, there are Koszul algebras that are not LG-quadratic and LG-quadratic algebras that are not G-quadratic.  And in joint work with Mastroeni, the PI resolved a conjecture of Dotsenko by showing that Chow rings of matroids are Koszul.  These are commutative quadratic algebras that share many properties with cohomology rings of nice manifolds.  Their combinatorial properties have been used extensively by Huh and others to resolve long-standing combinatorial conjectures like the Heron-Rota-Welsh Conjecture.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/17/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason Mccullough"
