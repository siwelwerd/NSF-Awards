 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project intends to enhance listening comprehension skills via an innovative interactive learning platform that aligns with Common Core State Standards for listening comprehension and uses best practices in game-based learning. In 2017, 63% of U.S. 4th graders were reading below proficiency. Improving a students' level of listening comprehension in elementary school is the single greatest influence on his or her reading comprehension. Common Core State Standards now include guidelines for listening comprehension starting in kindergarten. However, most listening activities involve teachers reading aloud followed by written assessments that require decoding and encoding. Narrative audio content models fluency and prosody and helps bridge the gap between word recognition and comprehension without relying on decoding and encoding text. There are no other listening platforms designed for elementary schools and therefore there is a tremendous opportunity for this program to have significant commercial success. The project's long-range purpose is to improve listening skills at the time in a child's life when it matters the most. By utilizing compelling audio content that highlights the latest discoveries in science, technology and innovation, this project also meets the National Science Foundation's mission of 'promoting the progress of science'.\r\n\r\nThis project will break new ground and modernize the way listening comprehension is taught and assessed with an innovative interactive learning platform that takes traditional elements of game play and applies them to listening comprehension activities (i.e. vocabulary, fluency and comprehension). More specifically, each audio story will have embedded audio cues that lead to audio/visual comprehension questions, games and polls. The platform will include account management, student rostering, student progress monitoring, administrative dashboards and interactive teacher guides for using audio in the classroom. Studies show that both game-based learning and audio content increase motivation in students, however no studies examine the use of both game-based learning and audio together. The research conducted for this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use a qualitative design to best understand and describe how classroom teachers and students use and engage with the interactive audio platform. The goal is to conduct interviews with teachers and usability testing with students to ensure that platform features are engaging, feasible, easily integrated and demonstrate potential for intended educational outcomes. Lessons learned from this Phase I award will be applied during Phase II, when a more robust platform will be developed and commercialized.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
