 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy  (CHARA) optical interferometer array on Mt. Wilson is the nation's premiere facility for high angular resolution astronomy. This proposal describes a program to investigate binary stars and the disks of gas and dust that form around them.  Images of these debris disks can now be obtained for the closest and largest examples using CHARA. The first part of the program is aimed at determining the orientation of the binary orbits with respect to their surrounding disks. The second part is a survey of binary systems that are undergoing an intense stage of mass exchange between the stars. The third part will be a program to image a set of stellar disks and search for indications of spiral arms. Finally, they will use CHARA to search for faint companions in other systems. The program will directly support the continued training of a research scientist, a postdoctoral associate, and several Ph.D. students at Georgia State University, which operates the CHARA array. The work will be highlighted in the undergraduate courses taught at GSU, which has a very diverse student population with a large minority component, and advanced undergraduates will participate in work at CHARA.  The team will also support public outreach efforts at GSU and at Mt. Wilson, including the renewal of exhibits at the CHARA Visitors Gallery.\r\n\r\nThe project will provide us with fundamental data on binary star systems with disks in their youth and after their transformation through mass transfer and loss. The study of binaries in debris disks will show how disks act to form binary stars and, once formed, how the binary systems implant structures in the disks that will influence where and how planets are formed. Detection of circumbinary disks around strongly interacting binaries will show us how much mass and angular momentum are lost from the system during the peak of mass transfer. Observations of structures in the disks of Be stars will provide the means to test theories of tidal processes and disk perturbation modes that are important in our understanding of star and planet formation, accretion processes in X-ray binaries, and accretion onto supermassive black holes. Detection of the mass donor remnants orbiting rapidly rotating stars will reveal the products of binary star evolution and shed light on the processes that lead to other products of mass transfer (massive X-ray binaries, hydrogen deficient supernovae, long duration gamma-ray bursts, neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves from mergers).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

If two stars are born in close proximity, then the gas in the outer layers of the enlarged star is tugged away by the force of gravity of its neighbor. This has enormous consequences for the lives of both stars. The initially more massive star is the first to grow, and it will lose most of its outer gas layers to the companion. It will then appear as a stripped-down, hot core. The gas stream to the companion will be partially captured, causing the companion to grow in mass and spin up. Astronomers recognize a class of these spun up objects as B-emission line or Be stars. They rotate so fast that gas from their equator is launched into a surrounding disk, appearing like a stellar version of the planet Saturn with its rings. The Be stars vastly outshine the stripped-down cores, so it is very difficult to detect these remnants of mass transfer. Only a few cases are known thanks to observations with the Hubble Space Telescope in the ultraviolet colors where the hot cores are relatively brighter (see the depiction of the Phi Persei binary in Figure 1). Most Be stars are so far away that both components appear blended into a single point of light in conventional telescopes. However, the new technique of optical interferometry is now providing us with the means to see the individual components of distant binary pairs and to map their orbital motions.\n\n\nThe Georgia State University Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) operates the CHARA Array interferometer at Mount Wilson Observatory in the San Gabriel National Monument of southern California. The CHARA Array consists of six telescopes that are arranged in a Y-shaped configuration and are connected through light pipes that direct the beams into a central laboratory, acting like one enormous telescope (Figure 2). The six beams are sent into specialized cameras that record how the light waves combine. The resulting measurements provide information on the tiny details of the star's size, shape, and surroundings. The CHARA Array is especially sensitive to the light of faint and nearby companion stars, making the Array an ideal tool to discover the stripped-down cores orbiting Be stars.\n\n\nThis project supported an investigation with the CHARA Array of a sample of relatively nearby Be stars. Many of the stars were observed on more than one night, so that the orbital motion of the companions could be mapped for the first time. The survey led to the discovery of eight binary systems consisting of a bright Be star orbited by a faint hot core, and their orbital motions led to first estimates of their masses and distances. Figure 3 shows one example of the motion of a binary called 28 Cygni that takes about one year to complete an orbit. This work provides stunning examples of how stars in close binaries are radically transformed in appearance and properties through mass transfer.\n\n\nThese Be binary systems represent the outcome after the conclusion of mass transfer. The prior stage of large-scale mass transfer is short relative to lifetime of the binary, so such systems are rare. However, astronomers have identified a class of interacting stars known as W Serpentis binaries that show evidence of mass transfer and indeed mass ejection into their immediate vicinity. A second CHARA Array observing program surveyed the spatial properties of nine nearby W Serpentis systems. These measurements and new spectroscopic observations from the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico will show how much of the mass transfer is captured by the companion and how much is ejected back into space. The results are key to understanding how much of the mass of binary stars finally ends up in stellar corpses such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes.\n\n\nThis research program provided special opportunities for training in optics, astronomical instrumentation, and computer software for data analysis to two postdoctoral research associates and three Ph.D. graduate students from Georgia State University. A postdoctoral associate also devoted effort to the creation of informational posters that are shown on electronic displays in the CHARA Exhibit Hall at Mount Wilson Observatory. The Exhibit Hall is open to visitors to Mount Wilson Observatory and provides an excellent introduction to how interferometry works and how it is applied to many investigations in astrophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/08/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DouglasRGies\n"
