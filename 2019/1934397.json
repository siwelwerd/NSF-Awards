The SFF Symposium is widely considered the premier academic conference on additive manufacturing (AM) related research in the world. In 2018, it brought together 683 researchers from universities, national laboratories, and companies from 19 countries around the world, who together presented 529 technical presentations and posters during the 3-day event. \r\n\r\nBy attending and presenting their work at this symposium, students will have the opportunity to interact with leading researchers in their field, learn about cutting-edge research and challenging problems across the AM research community, and mature themselves professionally as future leaders in AM research and development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
