The main objective of the meeting was dissemination of new ideas and techniques, as well as providing an occasion for colleagues to interact, and particularly for younger colleagues and early career researchers to make contacts and learn about new research.\n\n \n\nPreceding the European Set Theory Conference was the Twelfth Young Set Theory Workshop, which had a synergistic effect on attendance for both the Conference and the Workshop.  While travel to the Young Set Theory workshop was not directly supported by the NSF many participants attended in both conferences.\n\n \n\nThe Hausdorff Medal\n\nA highlight of the meeting was the award of the Hausdorff medal to Itay Neeman.  Here is the official citation:\n\n \n\nThe Hausdorff medal 2019 for the most influential work in set theory in the previous 5 years was awarded to Itay Neeman for his work on the new method of iterating forcing using side conditions and the tree property. The committee cited the following papers for their fundamental contributions and for opening up the new directions of study:\n\n \n\n-  Forcing with sequences of models of two types, Notre Dame J.
