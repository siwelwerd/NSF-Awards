 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is motivated by fundamental problems arising in networks underlying enterprise and infrastructure systems. The diverse applications spanned in this project include cloud computing, datacenters, blockchain technologies, and networks of mobile devices. What is the best algorithm to map a collection of communicating processes in a cloud of heterogeneous servers? How should a large AI computation be embedded in a network of computers? How can the data-flow needs of a distributed system be effectively supported by the underlying datacenter network? Can a highly dynamic network support fast and reliable communication?  The focus of this project is on developing a rigorous algorithmic framework for studying these questions and designing efficient algorithms for the relevant problems.\r\n\r\nThe PI endeavors to translate the advances in algorithmic foundations of these problems to tangible benefits in the applications. The integrated educational component of the project includes experimental and measurement studies, several concrete directions for dissertation research, and a new course on \"Algorithms for Modern Networked Systems\". As part of an effort to broaden participation in computer-science foundations, the PI plans to lecture on graphs and their applications at a summer institute for participating middle- and high-school teachers from Boston-area schools. The ultimate goal is to engage young students from these schools and suggest a possible academic and professional future in CS to a diverse community.\r\n\r\nThe technical core of the project comprises three categories of algorithmic problems. The first component is on embedding distributed computations in arbitrary network topologies, with an emphasis on modeling heterogeneity in both the computational tasks and the network machines. The expected research contributions include (a) resolving the complexity of the minimum-stretch graph-retraction problem, which is a natural variant of classic metric embeddings, and (b) approximation algorithms for the communication-aware embedding of directed acyclic graphs. The second component is on embedding flows and their generalizations called coflows, which capture flow collections sharing a common performance goal. The aim here is to minimize objectives related to the response times of the flows, for general networks. Both the first and second components assume that the underlying network does not change with time. The third component of this project concerns embedding in dynamic networks. It seeks distributed algorithms for information flows in highly dynamic networks, and solutions to several temporal optimization problems for networks with known dynamics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nComputers are ubiquitous and computing has become a commodity, something as basic as electricity in our lives. People from all walks of life and organizations of all sizes rely on computing resources (e.g., data storage, communications, apps) from cloud providers, datacenters, and network providers. The nation's economic engine is heavily dependent on the efficiency and resilience of our computing infrastructure.\n\n\nIn this project, we designed efficient and effective algorithms for managing resources in our infrastructure such as datacenters and cloud systems. In particular, we developed the first algorithm with performance guarantees for scheduling jobs with complex dependencies (such as those that arise in AI inference tasks) in a distributed computer network. Our study has laid a novel framework for studying scheduling problems that need to account for dependencies among jobs and communication delays among computers.\n\n\n\nWe also developed improved algorithms for routing packet flows in network switches, near-optimal policies for managing dynamic data stored in big-data databases, and an improved algorithm for strategically migrating applications across machines to reduce communication overhead. We resolved an open problem in the field of network design, showing that every network contains a sparse sub-network that can be used effectively to communicate to any group of receivers. Our methods address numerous challenges, including scale (the massive size of the problems), complexity (the variety of resources and the many competing objectives), and uncertainty (the unknowns and the unpredictable).\n\n\n\nThis project has provided research training for four PhD students, two Master's students, and three undergraduates, several of whom are exploring advanced careers in computing. The project supported outreach to high schoolers, including a course on inspiring applications of algorithms for under-represented students and lectures in a summer program on the mathematics of computer science. The PI has also performed significant service to the research community, including as an Associate Editor for two journals in theoretical computer science and as a member of the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) Council, whose mission is \"to enable the pursuit of innovative, high-impact computing research that aligns with pressing national and global challenges.\"\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RajmohanRajaraman\n"
