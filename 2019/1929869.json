 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this workshop is to convene multi-disciplinary experts from utilities, private industry, academia, non-profits, and federal transportation, environmental and public health authorities to systematically address the interconnections between sub-systems of the Urban Infrastructure Grid and to identify potential pathways for cascading catastrophic failures and their impacts beyond the Grid. The group will develop a vision and roadmap towards a systems-based framework that can support standardized and integrated monitoring, analysis, control and management of the Urban Infrastructure Grid, and outline application case studies.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is targeted to advance a clearer understanding of the complexity of urban infrastructure systems and develop a vision and a roadmap towards their sustainable management for improved environmental sustainability and human health. A spectrum of dissemination strategies will continue the conversation in the community, seeking to excite interest in participation in potential case studies, and produce scalable, actionable information for stakeholders globally. Two workshop-related sessions will be organized around this topic: the first at the Annual Meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in December of 2019; and the second at the American Water Resources Association's 2020 Spring Specialty Workshop titled AWRA Geospatial Water Technology Workshop: Complex systems. Tribute to David Maidment. The results will be published in the AWRA Impact magazine.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
