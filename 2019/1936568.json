This project will provide scholarships for the next three years of the conference. Scholarships will facilitate attendance of undergraduate and graduate students; faculty from minority-serving institutions will attend and participate in conference activities, and a Doctoral Consortium will provide PhD students with group and one-on-one interactions with leaders in the field of computing.  The intellectual merit of this project is in the stimulating environment and knowledge provided by the excellent presentations and activities associated with the conference. The broader impact will consist largely in the connections made by the scholarship recipients with other attendees at the conference and with the entire breadth of the computer science field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
