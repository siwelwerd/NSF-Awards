 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the impacts of space weather, changes in the magnetic plasma environment surrounding the Earth, relies on basic definitions of how we measure extreme conditions. Geomagnetic storms represent the extremes of our local geospace environment and represent times when our national space-based assets (satellites for defense and commerce) are most vulnerable. This work will determine what conditions lead to extreme space weather through use of observational datasets and physics-based models of the space environment. The broader impacts include understanding space weather conditions during extreme conditions (a priority set out in the National Space Weather Action Plan) and training students and a post-doc on research in a Hispanic Serving Institution.\r\n\r\nThis project develops a new classification of geomagnetic storms based on overall storm energetics, with an emphasis on storms with large amounts of power dissipated in the ionosphere where the activity can have significant space weather consequences. A set of events will be selected that will represent the most energetic storms, including \"superstorms\" that occur under conditions of low Mach number solar wind flow. These events will be studied using both data and simulations (global MHD models run with and without a ring current module) to determine the controlling factors for energy transfer to the geospace system. The goal of this research is to create a comprehensive conceptual model that explains how the solar wind energy incident on the magnetosphere is transferred to the ionosphere and magnetosphere during periods of the relatively low solar wind Mach number that characterize large magnetic storms. The research will also identify to what extent current global models can capture the essential physics of that transfer and identify possible areas of missing physics that could contribute to a better correspondence between models and data.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
