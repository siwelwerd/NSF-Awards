 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year exploratory project responds to the urgent and persistent need to foster high-quality mathematics learning opportunities for children who are at risk of starting school behind their peers. There is a pressing need to invest in preK STEM efforts to build a solid basis for children's STEM skills later in life. Yet there is a dearth of high-quality instructional resources that integrate early mathematics and computational thinking (CT).  This project addresses this need by advancing research and development into how to foster preK children's (4-5-year-olds) mathematical knowledge and computational thinking. Specifically, this project will create and test a set of developmentally appropriate, play-based, problem-solving activities that integrate mathematics and computational thinking by engaging children in mathematical investigations with hands-on materials and the use of a digital tool to collect and display data. The team will target specific math skills that are naturally attractive to young children (such as counting and categorizing) and that provide a foundation for later academic math competencies in data collection and analysis, setting the stage for young children to succeed in mathematics and computational thinking tasks in elementary school and beyond.\r\n \r\nThe overarching goals of this project are to understand how young children can apply their mathematical knowledge (i.e., organizing data through counting, sorting, and classifying) to answer real-world questions and leverage computer technology to facilitate this learning. Using an iterative, design-based research approach, the team will (1) develop a set of 9 hands-on, play-based, real world learning activities, (2) develop an accompanying digital tool to collect and display data, both of which are intended to improve preschoolers' mathematical and computational thinking, (3) develop assessments intended to better understand preschoolers' mathematical and computational thinking, and in turn, (4) create and refine a learning blueprint and conjecture map that can inform early childhood curriculum development. Year 1 of the project involves the development of classroom instructional activities and assessment tasks through observational studies of children using the activities. The process will begin with defining the learning goals in a learning blueprint and detailing the specific outcomes in the conjecture map, which describes the theory of how these instructional activities will lead to improved learning outcomes. In Year 2, the research team will conduct two pilot tests of the instructional tasks in ten preschool classrooms that serve low-income children in the New York City and Boston metropolitan areas. Data collection will include observation and interviews with children, as well as teacher surveys and interviews. Year 3 will focus on data analysis and dissemination, as well the revision of instructional tasks based on study findings. In this way, the project has potential for transforming current conceptions of young children's computational thinking and narrow opportunity gaps in children's mathematical learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
