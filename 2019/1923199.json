 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project on Broadening Participation to Include African American and Hispanic Students with Disabilities in Computer Science Learning using Voice User Interface Project-Based Learning is a three-year project in the preK-12 pathways strand. The project is designed to study and increase African Americans and Hispanics with disabilities' interest, engagement, learning, knowledge, and persistence in computer science education (CS) and careers. The study will employ quasi-experimental methods to investigate the effects of activities on district CS policies and implementation. Changing Expectations Corporation will leverage its existing network of teachers in the Changing Expectations WeTeach_CS Collaborative Computer Science Education Community of Practice, practitioners in Texas school districts, special educators, researchers and evaluators to form the Students with Disabilities in Computer Science Research Alliance (SWDCS).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
