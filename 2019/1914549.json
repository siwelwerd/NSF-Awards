 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.  Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe and can be used to test fundamental physics.  The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, located on the slopes of the Sierra Negra in Mexico, is a ground-based facility designed with unique capabilities to observe very high-energy gamma rays.  This award supports scientists at Michigan Technological University doing research with HAWC.  In addition to hardware and service activities to support HAWC operations, the group will analyze HAWC data to study the origin of cosmic rays.  The group will engage in education and outreach activities, including a research experience for K-12 science educators. The main goal is to develop a physics curriculum that teaches high school students the scientific methods currently used in astrophysics research.\r\n\r\nHigh-energy gamma rays are produced when cosmic rays interact with their local environment, interstellar matter and radiation fields.  As neutral particles these gamma-rays can be traced back to their origin and used to provide critical information on the origin of cosmic rays.  The Michigan group will tackle the question of the birth, acceleration, and transport of cosmic rays by studying the energy dependent flux and morphology of the gamma-ray emission from a variety of source classes: Star Forming Regions, Super Nova Remnants, Pulsar Wind Nebulae, Galactic Diffuse Emission, Molecular Clouds, and Star Burst Galaxies. The results using data from the HAWC Observatory will complement and be combined with multi-wavelength and multi-messenger measurements by other space and ground-based observatories, thus addressing the goals of NSF's \"Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics\" Big Idea.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The highest energy gamma rays are detected by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory located at 4100 m altitude near the highest mountain in Mexico, Pico de Orizaba, also known as Citlalt&eacute;petl, which is Nahuatl and translates to star mountain. The gamma rays HAWC detects originate from interactions in or near the most powerful particle accelerators known to humanity.

The particles that are accelerated are atomic nuclei, with protons being prevalent. They are called cosmic rays. The goal of the research supported by this NSF grant was to study how cosmic rays travel and distribute throughout space, and if the sources mentioned above are the long sought-after PeVatrons, which are believed to be the highest-energy sources of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. PeVatrons accelerate protons to petaelectronvolts (PeVs), an enormous amount of kinetic energy capable of hurling subatomic particles thousands of light-years across the galaxy.
