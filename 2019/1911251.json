 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority populations (African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders) to successfully complete high quality degree programs in STEM.   The program also supports research in broadening participation in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff, lead institution for the Arkansas Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ARK-LSAMP), will implement a new STEM Pathways and Research Alliance (SPRA) project over a five-year duration (2019-2023).  Eight two-and four-year institutions comprise the ARK-LSAMP alliance and will implement the interventions.  In addition to UAPB, the participating institutions are:  Arkansas State University (ASU), Philander Smith College (PSU), the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville (UAF) and the University of Arkansas-Little Rock (UALR), Phillips Community College of the University of Arkansas (PCCUA), Southeast Arkansas College (SEARK) and Pulaski Technical College (PTC).  The alliance is led by a minority-serving institution and includes both minority (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) and non-minority-serving institutions. The project will be implemented in an Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) jurisdiction to enhance STEM research and educational capability and capacity. \r\n\r\nThe ARK-LSAMP SPRA project proposes to increase the number of community college transfer students to STEM four-year programs and to increase the number of STEM B. S. degrees to the targeted populations.  The main emphasis of the project is to study eight variables related to persistence at the undergraduate level and entry into STEM graduate studies.  As a means of testing the impact of college readiness and co-curricular interventions on the recruitment, retention, graduation and graduate school entry of ARK-LSAMP, the research study is guided by the following research questions:\r\n1. Which pre-college readiness experiences best predict the enrollment of URM in STEM academic disciplines?\r\n2. Which co-curricular interventions best predict persistence and graduation for URM students in STEM majors?\r\n3. Which co-curricular interventions best predict entry into graduate STEM education programs?\r\n4. Which academic co-curricular interventions best predict entry into post-baccalaureate\r\nemployment in a STEM field?\r\n\r\nRecruitment and retention strategies to be employed by ARK-LSAMP include continuing its Pre-First Year Summer Institute, undergraduate research experiences, mentoring and advising, and STEM professional development activities that include student conference attendance and research presentation nationally and abroad.  The alliance has placed an emphasis on increasing male and Hispanic participation in STEM in the region during this project period. \r\n\r\nA mixed-methods process and impact evaluation will be conducted during the project period.  Broad sharing of project findings from implementation, research and evaluation will be conducted through institutional websites, social media, brochures, newsletters.  Dissemination to non-academic sectors, such the Arkansas Economic Development community, is also planned.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
