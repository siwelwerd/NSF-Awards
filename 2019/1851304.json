 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social norms, those informal understandings that guide our behavior in everyday life, are difficult to study scientifically because they are both challenging to define and to measure. Yet they regulate a large body of social behavior and also help to pattern social inequality.  This project will advance our scientific understanding of inequality by developing a new approach that identifies social norms in written texts describing correct behaviors. The project will inductively derive the relationships between behaviors prescribed and proscribed in the texts and more measurable dimensions of inequality, such as social class. The project will also uncover the connections between those written norms and the social boundaries and exclusions that create inequality.  The project will inform understanding regarding the pervasiveness of social inequality that has previously been resistant to scientific study and will provide evidence regarding how social norms change over time.\r\n \r\nThe project will study social norms through analysis of an original digital corpus consisting of texts describing correct behaviors. The corpus includes more than 7 million words and 90,000 pages of text produced during the last 95 years. The research uses multiple methods including corpus linguistics analytic techniques of topic modeling, word embedding, word network mapping, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. These strategies will identify social norms, symbolic boundaries, techniques for the enforcement of norm compliance, and narratives of justification attaching moral values to social norms. Machine learning will be guided by and supplement traditional by-hand content analysis of texts from the same corpus. The project will also use archival research to place the research findings in their social and historical contexts. Through these methods, the research will produce a new approach to studying social norms and inequality. The results will fuel discussion of the cultural foundations of social inequality as well as shed light on how social norms generally both operate and evolve historically.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project developed a new approach that identifies social norms in written texts describing everyday behaviors. Using emerging tools in data science and applying them to sociological questions, the project uncovered changes in social class distinction-making by examining the relationships between behaviors prescribed and proscribed in the texts and accepted dimensions of social class position. The project also uncovered the connections between those written norms and the social boundaries associated with immigrant incorporation into the mainstream of society. By using a corpus of texts describing the social significance of everyday behaviors, the project describes social change over time, furthers the ability of research to connect micro- and macro-social processes, and informs understanding regarding the pervasiveness of social inequality that has previously been resistant to scientific study.</p>\n<p>More specifically, the project focused on computational and qualitative analysis of an original corpus consisting of texts describing correct behaviors. The corpus includes more than 7 million words and 90,000 pages of text produced between 1922 and 2017. The research used multiple methods including corpus linguistics analytic techniques of topic modeling, word embedding, word network mapping, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. These strategies identified social norms, symbolic boundaries, techniques for the enforcement of norm compliance, and narratives of justification attaching moral values to social norms. Machine learning was guided by and supplemented traditional by-hand content analysis of the same texts.

The first article uses a computational technique called word embeddings combined with qualitative text analysis to examine how the elements of class related to social distinction-making change over time. We isolate and quantify the salience of six dimensions of class -- affluence, cultivation, education, employment, morality, and status -- to class distinction-making within a corpus of etiquette books published between 1922 and 2017. We find that education and employment are increasingly salient dimensions while status, affluence, cultivation, and morality decline as salient dimensions of class distinction-making (see Figure 1). These results signal a decline of class operating as a status group through cultural closure, the rise of education and employment as the carriers of class in everyday life, and the corresponding legitimation of class position and class inequality on the basis of supposedly meritocratic grounds.</p>\n<p>In the second article, we use the text corpus to identify mainstream shifts associated with the incorporation of groups which once were and may currently still be seen as immigrant outsiders in the United States: Catholic, Chinese, Cuban, Irish, Italian, Jewish, Mexican, and Muslim groups. The analysis takes a computational approach, combining qualitative readings and directed and undirected computational text analyses. Two computational approaches make it possible to examine mainstream shifts in these corpora. First, we use sentiment analysis to observe the positive sentiment in each corpus and its change over time. Second, we observe changes in each text's position on a semantic dimension represented by the poles of \"normal\" and \"strange.\" The results indicate mainstream shifts through movement from normal to strange over time for most of the group-specific corpora (see Figures 6 and 7).</p>\n<p>Taken together, these articles will fuel discussion of the cultural foundations of social inequality, shed light on how social norms generally both operate and evolve historically, and also support the development of theory and methods for research using texts that describe everyday life and everyday behaviors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/01/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Andrea&nbsp;Voyer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1851304/1851304_10590010_1653307708058_figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1851304/1851304_10590010_1653307708058_figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1851304/1851304_10590010_1653307708058_figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Salience of Different Dimensions of Class in the Text Corpus</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">preprint: Voyer, A., Kline, Z.
