 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lignin is a polymeric material from plants that is currently burned for energy in biorefinery processes.  The goal of this project is to convert lignin to other potentially more valuable products in an electrochemical reactor.  This would yield potentially higher-value uses for lignin, which could improve biorefinery economics and eventually reduce the cost to produce next-generation biofuels.  In addition, products generated from lignin could replace chemicals currently sourced from petroleum. Reduced dependence on petroleum could address the United States' energy and materials security. Currently, the mechanism governing conversion of lignin is not well-understood. This project seeks to address that fundamental issue by investigating the conversion of less complex model compounds that share some features with lignin.  Generating better understanding of how these reactions occur would advance the field of biomass conversion and could eventually lead to a more environmentally friendly way to generate biofuels and bioproducts. This project also contains an educational outreach program focused on high school students in Appalachia who are underrepresented in the STEM fields. The outreach program seeks to increase Appalachian students' matriculation in the STEM fields at four-year colleges and universities, which would diversify STEM workers' backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop better understanding of the reaction pathways that dominate electrochemical conversion of lignin.  Because of the complexity of the lignin biopolymer, the PIs will work with lignin model compounds that share key features with lignin itself.  The project will involve the electrochemical oxidizidation of the lignin model compounds at different electrode potentials, and the use of NMR spectroscopy to determine structural changes resulting from electrochemical oxidation.  This analysis will be used to elucidate the reaction mechanism.  The PIs hypothesize that two major reactions pathways are likely possible:  direct electrochemical conversion or indirect conversion mediated by hydroxyl radicals.  Additional of hydroxyl radical scavengers will help determine the relative importance of the hydroxyl radical mediated reaction.  Once the reaction pathway models have been developed using the lignin model compounds, the PIs will compare and assess the model?s descriptions on lignin itself, determining how well the reaction pathways describe the actual reaction mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to identify the mechanism governing electrochemical conversion of lignin model compounds and the lignin biopolymer.  It was unclear whether electrochemical conversion proceeded by a direct electrochemical method, or whether electrochemical generation of OH radicals leads to OH radical attack as the governing mechanism.  Intellectual merit included the use of lignin model compounds, because these compounds have known chemistry and structure, and we can make solutions containing only one compound.  The use of lignin model compounds simplifies analysis.  Another intellectual merit was the use of statistical analysis to identify changes upon oxidation.  Another intellectual merit was the use of a radical scavenger as a means to identify whether OH radicals played a role in the reaction mechanism.  We were able to determine that electrochemical oxidation of lignin model compounds follows a direct electrochemical route and that the oxidation products retain the aromaticity of the original model compound.\n\nWe next extended this work to the lignin biopolymer.  Using the same experimental techniques and conditions, and the same statistical analysis, we were able to determine that the mechansim governing lignin conversion is likely OH radical-mediated, and is unselective.  We identified many oxidation products over a wide range of mass/charge ratios upon electrochemical oxidation of lignin.  When adding the radical scavenger, however, we observed oxidation products over a smaller range of mass/charge ratios, with overall lower mass/charge ratios, indicating that when OH radicals are not available for attack, another more selective depolymerization mechanism occurs.\n\nBroader impacts of this project include development of the statistical tools necessary to adequately analyze biomass and its oxidation products.  Much work has been reported on the electrochemical conversion of biomass like lignin, and this project indicates that adequate and detailed analysis must include statistical components.  Another broader impact is identification of the reaction mechanisms governing the conversion of lignin model compounds and the lignin biopolymer.  The results of this project indicate that the mechansims governing those two classes of compounds are different.\n\nWe planned for educational outreach as another broader impact, but were unable to contact students directly because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Future work will involve direct engagement with local high school students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Staser"
