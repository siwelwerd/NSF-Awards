 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award seeks to support U.S. student participation in the Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW), being organized as part of the 24th ACM International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP), the premier conference on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming. The event is in Berlin, Germany during 18-23 August 2019. This award specifically supports students from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents to attend the mentoring workshop in addition to the ICFP conference. The impact of the award relates to broadening participation in computing, providing opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners with general expertise in programming languages, and specific expertise in functional programming.\r\n\r\nStudents attending the PLMW workshop with support from this grant will hear eminent researchers in the field talk about the latest trends in the field, and get one-on-one mentoring from these speakers and other mentors in research and pursuing their career aspirations. The connections formed at this event will help create lasting connections between researchers and students, thereby shaping emerging innovations in computer programming languages.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of the Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) has been to develop the next generation of programming languages researchers and to encourage women and underrepresented minorities to join the programming language research community. Building on the tremendous success of the prior workshops, which have been colocated with premier programming languages conferences since 2012, this project supported the 2019 instance of PLMW at the International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) to introduce and mentor students who have already shown interest in programming languages research by bringing them to ICFP so they can learn about current research problems and interact with leaders in the field.\n\nThe major impact of this project is in the advancement of a new cohort of programming languages researchers and the substantially improved participation of women and underrepresented minorities.\n\nThe Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop at ICFP 2019 was held on Sunday, August 18 in Berlin, Germany, co-located with the SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming, held the following three days.\n\nThe workshop was organized by David Van Horn (University of Maryland), Kathryn Gray (Facebook), and Nate Foster (Cornell).\n\nThe program consisted of technical talks, mentoring talks, a social event, and a panel discussion.  Speakers represented a diverse collection of international researchers from both industry and academia, with a wide range of seniority:\n\nThe workshop aimed to encourage women and underrepresented minorities to join the programming language research community.  To achieve this goal, the organizers worked to attract participants who would not normally attend ICFP.  This objective guided the selection of speakers and funded students.\n\nThere were 45 attendees, of which 38 were students, and 24 were supported with financial aid.\n\nOf the technical and mentoring talks, 50% of the speakers were women or members of underrepresented minorities.\n\nOf students, 24% reported being members of underrepresented minorities, which is signifcantly fewer than the prior year (50%) and a return to the level two years prior (24%).  The organizers have taken steps to address this issue for PLMW @ ICFP 2020.  Of the NSF supported, US-based students, 25% reported being members of underrepresented minorities.\n\nAdditionally, an indepent report was prepared by the CRA Center for Evaluating the Research Pipeline to evaluate the effectiveness of the workshop after it occurred.\n\nStudents attending the workshop had the opportunity to attend a one day development workshop and interact with their peer cohort and a wide-range of international researchers of varying seniority.  The talks included technical tutorials which gave overviews of ongoing research areas in programming languages.  The mentoring talks covered topics relevant to succeeding in graduate school and as a researcher.  The social event helped student make connections withing their cohort and among the researchers.\n\nStudents also attended the main ICFP conference and were able to see the cutting edge research results in programming languages.  They also had to opportunity to meet with the ICFP and StrangeLoop audience to make professional network connections.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Van Horn"
