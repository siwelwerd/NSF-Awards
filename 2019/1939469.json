A research vessel in the Gulf of Mexico will help to support scientifically important work in geological, geophysical and biological processes.   Studying  \"societally\" relevant topics such as sea level rise, changing weather and climate patterns, and the implications for scientifically and commercially important ecosystems and species.\r\n\r\n The Gulf of Mexico is also an economic hotspot for fisheries, energy, tourism, etc. Louisiana and Mississippi are both EPSCOR states, and operating this vessel is its own kind of economic stimulation. The consortium is committed to improving diversity and inclusivity in the southern U.S.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
