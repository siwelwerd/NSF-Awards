 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to lay the foundations for significant increases in global crop yields by improving the efficiency of carbon uptake in a plant. The research plan involves transferring key components of pyrenoids found in algae, into a plant, Arabidopsis, in order to improve photosynthesis. Pyrenoids are sub-cellular microcompartments that are found in the chloroplast of several algae and are involved in carbon fixation. The project consists of three aims that are each targeted at engineering one of the key components of the pyrenoid into Arabidopsis, and one computational aim that develops a quantitative model of pyrenoid function to support the other three aims. These four aims synergize to produce a minimal, functional pyrenoid in Arabidopsis. The work contributes to meeting the 2050 global food demand with minimal ecological impacts. The project trains high school, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral scientists in each of two principal participating laboratories and launches them onto the next stages of their careers. The project team is engaging industry and philanthropic organizations to facilitate translation of advances to crops. The team is sharing their research with the general public through outreach talks to general audiences at venues such as science caf's, through social media such as Twitter, and by improving Wikipedia pages. \r\n\r\nAs a key step towards enhancing crop yields, this project aims to enhance CO2 uptake of the model plant Arabidopsis by engineering it with a minimal synthetic CO2 uptake mechanism derived from components of the pyrenoid from green algae. The project consists of three aims, each targeted at engineering one of the key components of the pyrenoid into Arabidopsis. The research plan involves (a) reconstituting a pyrenoid matrix in higher plants, (b) placing the Rubisco matrix around thylakoids containing bicarbonate transporters and (c) placing the pyrenoidal carbonic anhydrase into the thylakoid lumen. Computational methods are used throughout the project to develop a quantitative model of pyrenoid function that would drive further investigations. To support the plant engineering efforts, the investigators perform targeted research in algae and in vitro. The project benefits from an outstanding international team with a strong track record of collaboration in advancing both basic knowledge of the pyrenoid and the ability to engineer algal components into higher plants.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UKRI Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
