 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a growing recognition that microbial organisms are not simply agents of disease, but play important positive roles in the everyday health of plants and animals. Much of this paradigm change has been driven by the availability of new DNA sequencing technologies that enable accurate quantification of the normally hidden microbial biodiversity. While there has been a great deal of research on the effects of the microbiome on human health, understanding the role of microbial symbiosis in structuring natural ecosystems is a current research frontier in ecology. This project will build on a long-term research program by the investigator who has used DNA based techniques to establish key patterns in the diversity and ecology of one the most common forms of plant-microbe cooperation - mycorrhizal symbiosis. Using this knowledge, the project will determine how mycorrhizal symbiosis affects the diversity, productivity, and composition of natural plant communities. Given that over 90% of all plants engage in mycorrhizal symbiosis, better understanding of these interactions will help scientists and land managers sustain robust and resilient ecosystems.  In addition, this project will support development of an integrated teaching and research program to train undergraduates to use publicly available DNA sequence data and citizen science data to build species distribution models for fungi, and then publicly disseminate this information to help inspire public science participation.\r\n   \r\nWhile molecular tools have finally enabled increasingly accurate description of the diversity and structure of mycorrhizal fungal communities, this new information has not been well integrated with existing theoretical frameworks for plant ecology. This project will use an established research system on mycorrhizal fungi in coastal California as the basis for greenhouse, field, and modeling experiments designed to identify the mechanisms and conditions under which mycorrhizal fungi strongly influence plant species coexistence at local, landscape, and regional scales. This will be carried out through a combination of greenhouse studies that manipulate the presence of mycorrhizal fungi and observe the effects on plant competition, field experiments testing the effects of mycorrhizal symbiosis for organic matter decomposition under different environmental conditions, and simulation modeling to predict the effects of mycorrhizal symbiosis on patterns of vegetation development over large spatial and temporal scales.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In addition to their importance as decomposers that recycle organic matter in soils, they also have important roles as symbionts of living plants, both as pathogens that reduce plant growth and as mutualists that promote plant growth. While we know that mutualistic fungi that associate with plant roots &ndash; mycorrhizal fungi &ndash; are extremely common, the impacts that these fungi have on the dynamics of their host plants are not well established. The primary aim of this project was to rectify a knowledge gap about the effects of mycorrhizal fungi on plant community dynamics by incorporating recently developed ecological theory to measure the specific ways in which mycorrhizal fungi affect the outcome of competition between plant species. We did this primarily through a manipulative experiment controlling the presence of different types of mycorrhizal fungi and varying the species identity and density of competing plant seedlings. Using this framework we were able to show first that whether two plant species will coexist or whether one species will outcompete the other changes entirely depending on the identity of the mycorrhizal fungi present. This demonstrates that fungal mutualisms are essential in determining the success of plant species and observed patterns of vegetation. It also has practical implications in agriculture, forestry, and restoration. In addition, we quantify for the first time both how mycorrhizal fungi increase the likelihood of plant species coexisting by causing plant species to use different nutrient pools (which reduces the intensity of competition) and at the same time how fungal stimulation of plant growth can create a competitive advantage for one species. This work illustrates that a comprehensive understanding of how mycorrhizal fungi affect plant community dynamics is possible through understanding how these nutrient niche and plant fitness effects vary across environments.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the primary focus on mycorrhizal mediation of plant competition, we have also made other key insights into how mycorrhizal fungi affect plant communities dynamics when fungal performance is influenced by different biological and physical features of the environment. For example, we were able to complete the first study identifying key mycorrhizal fungal genes that are differentially regulated in response to short and long-term water deficits during mycorrhizal symbiosis. In addition to identifying stress response genes, another important finding was that there is high genetic potential for fungal acclimation to environmental stress. This discovery shows that fungal acclimation may be an underappreciated plant adaptation mechanism. Similarly, we used advanced molecular techniques to discover that there are common soil bacteria that form a three-way symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi and plants. The presence of these bacteria improves the growth of both the mycorrhizal plants and fungi. We were also able to show that through this tripartite symbiosis, the presence of mycorrhizal fungi strongly changes the composition of soil microbial food webs. In addition to providing fundamental insight into this ubiquitous symbiosis, these studies indicate ways in which microbial partnerships might be leveraged to create more resilient and productive plant communities in both natural and managed systems.</p>\r\n<p>This project also enabled me to contribute to training and career development of a competitive workforce.
