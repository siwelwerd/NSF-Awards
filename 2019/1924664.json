 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to study hypoxia in a tropical embayment in Panama (Bahia del Amirante) using a combination of ongoing monitoring data, new observations, and a numerical model. The project will focus on physical processes unique to tropical systems. Hypoxia, whereby marine waters become severely depleted in oxygen content, is a widespread deleterious anthropogenic influence on estuarine and coastal waters and is increasing in coastal regions globally. Hypoxia in tropical marine systems is poorly understood and understudied, despite the important implications for tropical ecosystems which sustain important fisheries habitats and coastal biodiversity. The project will include a field campaign to observe the physical and chemical parameters of the Bay as well as a modeling component to simulate the dynamic and biogeochemical responses and interpret the observational data. The project is expected to provide new understanding of the dynamics that initiate and control hypoxia in tropical systems. The results of this project will be disseminated through presentations at scientific meetings, seminars at universities, public talks, websites, and peer-reviewed journal articles. Communication of results to the broader scientific community will include a workshop on \"Understanding hypoxia in the Caribbean\" to be held in Panama in the third year of the grant. This workshop will bring together researchers from throughout the Caribbean working on diverse hypoxic systems with local Panamanian researchers and other stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis project includes an observational campaign and numerical simulations that will address the dynamics of hypoxia in shallow tropical systems. Physical and chemical measurements are designed to identify the important physical processes throughout the evolution of a seasonal hypoxic event in the Bay. Bahia Almirante is a tropical embayment in the Bocas del Toro region of Panama that has experienced repeated, seasonal hypoxia resulting in widespread bleaching and mortality of corals and other invertebrates. A fully-coupled physical biogeochemical model will be developed for the bay to test the dynamical understanding. The project will also leverage a historical record of weekly observations (temperature, salinity and oxygen) by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) since 2010 to give historical context to our observations and to provide validation for the simulations. The physical processes regulating the ventilation of low-oxygen bottom waters in temperature coastal regions include inflow of fresh water and atmospheric fluxes, which affect density stratification, advection, and wind, wave, and tidal-driven turbulent mixing. A better understanding of the physical mechanisms and environmental conditions responsible for oxygen variability in tropical bays will yield rich insight into benthic ecology, turbulent mixing, larval connectivity, coastal hypoxia, ocean acidification and cross-shelf exchange of nutrients, pollutants, hypoxic waters.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

First, an extensive bathymetric mapping study was undertaken by partners at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute to provide high-resolution bathymetry of Baha Almirante (the methods and bathymetry from this work have been presented at conferences by Panamanian researcher, Ximena Boza). Second, the relationship between physical and chemical parameters of water quality in coastal rivers and its relation to land cover was outlined in a manuscript published in Frontiers in Water (Clark et al. 2022). Third, we used existing large scale model output (HYCOM) to understand the mesoscale processes influencing coastal circulation in and around Bahia Almirante which in turn, control the renewal of bottom waters within the bay. In a manuscript currently in review at the Journal of Physical Oceanography, we show how, westward-propagating Caribbean Current eddies modify circulation in the western Caribbean Sea, influencing Panama-Colombia Gyre and coastal currents near Bahia Almirante. This work was led by a postdoctoral scholar supported by the project, Dr. Sam Kastner, who is now an assistant professor at Western Washington University.\n\n\n\nTo communicate the results of this work we organized a one-day symposium entitled Linking Environmental Conditions Across the Landscapes and Seascapes of Bahia Almirante to Biodiversity and Human Well-Being in Panama City, Panama which featured PIs, students, technicians, and post-docs. Presentations covered different aspects of Bahia Almirante, many related to the hypoxia in the bay and its impacts on the reef environment. The symposium, held in the Smithsonians Tupper complex in Panama City was open to the public and widely advertised around the local universities, NGOs and relevant government departments.

We submitted this paper for publication in Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science in September 2023 and it is currently in review. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/14/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KristenADavis\n"
