 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources (IUSE: EHR), this project aims to serve the national interest by examining how students benefit from Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs). Evidence suggests that early, authentic research experiences have a more positive affect than traditional learning contexts on college students' STEM learning, motivation, and academic plans. Unfortunately, opportunities for undergraduate research are available to relatively few students. Although traditional undergraduate laboratory classes can support a large number of students, they do not typically engage students in discovery and iteration, which are characteristics of authentic research. A solution that provides more students with greater access to an \"authentic\" research experience is the CURE. CUREs combine many of the authentic features of a faculty member's research lab with the larger capacity of a course environment. This scalability and authenticity have led to growth of CURE programs and expansion across colleges and universities. As CURE offerings spread, however, the enthusiasm for them has not been matched by a consistent approach to evaluation or educational theory grounding. Therefore, research is needed to assist instructors in understanding how CUREs work, when CUREs are most effective, and who CUREs benefit. Addressing this gap in the literature will contribute to improving undergraduate STEM education in the United States by providing evidence and tools to improve the quality of research opportunities experienced in course settings. In turn, access to these improved research opportunities can increase the retention of potential STEM majors who are vulnerable to exiting the major early in their academic careers, including those from groups underrepresented in STEM fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough assessment of some pre-/post-CURE student outcomes has been conducted, it is not yet documented how students experience and react to various CURE course design features, such as iterative experimentation and dealing with ill-defined, complex tasks.  In addition, it remains unknown how students react to CURES over a semester-long experience. Finally, it is not known how the instance and emphasis of different features of CURE courses throughout a semester interact with student interest to increase (or decrease) students' motivation to persist in a course of study. This project will address these gaps in the literature by: 1) Developing a taxonomy of \"authentic research\" characteristics for systematic classification of CUREs across departments and institutions; 2) Measuring how student interest (based on motivation theory) varies over the course of a given CURE as a result of these course characteristics; and 3) Exploring interactions between course characteristics, student interest, and longer-term STEM persistence and career goals. The project aims to complete these tasks by studying course design and student outcomes in a natural sample of undergraduate CURE courses at three universities: a research-focused private, a research-focused public, and an undergraduate-focused public. Data collection will include a combination of quantitative (syllabus analysis and student interest surveys) and qualitative (student interviews) research methods. The results of this study will expand practitioners' knowledge of course-based approaches to STEM engagement. It will also inform those in the STEM education research community who are interested in studying CUREs with new research questions to explore.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project was motivated by research showing that CUREs promote students overall learning, confidence, sense of belonging, and intent to persist in STEM disciplines more than traditional lectures. While prior research investigates the impact of CUREs using a pre-to-posttest design, this project considers how student interest unfolds over a semester in a CURE. This was achieved by defining and organizing CURE course design features to facilitate comparisons across CURE courses and understand how common CURE features influence students week-by-week experiences. Key project outcomes include: 1) a CURE course features classification that can be utilized for CURE course design and evaluation across institutional and departmental contexts and 2) investigation of the key drivers underlying student interest development over the course of a CURE semester, including students personal connection to the content, frustration levels, engagement in hands-on learning, as well as interactions with peers and professors. Taken together, this study highlights how CURE instructors can sustain student interest in their courses by promoting utility-value interventions, encouraging peer learning, and offering guidance to mitigate student frustration. Through deepening our understanding of CURE course design and students week-by-week experiences in CURE courses, this project helps to optimize the key student outcomes that these courses intend to provide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nIntellectual Merit: This study evaluated the extent to which various institutions, departments, and instructors implement assumed features of CUREs (such as developing unanswered research questions and conducting authentic experiments). Through interviews held with instructors across the biosciences, this study identified 112 CURE course features that are common in CURE implementation across contexts. These course features were organized into student experiences with the following: 1) use of the scientific process, 2) use of technical methods and protocols, 3) building skills in professional behaviors, and 4) receiving mentorship and scientific identity development. This classification contributes to the field by facilitating comparisons across CURE courses operating in different institutions and informing future investigations about what specific CURE course features may contribute to desired STEM outcomes. This study is also novel in that it considers student's week-by-week experiences in CUREs, providing insight into the mechanisms that drive outcomes provided by CUREs. For example, findings revealed that students levels of frustration and meaning- making (i.e., personal connection to the course) are key drivers of student interest in CURE courses. In the long run, high levels of meaning-making in a CURE are predictive of important gains reported by students a year later, including their science identity, self-efficacy, and motivation in science. Ultimately, this project expands practitioners knowledge of course-based approaches to STEM engagement. They also provide STEM education researchers interested in studying CUREs with a new phase of research questions. Since CUREs are increasingly becoming a key solution to engage more undergraduates in STEM research, it is critical to understand how students experience these courses and achieve the outcomes associated with discovery-based learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nBroader Impacts: This project offers important contributions to the field of undergraduate biology and STEM education by sharing findings on CURE course features and student experiences that can be leveraged to improve student outcomes across the United States. It promotes CURE course features that can be implemented across institutions and uncovers the mechanisms in CUREs that contribute to desired student outcomes in STEM. This project also encourages STEM educators and administrators to consider students psychological and social needs within discovery-based learning environments. Not only are psychosocial variables such as sense of belonging linked to increased STEM persistence, but they are particularly important for underrepresented students in undergraduate STEM education. Therefore, this work contributes to making undergraduate STEM education more supportive for all -- advancing a STEM workforce that represents the many perspectives needed to meet the challenges of the modern world.\r\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/22/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MarkJGraham\n"
