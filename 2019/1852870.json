 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, this Track 1 project at Ithaca College aims to serve the national need of increasing the number of highly-qualified mathematics and science teachers who remain in the teaching profession. Summer internships, an alternative spring break teaching institute, and collaborative partners will aid in recruiting scholars, including those from underrepresented groups. The project will provide opportunities for the scholars to participate in enhanced professional development activities such as teaching conferences, workshops on teaching in high need schools, and a summer teaching workshop. Project goals include expanding recruitment efforts, improving instruction with a focus on inquiry-based pedagogy, fostering a culture of continuous professional growth, and conducting a detailed evaluation of teacher retention and success.\r\n \r\nThis project will provide stipend support for 49 individuals who possess bachelor's degrees in a STEM discipline as they complete a 13-month master's level teacher certification program. The master's program includes the Master of Arts in Teaching in Adolescence Education for grades 7-12 and the Master of Science in Childhood Education for grades 1-6. Scholars, with undergraduate STEM degrees, will complete the requirements for teacher licensure in biology, chemistry, earth science, mathematics, physics, or childhood education. School partners include Elmira, NYC District #5, Horseheads, and Watkins Glen, as well as Cornell University, SUNY Cobleskill, RIT, Sciencenter, Lime Hollow Center, and Paleontological Research Institution. The project will conduct a multi-year research study to examine the impact of a preservice culture of continuous learning, growth, and professional development on future teacher engagement, confidence in handling challenges, participation in leadership activities, and teacher retention. This study seeks to add new knowledge to inform other teacher preparation programs across the nation about strategies for improving retention of new teachers. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 mathematics and science teachers in high-need school districts and experienced and exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
