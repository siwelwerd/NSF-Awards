 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Oceanography Society (TOS) will publish a special issue of the journal Oceanography on the topic of ocean warming with the overarching goal of providing a comprehensive, accessible, and authoritative summary of the state of the science of this globally important topic. Oceanography Editor Dr. Ellen Kappel, along with three guest editors who are experts in the field, Drs. Paul Durack, Lars Smedsrud, and Alex Sen Gupta, will oversee the content of the special issue. Distribution of the issue will include: (1) mailing hard copies to TOS members, more than half of whom are ocean sciences graduate students; (2) providing extra hard copies at meetings of opportunity; (3) posting articles on the open access Oceanography website and promoting their availability through social media, the TOS website, and TOS newsletters; and (4) distributing full digital versions to instructors, or multiple hard copies for classroom use, upon request. TOS plans to follow up a year post-publication to measure outcomes and impact.\r\n\r\nThe special issue of the journal will cover topics such as Upper- and deep-ocean warming, Interannual to multidecadal ocean variability, hurricane impacts-wave climate modeling, Arctic/Northern warming, warming and vulnerability of subsea permafrost and associated methane deposits, Atlantic warming since the Little Ice Age (flux estimates, overall warming, sea level rise), Ice sheet modeling, Arctic amplification and sea ice loss, coral bleaching, changing Arctic ecosystems, categorizing and naming marine heat waves, ocean acoustics, and marine host-pathogen dynamics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
