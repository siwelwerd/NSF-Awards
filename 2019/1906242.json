 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow who will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Habitat loss from urbanization is a threat to species biodiversity. Most studies compare rural and urban biodiversity, rather than looking at how the species present in one location change through time. Museum collections can provide valuable historical data on what species have been collected in an area for decades. The fellow will use the bee and ant specimens at the North Carolina State University Insect Museum to understand biodiversity change in Wake, Durham, and Chatham counties, North Carolina. These counties contain three metropolitan areas that have undergone extensive urban growth. Bees pollinate a large proportion of agricultural crops, and are critically important in maintaining native plant biodiversity. Ants engage in plant defense, seed dispersal, and help decomposition in the soil. These activities make both bees and ants important for ecosystem function. The research will use trait-based and landscape-scale analyses to assess how bee and ant biodiversity have changed over time, and to identify drivers of change. The project will also evaluate ways to increase public appreciation of museum natural history collections which tend to be inaccessible and undervalued. This information will also provide best practices for urban planning decisions that protect ecosystem services and create models for how educational materials can be evaluated and implemented.\r\n\r\nThis research has four objectives: (1) Determine how biodiversity of bees and ants have changed with urbanization intensity over the past 100 years, specifically with regards to whether there is a reduction in native species. Urban intensity will be evaluated using road density as a proxy. (2) Use a trait-based approach to determine how the urbanization process has affected which species persist, and (3) use machine learning and simulation models to predict how projected patterns of urbanization will affect future biodiversity patterns. Morphological traits (e.g., body size) will be measured from physical specimens, while other traits (e.g., nesting location) will be collected from literature and species descriptions. (4) Create immersive (e.g. virtual reality) and standard media experiences using the results from objectives 1-3 to illustrate how bee and ant biodiversity has changed over time, and assess the effectiveness of these experiences in increasing public opinion of and appreciation for, publicly funded museum collections. The fellow will receive training in urban ecology, social science, taxonomy, and methods including machine learning and geospatial analyses. The fellow will also be trained in science communication and directly engage with museum visitors through museum events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Most studies compare species diversity along an urbanization gradient, sampling rural and urban locations, rather than looking at how the species present in one location change through time. But few taxa, including bees, have long-term monitoring data. Bees provide the important ecosystem service of pollination and are often the most abundant and efficient pollinators in many systems. This project used bee specimen records from museum collections, online repositories, and researcher collections to fill this historical time gap to investigate how bee diversity has changed overtime in Wake Co., NC where the human population has increased over 16 times from 1900 to 2010. Specifically, this project wanted to determine if there was a trend in bee richness over time in a rapidly urbanizing area, if there are bee species no longer found in recent collections, and if certain traits were associated with susceptibility to habitat change.</p>\n<p>Museum collections can have biases in where and when specimens were collected and unknown sampling effort that can influence results. Additionally, biodiversity surveys are rarely able to census the entire community leading to imperfect detection. Therefore, multiple methods were used to account for potential sources of biases including filtering data to include only one method of bee capture and only one specimen per species per collection event. Additionally, presence/non-presence was analyzed instead of abundance, and imperfect detection accounted for. Multiple analyses were used to learn about community dynamics, such as local colonization and extinction, and to address issues of unknown sampling effort. This project discovered that there was no clear trend in species richness over time but that there are ~195 bee species that have not been collected in the past two decades from Wake Co., NC. There had also been a shift in the traits of species collected over time in this increasing urbanized landscape. For example, there was an increase in above-ground nesting bee species and a decrease in parasitic bee species. This work demonstrates that museum specimens and historical collections can fill in data gaps to investigate long-term species richness trends though sources of potential bias will need to be explored and addressed. These methods could be applied to understand how other species, or groups of species, have changed over time which is important with growing concerns about species loss. Also, understanding how traits vary over time could be helpful in predicting which species may be less vulnerable to continued urbanization.</p>\n<p>This project also studied strategies for communicating natural history and biological research to a public audience through online video media. Even small changes in how research is presented can have meaningful effects for science communication. The goal of this part of the project was to understand how altering the relationship of a spokesperson to a video research story influences audience perceptions of trust and expertise. For this, three spokesperson treatments were created: a scientist on-screen presenting their own research in first-person language, a third-party on-screen summarizing research in third-person language, and an infographic-style video with no one on-screen and no voice. The only differences between these video treatments were the presence of a person on-screen, if that person was identified as a \"Dr.\" or not, and 14 instances of changing an \"I\" statement to a \"scientists say\" statement. Each video presented a story about the discovery of a new ant species by looking at museum collections and had the same images presented.
