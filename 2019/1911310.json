 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description\r\n\r\nHouston- Louis Stokes STEM Pathways and Research Alliance\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, Texas Southern University (HBCU), Texas State University (HSI), the University of Houston (HSI), the University of Houston-Downtown (MI/HSI), and the University of Houston-Clear Lake (HSI) will form the Louis Stokes STEM Pathways and Research Alliance (H-LSAMP). The H-LSAMP program was assembled to significantly increase the number of underrepresented minority students who earn a baccalaureate degree in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, bringing our graduation numbers in line with the population we serve. In this proposal, the H-LSAMP STEM Pathways and Research Alliance proposes to fund new efforts in individual student retention and progression to baccalaureate degrees, transfer programs from community colleges, high-quality undergraduate research experiences, and seamless transitions into STEM graduate programs. \r\n\r\nOur program aims to increase the number, quality, and diversity of undergraduates successfully entering and completing graduate school as well as selecting careers in the exciting and important research areas across the STEM disciplines. Upon completion of the award period, the H-LSAMP program will have provided the opportunity for all level-one students to participate in research. Further, we project that around 50 percent of the level-one students will move on to professional or graduate school and that minority STEM retention will improve to over 75%. As a STEM Pathways and Research Alliance, we will work toward eliminating the two well-documented causes of attrition in STEM fields at the University level: financial need and academic support.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Based on Tinto's model and our robust collaborative learning community, the alliance will add individual development plans coupled with career explorations to provide scholars with sufficient knowledge and skills to provide for fulfilling employment and success in graduate school. Students are supported using best practices of tutoring, peer-led team learning, and mentored research. \r\nBroader Impacts: This LSAMP proposal has some of the most ethnically diverse research universities in the country which includes participation from high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, staff, faculty and administrators across all STEM disciplines. Building on programs to improve female representation in STEM, and with a mix of all races, this Alliance serves as a model that can be replicated at HSI, MSI, and HBCUs nationwide. The H-LSAMP program has had tremendous success in developing and graduating a quality UREP STEM workforce and projects to continue its nation leading growth during the next five years. Our program works to identify recruitment and retention methodologies that can be scaled and replicated nationally. Our program will provide new PLTL course material, summer bridge modifications to accelerate UREP STEM success, demonstrate the use of IDPs and career awareness to enhance long-term student success, and populate the countries PhD programs with quality UREP STEM future leaders.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Description\r\n\r\nHouston- Louis Stokes STEM Pathways and Research Alliance \r\n\r\nIn this proposal, Texas Southern University (HBCU), Texas State University (HSI), the University of Houston (HSI), the University of Houston-Downtown (MI/HSI), and the University of Houston-Clear Lake (HSI) will form the Louis Stokes STEM Pathways and Research Alliance (H-LSAMP).
