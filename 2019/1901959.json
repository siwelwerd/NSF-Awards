 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the lack of periodic atomic arrangements in bulk metallic glasses is responsible for multiple desirable properties such as high strength, superior elasticity, and an ability to be easily formed into virtually unlimited shapes, their disordered atomic structure and associated absence of defined shear planes also give rise to inferior room temperature ductility. As a result, the practical use of metallic glasses as structural materials is currently limited to only a few applications such as eyeglass frames, surgical tools, or golf clubs. In this award, experimental and theoretical approaches are combined to advance our knowledge of the atomic-scale processes governing the response of bulk metallic glasses to deformation. An improved understanding of microstructural damage mechanisms is a necessary pre-requisite to establish structure-property relationships that will allow custom-designed alloys to be produced with characteristics tailored to best match their intended applications. The students working on the project will have the unique opportunity to be trained in an area that combines interdisciplinary skills in micro- and nanomechanics, to perform investigations of materials at the scale of single atoms, to implement new experimental approaches, and to develop novel atomic scale molecular dynamics simulations. The research team will also engage with local schools to give lectures and demonstrations designed to encourage students to pursue careers in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nMetallic glasses accommodate plastic flow through the emergence of shear transformation zones, which are the smallest identifiable units in inhomogeneous plastic flow. If many such zones aggregate, shear bands can form that localize large shear strain inside a thin region of material. Such shear bands in metallic glasses are analogous to shear planes in crystals. Here, joint experimental and computational modeling studies are employed to investigate the initiation and growth of shear transformation zones, the shear bands they form, and the mechanical properties they control. Towards this end, nanoscale mechanical testing such as indentation and compression will be carried out on samples produced by innovative preparation methods to study how plastic flow is affected by strain rate, sample size, probing volume, and the structural properties of the material during deformation, the results of which will then be compared to computer simulations. This work seeks to develop an ability to quantitatively predict the initiation and propagation of shear bands, which is a critical step towards a mechanistic understanding of deformation and failure properties as well as identifying ductility and toughness enhancement methods for metallic glasses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The fundamental mechanisms that control the mechanical response of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) are poorly understood. Many of the gaps in our understanding are caused by: (i) lack of experimental samples with <em>reproducible properties at length scales</em> greater than a few microns; (ii) lack of samples that are suitable for characterization of nanoscale properties using indentation techniques; and (iii) there are currently no experimental techniques available to study BMGs over a wide range of length scales at high strain rates to replicate many real-life conditions and enable comparisons with computational studies. These shortcomings cause disagreements between data collected on the same alloys but produced separately, which prevents the development of accurate processing-structure-property relationships. Experimental studies funded by this award seek to reduce the above limitations. Complimentary computational studies were focused on 1) revealing atomic-scale rearrangement events that occur during deformation and whether these nonaffine rearrangements are alloy-specific; and 2) developing methods to identify and study shear transformation zones (STZs) whose temporal evolution controls the mechanical response in BMGs.</p>\n<p>This research has generated several important results. <strong><em>First,</em></strong> we have produced large arrays of micron-sized BMG pillars with ultrasmooth surfaces and structural homogeneity using thermoplastic forming (TPF) and succeeded generating nearly 'perfect' BMG samples by moving the TPF setup from ambient conditions to vacuum, which removes surface imperfections from trapped air (Figure 1). Such samples can then be used in controlled <em>small</em>-volume deformation experiments. <strong><em>Second,</em></strong> results from pillar deformation experiments indicate that when reporting the yield strength of bulk metallic glasses, it is the statistical distribution of the weakest link in the material that controls the bulk behavior. Most mechanical testing hides the distribution statistics due to a lack of structurally identical samples. Our research, however, has produced data from many pillars, thereby providing information on the statistical fluctuations. The results reveal that micropillars made under compression show either no external blemishes or experience complete failure. The detection of clear pop-ins before complete failure, however, indicates a previously unreported ability of the material to establish plastic flow without externally visible shear banding. <strong><em>Third,</em></strong> we showed that there is no strict limit on the accuracy that surface features can be replicated using BMGs, enabling the production of replicas with sub-angstrom surface roughness (Figure 2). Our publication on this topic was not only selected as a \"featured article\" by <em>APL Materials</em>, but it also earned the graduate student first author second place in APL Material's \"2021 Excellence in Research\" award. In an extension of the approach, we introduced a method for replicating atomically defined structures with BMGs that are subsequently crystallized without losing replication accuracy, which enables several new applications. <strong><em>Fourth,</em></strong> based on indentation experiments of <em>small</em> probing volumes (&lt;10<sup>3</sup> atoms) carried out on such surfaces (Figure 2), we have proposed a novel model for atomic-scale flow in BMGs (Figure 3). Complementary stiffness mapping (Fig. 4a) reveals the BMG's intrinsic heterogeneity on the nanometer scale, thereby uncovering preparation-dependent (and ultimately structure-dependent) fluctuations that are affecting metallic glass properties. <strong><em>Fifth</em></strong>, by combining results obtained through pillar compression and deformation of atomically smooth surfaces, we find that nanoscale deformation is affected by a complex interplay between multiple parameters involving deformation such as the structural state, stress levels, strain rates, relaxation pathways, and number of cycles of mechanical stimulation (Figure 4b). <strong><em>Sixth</em></strong>, we demonstrate that mechanical cycling can rejuvenate metallic glasses. Currently, annealing procedures are used to achieve this goal. A switch to mechanical cycling would save time and energy while achieving the same outcome. <strong><em>Seventh</em></strong>, we developed a novel methodology to characterize non-affine atomic motion in response to material deformation using Delaunay triangulation in 2D (and tetrahedralization in 3D). We investigated non-affine displacement fields that occur in 2D Lennard-Jones models of metallic glasses subjected to athermal, quasistatic simple shear (AQS). During AQS, the shear stress versus strain displays continuous quasi-elastic segments punctuated by rapid drops in shear stress, which correspond to atomic rearrangement events. We found that local pure shear strains of triangular elements give rise to mostly quadrupolar displacement fields, which form and dissipate both during the quasi-elastic segments and shear stress drops (Fig. 4c). In addition, we developed a spring network model that can recapitulate the force versus strain behavior of metallic glasses during uniaxial tension and showed that the mechanical response of metallic glasses is universal when we consider the heating and disspation mechanisms that occur during during strain-rate-dependent uniaxial compression (Fig. 4d).</p>\n<p>Broader impacts of the award include an improved understanding of the preparation-, size- and location-dependent mechanical properties of BMGs and advancing the structural replication of BMGs on the atomic scale, which will enable novel devices and technologies. The project also provided student and postdoc training opportunities in state-of-the-art sample preparation, mechanical characterization, imaging methods, and molecular dynamics simulations, and it supported outreach activities for the general public.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/04/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Udo&nbsp;Schwarz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1901959/1901959_10602110_1656948124469_20220702Figure2forOutcomesReportDeformationofBMGs--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1901959/1901959_10602110_1656948124469_20220702Figure2forOutcomesReportDeformationofBMGs--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2: Ilustration of the experimental approach\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1901959/1901959_10602110_1656948124469_20220702Figure2forOutcomesReportDeformationofBMGs--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2: Ilustration of the experimental approach\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2: Illustration of the experimental approach for small-volume mechanical testing: Using thermoplastic forming, atomically smooth surfaces were prepared that combined with atomic force microscopy-based nanoindentation enable atomic-scale plastic deformation experiments.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Udo D.
