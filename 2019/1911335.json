 "awd_abstract_narration": "The near-Earth environment (Geospace) is mostly organized by the Earth's magnetic field, which interacts with the solar wind (charged particles, plasma, flowing with a great speed from the Sun) and interplanetary magnetic field (extended Sun's magnetic field). Geospace is populated by plasma that mostly originates from the solar wind. Interaction of these two major players - geomagnetic field and solar wind plasma produces many electromagnetic phenomena such as beautiful ionospheric aurorae (Northern and Southern lights), natural electromagnetic radiation, field-aligned and ionospheric currents, that prominently appear and are observed in the polar areas where they are most intense. Studying these phenomena is a matter of high importance since they affect both satellite instrumentation and their communication with the ground centers. The number of satellites flying Geospace continues to grow every year.\r\n\r\nThis award will study and establish the relationship between Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR) observed by distant satellites and ground-level AKR-like signals, as well as will test current theories on how these phenomena are connected. The methodology is to operate radio receivers at South Pole during anticipated conjunctions with the Cluster satellite high-resolution wave instrument and enabling simultaneous measurements of AKR fine structure at both locations. Further observations of coincident AKR on the Japanese Geotail and Canadian ePOP satellites and at South Pole will complement these measurements. All this research can only be done from Antarctica - because AKR-like signals cannot be regularly observed in the Northern hemisphere due to man-made radio frequency interference, as well as because conjugate satellite/ground-based observations at auroral latitudes require Antarctic measurements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This radio emission has many applications because it enables detection of conditions and processes in the remote environments where the emission is generated; for example, it's been proposed to use this type or radio emission to&nbsp; detect whether distant exoplanets in other solar systems have magnetic fields. It has long been thought that AKR is beamed away from the Earth and cannot be detected at Earth's surface, but mounting evidence, some of it from Antarctica, suggests the contrary. Antarctica plays a key role in these studies because of its low level of man-made radio interference. NSF grant ANT-1911335 to Dartmouth College funded observations of AKR-like radio waves measured at South Pole Station, Antarctica. First, observations of hundreds of AKR-like radio signals during 2018-2022 determined the distribution of their intensities as a function of time-of-day and time-of-year, and as a function of frequency. Second, a series of experiments was performed in which AKR-like signals were measured at South Pole with high time and frequency resolution during times when the joint Europea/NASA Cluster satellite constellation was optimally located with respect to South Pole and made similar high-resolution measurements. Comparisons of these data revealed times when the radio emissions measured at South Pole were identical for short times or nearly identical for longer times to those escaping into outer space and measured with the Cluster satellites. While not 100% conclusive, this evidence strongly suggests a direct connection between the source of the AKR beamed into space and that leaking downward to Earth's surface. This result is important for at least two reasons. First, it implies the existence of a new radiation mechanism, and the new radiation mechanism probably occurs in a wide range of space environments besides Earth.&nbsp; Second, the AKR arriving at ground-level can be used to&nbsp; remotely sense physics processes and conditions in regions thousands of kilometers above the Earth where the emissions originate, as has been done previously using the AKR beamed into space detected with satellites. The study of AKR funded by this grant to Dartmouth College also yielded valuable information about other types of natural radio emissions, such as the discovery of flickering auroral hiss, a phenomenon resulting from interaction of the electrons causing aurora with low-frequency electromagnetic waves at 1000-3000 kilometers altitude. Similar to AKR, this discovery implies new methods of remotely sensing ionospheric conditions and processes. Another by-product of the research was detection at South Pole of AM radio signals from different regions of the world, which implies possibilities to use those signals to remotely sense the southern hemisphere ionosphere.
