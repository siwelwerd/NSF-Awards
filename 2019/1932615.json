 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to develop new methods to increase the efficiency of freight activity, thereby reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the freight sector.  There are widespread inefficiencies in the freight transport system, many due to lack of coordination across actors in the system:  railroads and trucking firms, shipping companies, cargo owners, and port operators. There is a need for a centrally coordinated freight management system that will optimize the flow of freight across the rail and road transportation networks.  These networks are very complicated:  freight and passengers share the same infrastructure; there is temporal and spatial variation in demand; there are many decision-makers affecting the system.   We use optimization and control theory and techniques combined with behavioral models to develop a centrally managed control system.  The fundamental concept is efficient freight load balancing, meaning allocating freight demand across time and space to serve the entire set of demands as efficiently as possible.  In order to accomplish optimal load balancing, we must address two questions:  1) What is the most efficient and sustainable spatio-temporal allocation of freight shipments across the road network, and 2) what incentives and pricing tools will motivate users to accept this allocation.  The second question is necessary, because a system optimization requires changes in behavior for some users relative to each user optimizing independently.\r\n\r\nOur research approach is co-Simulation, Control and Optimization with BEhavioral incentives (SCOBE).  We use simulation models as part of a closed loop optimization system where the system dynamics and user behavior are monitored and updated.  Once we allow for variation in user preferences, conventional approaches to solving the system optimization problem are inadequate.  Rather, we must take user preferences directly into account in order to determine the best combination of shipment allocations and user incentives. This project makes the following contributions:  First, it advances science by developing a method for system optimization with variation in user preferences.  Second, the resulting method will be demonstrated through the participation of at least one trucking company to evaluate its value in a real-world context.  Third, particulate emissions from heavy duty trucks are one of the largest sources of human health impacts in urbanized areas.  Increasing freight efficiency will reduce particulate and other emissions, as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Fourth, the research will be used to promote under-represented undergraduate students to pursue graduate studies, and promote under-represented high school students to pursue careers in the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Today&rsquo;s trucking system involves trucking companies and individual operators who make their decisions based on meeting their own objectives. &nbsp;Decisions by one firm creates demand that affects all others. The lack of exchange of information and cooperation among different users leads to inefficiencies and higher costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This project aims to &nbsp;reduce the negative impact of user-based decisions by developing a centralized routing system for trucks with the objective of minimizing the overall system cost rather than the individual user cost. System cost may consist of overall travel times, environmental impact and fuel costs. For such a system to work, individual truck drivers and companies must be willing to participate, and therefore the system must understand driver and firm preferences for travel time and cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;These preferences are represented in utility functions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The proposed &nbsp;system works as follows: Drivers from different companies submit their demand for origin, destination, and time windows to a central coordinator. The central coordinator uses the information from all drivers to generate optimal routes which lead to overall minimum travel time and costs. This is accomplished by balancing the truck demands across the road network and time periods. System optimization may require some drivers to deviate from their (user optimal) preferred routes.&nbsp;&nbsp;An incentive scheme is established which assures that drivers are better off participating than not. The incentive scheme is reinforced by learning driver preferences and choices with respect to travel time, cost, route familiarity etc. This feedback allows the central route optimizer to improve compliance. The incentive is a pricing system which guarantees that the individual user cost (time and money) is always less by participating than not.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The centralized truck routing system is demonstrated using data provided by a local trucking firm. The data include GPS traces from 167 trucks over a 30-day period.&nbsp;&nbsp;The firm serves the busy ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. &nbsp;We found that most drivers follow the user optimal routes for a given time period.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we apply the central routing system, we find that there is room for improvement by shifting schedules with respect to time. With central coordination that optimizes with respect to both route and time, improvements in total travel time vary from 5% to 30% depending on demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits of centralized coordination increase with the level of demand until the system reaches capacity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Current technologies make implementation of a centrally coordinated truck routing system feasible.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an opportunity to bring significant improvements in truck movements which will benefit overall transportation system performance in urban areas where the volume of trucks is relatively high. We have demonstrated the benefits of central coordination of truck routes and anticipate commercialization in the near future. Trucks have a greater impact on traffic than passenger cars because of their size, slower acceleration and deceleration, and maneuverability. Given that trucks generally operate on planned schedules and time windows it is quite possible to plan their routes and schedules to reduce their impact on traffic while also reducing their cost of operation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impact</strong></p>\r\n<p>The project generated several papers published in top journals and presented at conferences.
