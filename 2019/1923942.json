 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals interact with diverse microorganisms.  Some microbes are pathogenic, and cause disease.  Other benign microbes, like the microbiome, are part of the normal flora associated with the animal. The immune system must therefore use a nuanced detection system that discriminates between pathogenic and benign microbes. One way the immune system detects pathogenic microbes is by the presence of host cell damage and stress. This project seeks to dissect the molecular and genetic mechanism of infection that start with the conserved G-protein Coupled Receptor FSHR-1 and how this receptor activation results in oxidative stress.  For broader impacts, a portion of the experiments will be performed in the context of an undergraduate course-based research experience, immersing approximately 100 undergraduate students in authentic research projects.  This research provides training for the next generation of scientists. Students with substantial research will be co-authors on research-based publications. \r\n\r\nOne type of stress associated with infection is oxidative stress. However, a direct link between oxidative stress and infection recognition has not been established.  This is the goal of this research project. The conserved G-protein Coupled Receptor FSHR-1 is a key player in both innate immunity and the response to oxidative stress, and is a primary candidate to coordinate these two critical processes in Caenorhabditis elegans.  The experiments will establish the relationship between FSHR-1 and principal molecular components of the oxidative stress response in infected animals using genetic epistasis (Aim 1).  Multiple measures of the immune response will assess whether oxidative stress is a necessary and/or sufficient element of infection recognition (Aim 2).  Finally, novel genes that connect oxidative stress and immunity will be identified to construct a more complete framework for the integration of these processes (Aim 3).  This research project has the potential to transform understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which infection is detected using an experimentally tractable system.  Insight into the connection between immunity and oxidative stress, and FSHR-1's role therein, will not only reveal a new means for differentiating pathogenic vs. benign microbes, but will also provide valuable insights into the interaction between animals and their natural microbial milieu.  In addition, this research provides a platform that allows undergraduate researchers to perform hypothesis-based research as a means to train the next generation of scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nAnimals are exposed to multiple types of stress in their environments, including oxidative stress and infection by pathogenic microorganisms. To survive, the animal must detect and respond appropriately to the stressor. Pathogenic microorganisms can be difficult to distinguish from benign microbes because they possess much the same physical structure. One detection mechanism used by epithelial cells that are exposed to both harmful and helpful bacteria is to monitor for signs of stress and damage that accompany an infection rather than directly identify pathogens. During an infection, animal cells are exposed to oxidative stress, both as a result of pathogen attack and as part of the early response to infection. Because oxidative stress is associated with infection, we wondered whether it might be one type of stress that is monitored to activate and/or reinforce immune responses.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe Nrf transcription factor SKN-1 and the GPCR FSHR-1 have known roles in both the oxidative stress and innate immune responses. We showed that fshr-1 does not play a major role in regulating skn-1 function, suggesting that these genes act largely in parallel to each other. Although these genes and several others play a role in both processes, we showed that oxidative stress is likely not a major trigger for the innate immune response because it is neither necessary nor sufficient to activate multiple facets of immune defenses. Excitingly, we did identify a new gene, snpc-4, that also plays an important role in both the oxidative stress response and innate immunity. Further, two SNAPc-interacting proteins appear to cause the same effects, suggesting that the process of trans-splicing may have an as-yet-unexplored role in diverse stress responses.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nBroader Impacts\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMore than 120 undergraduate students have experienced authentic novel research while contributing to this project. Participation in undergraduate research is a key factor in the retention and success of students underrepresented in the sciences and is an essential preparation for all students intending to pursue laboratory-based careers in STEM fields. This project developed a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) as the laboratory component of a required genetics course, bringing research opportunities to a broad population of students. This high-impact course synergized with the scientific goals by using a crowd-sourcing approach to screen more than 1200 genes for a role in regulating oxidative stress. The CURE students collaboratively characterized promising genes, which were then investigated more intensely by a subset of students pursuing longer-term independent research projects. Notably, our most exciting discovery of this project, snpc-4, was a product of this process. By advancing our understanding of the connections between innate immunity and oxidative stress and through the education of undergraduate students, this project has provided a direct and powerful benefit to society.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JenniferRPowell\n"
