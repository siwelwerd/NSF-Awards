 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobile apps often use analytics infrastructures to gather data on app\r\nperformance and user behaviors. There are significant privacy concerns\r\nabout the collection and use of such data. Legislative efforts and\r\nsocietal demands are calling for increased transparency and\r\nwell-defined compromises between the utility of data gathering and the\r\ncorresponding loss of privacy. This project will improve the privacy\r\nof mobile app analytics by employing differential privacy, which\r\nprovides a rigorous theory and a powerful algorithmic framework for\r\nprivacy-preserving analysis.  Integration of research\r\nand education will develop the expertise of developers of mobile apps\r\nand data analyses. Recruitment of underrepresented students will\r\ncontribute to increased diversity in computing. The project will\r\nadvance the important area of user privacy, in an environment with\r\nrapidly-increasing societal and legislative demands for privacy.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will develop rigorous and quantifiable privacy\r\nmechanisms in mobile-app analytics by leveraging the theory of local\r\ndifferential privacy (LDP). The first contribution of the project will\r\nbe the design and implementation of PrivAid, a conceptual approach and\r\nrelated software tools for deploying LDP analyses in widely-used\r\ninfrastructures for mobile-app analytics. Based on this foundation,\r\nseveral algorithms targeting important software analyses will be\r\ndeveloped using novel techniques for randomization and sampling: (1)\r\nedge/path profiling in control-flow graphs; (2) analyses of heavy\r\nhitters for event profiling and graph profiling; (3) profiling under\r\ncontinuous observation. The public release of PrivAid, software\r\nanalyses, and experimental subjects will enable the development and\r\nevaluation of future LDP software analyses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
