 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hurricane Florence was an immense 2018 September storm that caused significant coastal erosion in North Carolina on the Outer Banks. Rainfall events associated with the storm caused unprecendented flooding in coastal and inland locations that impacted sediment delivery to the coastal ocean. In addition, the hurricane generated a storm surge of 2 to 3 meters. Elevated water levels combined with the tremendous and sustained wave energy caused substantial erosion to coastal islands and inlets and likely impacted sediments and the morphology of the seafloor across the continental shelf. This research project collects time-critical, ephemeral data consisting of geophysical surveys and sediment coring in the offshore and back island lagoonal parts of the Bear Island, Onslow Bay, and Bogue Banks areas. These surveys will be taken in the same location of surveys and coring done for studies in the same areas prior to the storm to understand the impacts of Florence on these environments. Goals of the collection and analysis of the new data are to assess the impact of the storm on: (1) erosion and sedimentation throughout the region; (2) changes to the sand resources (location, volume, etc.); (3) changes to the types of microfossils and sediments in the various environments and; (4) the potential for retaining and identifying this storm signal in the stratigraphic record. Understanding inner shelf and coastal processes and their response to high energy storm events like Hurricane Florence is important for accurately calculating sand volumes for beach nourishment, understanding where sand goes following such an event, and forecasting coastal erosion rates in response to sea-level rise and storm impacts. This will aid in our understanding of the resiliency of sand resources which are vital for beach nourishment in this region and all along the Outer Banks of the United States. Broader impacts of the work include graduate and undergraduate student training and the sharing of data and information with Hammocks Beach State Park personnel in North Carolina which may aid in management of the park, as well as other coastal resource managers. \r\n\r\nHurricane Florence severely impacted the coastal region of North Carolina between Cape Fear and Cape Hatteras in September of 2018 with  sustained winds of 50 to 90 mph with gusts exceeding 100 mph. It also generated significant wave heights of 8 meters with peak periods of 15 to 17 seconds in a generally microtidal area. The hurricane also caused a storm surge of 2 to 3 meters in central Onslow Bay, North Carolina that was sustained over several tidal cycles. With an average inner continental shelf depth of about 15 m in Onslow Bay, these shallow water waves possessed tremendous energy that greatly influenced erosion, sediment transport, and deposition on the inner continental shelf, the shoreface, and barrier island and inlet environments. These impacts were manifest in a location where substantial geological and geophysical pre-storm data were recently acquired. These pre-storm data will serve as a baseline for measurements collected post-Florence in the same areas. Both geophysical (multibeam bathymetric surveys and CHIRP subbottom data) and sediment coring/sampling on the inner shelf and shoreface will be collected. Comparison of the pre- and post-storm results allow assessment of (1) erosion and sedimentation in the area; (2) changes in the distribution of beach nourishment sand resources on the inner continental shelf; (3) changes to foraminiferal assemblages which are important for paleoenvironmental and paleo storm studies; (4) assessment of the potential for survival and identification of storm signals in the stratigraphic record.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver several days in mid-September 2018, Hurricane Florence impacted the coastal region of Onslow Bay, North Carolina, and the eye passed approximately 50 km south of Bear Island and Bogue Banks (Figure 1). Winds of 50 to 90 mph, with gusts exceeding 100 mph, and wave heights of 8 m were experienced along this coast for several days. A storm surge of 2 to 3 m occurred in central and northern Onslow Bay and was sustained over several tidal cycles causing substantial erosion to the coastal islands and inlets and impacting sediments and the morphology of the seafloor across the continental shelf.\n\nOur research group from the Department of Geological Sciences at East Carolina University examined the changes to coastal environments surrounding Bear Island and Bogue Banks, NC, in response to this hurricane.  We utilized coastal aerial photographs, LiDAR data (Light Detection And Ranging which provides precise topography) and various types of sonar to examine erosion and deposition of sediments on the barrier islands and offshore (the shoreface; Figure 2).  We also collected sediment samples from various environments (e.g., inlet, beaches, dunes, overwash, offshore, etc.) to determine their characteristics, and analyzed foraminifera (sand-size single celled organisms with a calcium carbonate shell).  Data collected before the storm were compared to data collected following the storm. \n\nThe objectives were to 1) assess changes to the barrier islands and the seabed and associated beach nourishment sand resources offshore of Bogue Banks, NC; 2) define and understand changes to the sediments (i.e., grain-size statistics) in barrier island subenvironments following Hurricane Florence and with continued recovery; 3) characterize changes to the types of microfossils in subenvironments following Hurricane Florence and with continued recovery.\n\nThis project is advancing the understanding of inner shelf and coastal processes, and the response to high energy storm events like Hurricane Florence.  This is important for accurately calculating sand volumes for beach nourishment, understanding where the sand goes following such an event, and forecasting sediment movement and coastal erosion rates in response to sea-level rise, fair-weather conditions and storm conditions. Characterizing erosion and deposition on the inner shelf and shoreface in response to this event has helped us in understanding of the resiliency of sand resources (explained below), which are vital for beach nourishment in this region. Identification of changes to sediments and microfossils will aid in the interpretation of stratigraphy (with wide-ranging applications) and the identification of similar deposits and associated storm events in the stratigraphic record.  This, in turn, allows scientists to understand how storm conditions change in response to changing climate conditions.\n\nThe data reveal how sand ridges (containing potential beach nourishment sand) have moved over the years and in response to the hurricane. Ridges have migrated up to 40 m toward the west, but remain viable sand resources.  In addition, net erosion occurred on the upper to middle shoreface (shallower than approximately 14 m) and net deposition occurred on the lower shoreface.  There was a net increase in sand volume of approximately 256,000 cu yds (195,726 m3).  This excess deposition on the middle to lower shoreface is likely the result of sand eroded from the upper shoreface, beach and dunes being advected and deposited offshore during the hurricane event.  Analysis of aerial photographs and LiDAR data from before and after Hurricane Florence indicate erosion of approximately 480,000 cu yds (436,000 m3) of sand.  This equates to 87 m3/m shoreline.  The surveyed area occupies a length of approximately half of the eroded shoreline region and appears to have captured approximately half of the eroded sand.  Thus, it appears much of the sand movement was in a cross-shore direction as opposed to shore-parallel. \n\nSediments and foraminifera show changes that may be recognized in the geologic record to aid in identifying past storms.  These include a general coarsening of the sediments in most environments accompanied by an increase in fossil foraminifera (derived from reworking of shelf units) relative to modern foraminifera. \n\nThis work resulted in the education and training of four students who were directly involved in field and laboratory work.  The results have also been shared with many other students in various classes at ECU (The Geology of Coastal Processes; Geophysics; Stratigraphy).  Presentations were given at one professional meeting (Geological Society of America ? Southeastern Section meeting, 2019) by the Principal Investigator and by a graduate student.  The data were used for an undergraduate senior thesis and are also being used for a graduate student M.S. thesis.  Data have also been shared with county and state personnel involved with coastal management (Carteret County Coastal Managers Office; NC Dept. of Environmental Quality ? Division of Coastal Management), as well as being archived for public review at the National Center for Environmental Information and the Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance archive.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David J Mallinson"
