 "awd_abstract_narration": "The timely detection of solar flares is of primary importance to space weather forecasting efforts that are critical to national security, the economy, infrastructure services, remote sensing, space exploration, navigation, and timing services -- as stated in the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan.  Current flare detection methods have a built-in minimum 4-minute delay in their alert issuance due to the limitations of the methods and instruments used.  However, a new flare detection method using high-sensitivity satellite data has been developed that improves flare detection time significantly.  This new data and tool allows preventative measures to take place in a timely manner to protect societal and national interests.  Furthermore, it has a significant potential to contribute to the current understanding of solar flare initiation processes -- a highly debated scientific subject.\r\n\r\nCurrently, solar flare forecasting methods primarily rely on X-ray irradiance data without any visual imagery.  The main goal of this three-year project is to take advantage of the new, high-sensitivity, real-time, low-latency data available from the GOES/Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI) instrument in order to identify not only the time of the flare occurrence, but its location as well -- a property that can influence the magnitude of the corresponding space weather effects.  Furthermore, the new tool is capable of giving over ten minutes of advance warning before detrimental space weather effects occur.  The high-sensitivity extreme ultraviolet data available to us is uniquely suitable to identify early signs of a flare development using the novel, robust and fast flare detection tool to be utilized during this project.  By analyzing the flare development process the algorithm could also gain insight into how early ultraviolet signatures are related to flare magnitudes.  It also provides a brand new insight into the deeper physics of flares and the ways in which energy is released and plasma is heated during the evolution of energetic solar eruptions.  Studying the temporal development of flares in different wavelengths allows us to better understand how the initiation happens and what different physical environments and processes lead to instabilities in flaring regions and how it relates to the magnitude of severe space weather disturbances.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
