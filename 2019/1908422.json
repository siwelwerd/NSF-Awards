They will compare the properties of these early clusters with the properties of nearby galaxy clusters in the later universe. These to catalogs of clusters will be combined with theoretical modeling of the growth of galaxy clusters in order to link early clusters to their descendant across cosmic time and to chart cluster formation and its effect on galaxy evolution. This project will also support the mentoring of undergraduates in astronomy research.\r\n\r\nThe project will use existing data from the VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey to identify protoclusters in overdensities of high-redshift (2 < z < 5) galaxies. Low redshift clusters (z ~ 1) will be identified using data from the Observations of Redshift Evolution Survey. In both surveys, clusters will be identified using a novel Monte Carlo approach to Voronoi Tessellation techniques. A magnitude-limited survey of five VUDS protoclusters using DIEMOS will increase the number of spectroscopically identified member galaxies. Theoretical modeling from the Millennium Run will connect the high-redshift protoclusters with the low-redshift clusters of the ORELSE survey.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In order to fully understand the processes that drive this accelerated evolution, it is necessary to accurately characterize galaxies residing in high-density environments at both early and late times in the history of the Universe. Our project, the Charting Cluster Construction with VUDS and ORELSE (C3VO), has achieved this goal by exploiting the combined power of two comprehensive observational surveys, VUDS and ORELSE, to link forming clusters in the early universe to their descendants in order to track cluster formation and its effect on galaxy evolution from the time that the Universe was only 1.2 billion years old to today. For this project, we have stress-tested and created comprehensive master catalogs of galaxy properties in three historic extragalactic fields - COSMOS, ECDFS, and CFHTLS-D1. In addition, using a novel, calibratable detection technique in these three fields, we have compiled the largest and most well-defined sample of forming clusters in the early Universe (referred to as protoclusters), increasing the number of known protoclusters by over 5 times. From this sample, we have studied in detail the most-massive proto-structures, finding that these systems typically consist of&nbsp;several overdense peaks comprising large-scale proto-superclusters. Based on theoretical modelling, the member protoclusters are likely to collapse into the well-formed clusters that are observed later in the history of the Universe and to eventually become the most massive clusters, like the famous Coma Cluster, that are observed today. Our work has demonstrated that these protoclusters are the sites of enormous star-formation activity, comprising a large percentage of all the star-formation in the early Universe. These percentages surpass predictions made in numerical cosmological simulations. Compared to galaxies living in lower density, more rarified environments of the early Universe, protocluster galaxies have enhanced star formation activity and accelerated build-up of the total mass contained in stars. Our results clearly indicate that high-density environments in the Universe have strong effects on the evolution of their constituent galaxies even at these early epochs. This project has provided a strong legacy for further studies of galaxy and cluster evolution by creating an enormous database of well-tested galaxy properties, as well as a statistical and well-characterized sample of protoclusters, found in the early Universe. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As part of our commitment to outreach efforts both within the collaboration institutions but also more broadly, this project has expanded by over 35% the underrepresented student base that interacts with faculty members and participates in research by supporting the Mentorship for Undergraduate Research Participants in Physical and Mathematical Sciences (MURPPS) program at UC Davis.
