 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for the conference \"Finite Geometry and Extremal Combinatorics\" which will be held at University of Delaware from August 21 to August 24, 2019. The conference will focus on finite geometry, extremal combinatorics, and their interactions with other subareas of combinatorics. Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with properties of finite structures. It is closely related to many other areas of mathematics and has many applications ranging from logic to statistical physics, from evolutionary biology to computer science, etc.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this conference is to bring together researchers from finite geometry and extremal combinatorics in one setting to discuss recent developments. It is expected that there will be considerable cross-fertilization of ideas leading to people learning new problems and new techniques from each other. The conference will feature seven invited speakers who are leading experts in the aforementioned areas of combinatorics. There also will be 18 contributed talks. Particular efforts will be made by the PI and the co-PIs to encourage junior and/or female researchers to attend  and speak at this conference. Further details about the conference can be found at the conference website https://www.mathsci.udel.edu/fgec19\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
