 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant aims to obtain new knowledge regarding the multiphysics of a novel self-operated mechanical shock switch system. The mechanism merges two transducers, one which converts mechanical shock to voltage and another which converts voltage to motion to open a micro-switch. The result is a self-operated sensor directly operated by mechanical shock when the shock goes beyond a threshold. Currently, shock sensors such as those in air-bag deployment devices need a processing unit to engage the device, which requires a complicated control system having risks of software and component failures. The system eliminates the need for signal processing units by synergistically connecting two transducers that overcome the limitations of each system. There is a gap in the knowledge of several key aspects of each transducer that this project will address. The system has promising applications in earthquake detection systems that need to trigger an immediate response to significant seismic activity such as shutting off power lines and sounding alarms. Wider applications include safety switches in the automotive industry and shipment monitors. To familiarize a broad range of students with transducers, educational activities will be undertaken that include hands-on experiences for local elementary schools and structured research projects for undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to provide a fundamental understanding of the underlying multiphysics from the integration of triboelectric generators and levitation actuators. These systems have numerous advantages for energy transduction and electrostatic actuation, respectively. However, each mechanism has drawbacks that have not been adequately addressed and cause major limitations in various applications: triboelectric generators produce high voltages (~50-70 V) making their use in vibration energy harvesting very difficult and electrostatic levitation devices require high voltages to operate. Merging the two systems overcomes the limitations of each system. Despite much research on triboelectric materials, the coupled dynamic characteristics of triboelectric transducers and electrostatic actuators are unknown. The combined system contains mechanical and electrical components causing a sophisticated exchange of the energies between them that affects their normal behavior. This project will delineate the nonlinear interactions of the two systems using mathematical models, prototype fabrication and experimental verification. A threshold shock micro-switch will be presented that autonomously operates from mechanical shock to validate the understanding of the underlying physical phenomenon affecting these devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
