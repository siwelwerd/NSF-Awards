 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrogen (H2) is one of the most abundant trace gases in the atmosphere, with a mean level of 500 ppb and an atmospheric lifetime of about two years. Hydrogen has an impact on both air quality and climate, due to its role as a precursor for tropospheric ozone and stratospheric water vapor. Projections indicate that a future \"hydrogen economy\" would increase hydrogen emissions.  Understanding of the atmospheric hydrogen budget is largely based on a 30-year record of surface air measurements, but there are no long-term records with which to assess either: 1) the influence of climate change on atmospheric hydrogen, or 2) the extent to which humans have impacted the hydrogen budget. Polar ice core records of hydrogen will advance our understanding of the atmospheric hydrogen cycle and provide a stronger basis for projecting future changes to atmospheric levels of hydrogen and their impacts. \r\n\r\nThe research will involve laboratory work to enable the collection and analysis of hydrogen in polar ice cores. Hydrogen is a highly diffusive molecule and, unlike most other atmospheric gases, diffusion of hydrogen in ice is so rapid that ice samples must be stored in impermeable containers immediately upon drilling and recovery. This project will: 1) construct a laboratory system for extracting and analyzing hydrogen in polar ice, 2) develop and test materials and construction designs for vessels to store ice core samples in the field, and 3) test the method on samples of opportunity previously stored in the field. The goal of this project is a proven, cost-effective design for storage flasks to be fabricated for use on future polar ice coring projects. This project will support the dissertation research of a graduate student in the UC Irvine Department of Earth System Science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHydrogen (H2) is one of the most abundant trace gases in the atmosphere.  Atmospheric levels of H2 are likely to change in the future as a consequence of climate change and increasing utilization as an energy source.  Unlike other climate-active trace gases, ice core records of past atmospheric H2 have not been developed.  This is largely because H2 rapidly permeates through ice and exchanges with the modern atmosphere.  In this study, we investigated the feasibility of developing ice core records for the reconstruction of paleoatmospheric H2 on millenial time scales.\n\nWe investigated how rapid permeation of H2 affects how it is incorporated into polar ice sheets.   In order to reduce the uncertainty physical properties of H2, we conducted laboratory experiments to measure solubility and diffusivity of H2 in ice at conditions relevant to polar ice sheets.  We then modified an existing firn air model to simulate the behavior of H2 during bubble close-off in the ice sheet.  We used this model to interpret previously unpublished measurements of H2 in Antarctic firn air.  This study produced the first reconstruction of southern hemispheric atmospheric H2 over the past century, showing a 70% increase in atmospheric levels due largely to industrialization. \n\nThe firn air measurements and models demonstrate that a record of paleoatmospheric H2 is preserved in the Antarctic ice sheet.  We carried out lab and field studies to test stainless steel flasks for storing ice core samples in the field in order to preserve the entrapped H2.  This effort was not successful, due to slow permeation of H2 from within the steel.  Analysis of H2 in ice cores will therefore require extraction of the entrapped gases from ice core samples in the field shortly after drilling. \n\nThe project was successful in 1) demonstrating that paleoatmospheric H2 signals are likely preserved in the ice sheet, 2) defining the analytical requirements for collecting and analyzing those signals, and 3) developing the modeling tools needed to interpret future ice core measurements.     \n\nIn terms of broader impacts, the project formed the basis of a PhD dissertation in Earth System Science and provided hands-on research experiences for first generation undergraduates enrolled in the Earth System Science program at the University of California, Irvine, a minority-serving institutionl.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/17/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric S Saltzman"
