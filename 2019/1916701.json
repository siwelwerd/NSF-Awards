 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Anna Marie Prentiss, of the University of Montana, along with colleagues from the United States, Canada, and England will engage in research into the development of social inequality in village scale hunter-gatherer societies.   The origins of inequality in ancient societies is a central concern in anthropological archaeology with significant implications for wider understanding of inequality in today's world.   Previous research has documented conditions under which persistent institutionalized inequalities are likely to develop.  These include the presence of defensible subsistence resources and the possibility for inter-generational transmission of wealth, access to wealth, and rights to wealth.  Debate continues regarding the historical processes that give rise to material inequality with some reseachers asserting inequality to be an inevitable outcome of inherent human striving for personal economic and reproductive success under conditions of resource abundance versus others who argue that inequality is an unintended byproduct of competitive conditions during periods of resource shortfall.  Archaeology is poised to offer significant contributions to these discussions given the ability to reconstruct social evolutionary process over lengthy time spans.  The research is designed to facilitate extensive public outreach regarding indigenous culture and history along with STEM training opportunities for college students.    \r\n\r\nDr. Prentiss and her research team will examine the origins of material wealth-based inequality at the Bridge River village in the Middle Fraser Canyon of interior British Columbia.  The Bridge River site is an ideal place to study the evolution of inequality given the excellent record of human occupation spanning the past 2000 years.  This archaeological excavation project is designed to develop fine-grained tests of alternative hypotheses concerning variation in the integrated roles of demographic change, subsistence intensification, storage variability, social networking, and large scale cooking and food-sharing (\"feasting\") events associated with the origins of inequality.   The interdisciplinary research team sets a new standard for excavation and laboratory study of prehistoric cooking features in Northwestern North America with analytical approaches including sediment micromorphology, ancient DNA analysis, plant tissue identification from carbonized remains, sediment geochemistry, and advanced approaches to stone artifact and animal bone studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These models were tested with data derived from new excavations at the deeply stratified Housepit 54, Bridge River site, British Columbia. This context is particularly advantageous for such research as its 15 anthropogenic floors accumulated on a generational basis between ca. 1100 and 1460 years ago during which social relations in the house and village shifted from largely egalitarian to non-egalitarian.

Thus, we may conclude that each likely represents some form of specialized large-scale food-related ritual event. While lab studies continue, results to date indicate that large scale cooking events were infrequent and associated with very particular village-wide processes. The IIh cooking event came at a time when newly growing populations were reviving the Bridge River village after near-abandonment. The IIe event occurred at time of population packing and altered social relations. Given these outcomes it appears that large-scale food-related rituals may only have taken place when there was a need to cook and likely, share special food perhaps as a demonstration of household prowess during challenging demographic times. Thus, in light of these results, the gradual ritual intensification hypothesis (1) is not a good fit, while the short-lived demographic stress model (2) is more likely. Broader impacts of the project included field and lab research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Montana and the Statimc Nation. Results were incorporated into cultural heritage planning by the Bridge River Indian Band (Xwsten). The Housepit 54 outcomes will be important to future heritage tourism and community education efforts. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/08/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AnnaMPrentiss\n"
