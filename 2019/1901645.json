 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interactions between tectonic plates at subduction zones are responsible for generating the world's largest known earthquakes (magnitudes 8+) as well as slow-slip events (SSEs). SSEs may take place over days to years, and are not felt by people. What controls the occurrence of SSEs and how they are related to large subduction zone earthquakes is not known. At the subduction zone along the east coast of New Zealand SSEs occur every 1-2 years and many studies have focused on this region to get a better understanding of SSEs.  A 3-dimensional seismic data set has been collected in a region of SSEs along the New Zealand margin and this project will process these data to understand the fault systems and fluid flow systems in the region and the impact of these systems on SSEs. The results will aid in the assessment of earthquake and tsunami hazards at subduction zones.  The project supports the training of two early career scientists and a graduate student.\r\n\r\nSlow-slip events (SSEs) involve transient aseismic slips on a fault that last days to years. SSEs have been observed in a number of subduction zones worldwide, yet the physical mechanisms that control this type of slip remain poorly understood. At the Hikurangi margin offshore the east coast of New Zealand, well documented SSEs recur every 1-2 years at the shallow portion (~2-15 km depth) of the subduction megathrust.  This provides an ideal opportunity to examine the structural and hydrogeological conditions that contribute to the generation of SSEs through detailed seismic imaging and seismic attribute measurements. A team of scientists acquired a 3-D seismic volume within a 14.7 x 60 km survey area on the northern Hikurangi margin. This 3-D dataset, with complete coverage and excellent quality, shows great potential to reveal the conditions along the plate interface and the development of these conditions. The 3-D volume will be processed with state-of-the-art 3-D pre-stack time and depth migration to image the highest possible level of structural detail while preserving reflection characteristics. The data will be analyzed and interpreted to investigate fluid flow and tectonic development of the margin.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Subduction zones are settings where one of Earth&rsquo;s crustal plates slips beneath an overlying plate and back into the mantle. These settings generate the world&rsquo;s largest and most destructive earthquakes and tsunamis, and ~90% of all energy from earthquakes is released in these settings. However, not all subduction zones generate large amounts of strain energy and slip can occur as an aseismic creep process along the plate interface fault zone that allows many subduction zones to have few earthquakes or have only small magnitude events. Some subduction zones such as the Hikurangi margin along the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand, accommodate plate slipping through slow slip earthquakes (SSE). SSEs are earthquakes that release large strains by slipping aseismically over a period of weeks rather than the few seconds of slipping that occurs with regular earthquakes. Understanding the controlling factors and causes for this range of slipping behaviors has been a major science goal in recent years because it is critical to understanding seismic hazards from subduction zones around the world.</p>\r\n<p>The Hikurnagi margin has well-documented SSEs that are accessible for study. Here SSEs repeat ~ 4 years and are particularly shallow (&lt; 10 km depth), which makes them reasonably accessible with geophysical tools and particularly well suited for studies of slow slip behavior. SSEs along the Hikurangi margin have been linked to a wide range of causes that include, subducting basement roughness, sediment lithologies, pore fluid pressures along the subduction thrust fault between the plates, and many more factors may also be important. The 3D seismic imaging study of the Hikurangi subduction zone that we conducted for this project (Figure 1) was designed to examine factors controlling slip behavior and reveal clues to how and why SSEs occur.</p>\r\n<p>Two important outcomes from this study emerged as factors influencing slip behavior along the plate-boundary fault within our Northern Hikurangi study area. First, we show how subducting basement roughness in the form of seamounts on the subducting plate interact with the upper plate and lead to conditions that are conducive to slow slip. Our 3D survey captured a modest sized seamount (~ 2 km high and 10 km in diameter) in the process of subducting ~ 5 km beneath the upper plate, and provided the best look at the mechanics of seamount collision to date (Figure 2). Three-dimensional seismic images and seismic velocities measured from our seismic survey provided evidence for large quantities of fluid-rich sediments being carried down into the subduction zone in the wake of the seamount. The high fluid content overwhelms the normal drainage and enhances fluid content and potentially elevates fluid pressures in the wake of the seamount. We found evidence that this process has happened from previous, larger seamount collisions, which may be typical for this margin, and consequently high fluid content and associated elevated fluid pressures may be a characteristic of this margin. The additional fluid pressure is thought to enhance conditions for SSEs and is likely a controlling factor on slip behavior. These results were published in <em>Nature Geoscience</em> in 2023.</p>\r\n<p>The second primary result is that our 3D seismic velocity measurements within the uppermost two km of the subducting plate, show that it has an unusually large quantity of water within it. This water is released into the overlying plate-boundary fault during subduction, and likely modulates fluid pressures and contributes to varying frictional properties of the fault. High fluid pressures are thought to be a large contributing factor to conditions conducive to SSEs along this margin, and these results show how that can occur here. These results were published in <em>Science Advances</em> in 2023.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to these results on slip behavior, this project found significant quantities of methane hydrates and was able to map its distribution. We found that there has been recent melting, reforming and potential gas release due to recent changes in pressure and temperature conditions beneath the seafloor along this margin. These observations are important for understanding the behavior of methane hydrates in marine settings all around the world and the potential for this powerful greenhouse gas to be released into the atmosphere.
