This means  going beyond counting textbook operations, and instead investigating the time required on a parallel machine with realistic limits on  communication, so as to obtain the ultimate implementation efficiency on  current and future chips. \r\n \r\nMajor project activities include the following: 1. Fast constant-time  implementations of fundamental arithmetic operations such as integer  multiplication, Euclid's algorithm, and modular inversion. 2. A scalable parallelized implementation of the LLL lattice-basis-reduction algorithm for large-rank lattices. 3. Improvements to algorithms for finding   shorter vectors in lattices, including sieving, enumeration, and  multiplicative techniques from algebraic number theory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
