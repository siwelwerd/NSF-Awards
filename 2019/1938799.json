 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a 2016 study entitled \"The Demographics of Innovation in the United States\", the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) found that only 12% of U.S. innovators are women, and only 8% are members of U.S. minority groups (including Asians, African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and other ethnicities).  As demographic characteristics of the U.S. population change, a key question is, \"How can the U.S. remain competitive without engaging the talents and abilities of all of its citizens?\" To address this question, this EAGER proposal will conduct exploratory research focusing on integrating research-based strategies and best practices to achieve diversity and inclusion in the NSF I-Corps program, which prepares scientists and engineers to transition their research out of universities with the goal of commercialization. By funding the exploratory research and pilot initiative outlined in this EAGER proposal, the project will support efforts to identify and integrate effective strategies for diversity and inclusion into the national I-Corps innovation network.\r\n\r\nIn year one, the team will collect qualitative data from various stakeholders to understand the current practices of the NSF I-Corps program and compare these practices to the most current academic research and reports on inclusive innovation. As a result, a research paper will be written to describe best practices for Inclusive Innovation in technology entrepreneurship. During the 2nd quarter of 2020, this research will be presented at a stakeholders meeting such that working groups can leverage the information to develop new strategies for increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities in the NSF I-Corps program. At this stakeholders meeting, several new partnerships will be facilitated between the entrepreneurship organization and advocacy groups that promote diversity in tech entrepreneurship and the I-Corps Site and Nodes. In year 2, the research team will work with two I-Corps Sites to test a preliminary model for inclusive innovation developed by the stakeholder organizations. This pilot initiative will demonstrate and evaluate new approaches to achieving diversity goals in technology entrepreneurship/commercialization. The findings from this research have the potential to enhance and transform the participation in the I-Corps program at all levels, and complement NSF efforts to broaden participation of women and underrepresented minorities in science/technology entrepreneurship towards the overall effort to enhance and maintain the global competitiveness of America's innovation economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objective for this EAGER supported research project was to assess the current I-Corps program in terms of diversity, equity, and inclusive innovation (D,E, &amp;I).  We interacted with more than 70 faculty innovators, program managers and past-participants in the I-Corps program through this research includng and a June 2021 I-Corps Stakeholers meeting.  Findings from this research identified challenges in several aspects of the I-Corps program.  These challenges permeate all aspects of the I-Corps program and present significant obstacles to creating a welcoming and supportive environment that is inclusive of women and Under-Represented Minorities (URMs). We identified the following findings from the interviewing and interacting with key stakeholders:  1) Diversity initiatives are happening in several sites and nodes but they are not well-diffused and/or disseminated. 2)  There is no clearinghouse for commonly used materials by the teaching teams.  3) Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is deliberate/intentional.

These recommendations to NSF have the potential to make I-Corps more relevant and responsive to the emerging community of diverse innovators.  The six recommendations from the final report are below.  \n\nEstablish common metrics for measuring diversity, equity and inclusion;\nAudit I-Corps nodes/hubs and sites for diversity practices and outcomes;\nEncourage diverse teaching teams;\nDevelop instructor team training that address bias and helps instructors develop inclusive teaching practices;\nCultivate partnerships and collaborations that will lead to more diverse participants (i.e. NSF ADVANCE, GEM i4);\nDiffuse best practices throughout the national innovation network (NIN).\n\n\nThe executive summary of this report can be downloaded by following this link.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/22/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey A Robinson"
