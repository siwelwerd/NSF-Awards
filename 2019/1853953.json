 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will send 3 cohorts of 5 students per year for 10 weeks each to conduct research at the University of Bamberg, Germany.  The University of Bamberg operates a Smart City Living Laboratory throughout the university and the city of Bamberg, Germany that is able to collect information such as noise levels, CO2 levels, and the number of people in a particular area from sensors throughout the city.  Smart cities collect information and process it to help decision makers make better decisions with a fuller understanding of the complex interactions of people and services in a city.  Some of the information comes from sources that are considered trustworthy such as CCTV cameras deployed by city workers; however, these trustworthy sources are often expensive to set up and maintain.  Crowd sourcing the information provides a cheaper and often more efficient way of obtaining information; however, since people can lie or malicious software could lie on their behalf, this information is significantly less trustworthy.  \r\nOur research examines the interactions between all of the entities in such a smart city environment and develops methods for utilizing crowd sourced information while protecting the city from malicious users and protects users from people who might spy on them through their data.  Researchers will be implementing and testing their work in the Living Lab Bamberg in Germany to validate the effectiveness of our security systems.  It is expected that this work will result in safer, more intelligent smart cities with the potential to improve energy efficiency, communication, transportation, and public health.\r\n\r\nThis project will address several scientific challenges in the security and privacy of smart cities. The site at the University of Bamberg was chosen due to the smart city living laboratory that the university operates on both the campus and city.  The researchers will address the following three scientific challenges:  \r\ni) Utilization of data from untrusted sources is critical because many of the data sources in a smart city are the smart phones of users who can intentionally manipulate data or who might have malware on their phone that is strategically manipulating data.  Students will build defense mechanisms using a combination of game theory and machine learning. \r\nii) Privacy of users is critical to the adoption of crowd sensing for use in a smart city and to prevent the abuse of the system by users and administrators alike.  Students will build privacy-enhancing technologies that use realistically generated cover traffic to obfuscate user data and cyber-physical correlation to enable privacy-preserving audits of the data collected by the city. \r\niii)   Secure incentives help to protect the deployers of tasks from malicious users that are seeking to optimize their gain without contributing to the system.  To ensure that malicious users do not exploit the incentive system, students will create spatio-temporal models of context information that detect if a user was actually at the location at the time they reported they were when contributing information.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
