 "awd_abstract_narration": "The especially intense updrafts in supercell thunderstorms facilitate the production of large hail, tornadoes, extreme rainfall rates, and prolific lightning. As a result of their great impacts on society, considerable research efforts are warranted to better understand and predict the environmental factors that contribute to the vertical accelerations that give way to supercells' impressive updrafts. This collaborative research effort will utilize numerous, innovative high-resolution numerical modeling experiments coupled with observational datasets in order to understand the forcing for supercell updrafts at various heights over a range of realistic near-storm environments. Thus, this work has tangible broader impacts to society through its potential to improve understanding and forecasting of supercell thunderstorms and their related hazards as well as through training of a new generation of scientists. \r\n\r\nMotivated by a current lack of comprehensive understanding in these areas, this research will investigate the following scientific questions: (1) How do low-level stability, low-level shear, and low-level storm-relative flow conspire to determine a storm's effective inflow layer? (2) How do concurrent changes in low-level stability and shear, as occurs during the evening transition, influence the ratio of air ingested from different layers and the vertical profiles of buoyant and dynamic pressure accelerations in the lower portion of a supercell updraft? (3) How might the connection between storm-relative flow and updraft width influence an updraft's profile of buoyant and dynamic vertical accelerations?  These questions will be answered using numerical simulations with a range of realism from highly idealized to real-data simulations of observed storms, wherein quantities such as the effective inflow layer, updraft forcing, and entrainment will be compared and verified via dual-Doppler radar observations when available.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis goal of this project, along with the companion collaborative grant by PI John Peters at Penn State University, was to understand that environmental factors that control supercell thunderstorm updraft strength during the transition from unstable afternoon environments to more stable nocturnal environments that often feature stronger vertical wind shear (the so-called evening transition). These goals were achieved using a mix of observational analysis and idealized numerical simulations. The main outcomes of the project were as follows:\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\n\nThis project resulted in or contributed towards nine peer-reviewed journal article publications and eight conference presentations. The main scientific findings reported in these publications/presentations are:\r\n\n\n- The main mechanism by which changes in wind speed and direction with height (i.e., vertical wind shear) strengthen supercell thunderstorm updraft is through increasing the low-level inflow to these storms which widens them, protecting the positively buoyant updraft air from dilution through mixing with less buoyant environmental air. Consequently, supercell updrafts can realize a greater amount of the potential energy in their environments and become stronger.\r\n\n\n- An existing method for approximating the layer of the storm environment that feeds thunderstorms (known as the effective inflow layer) is a reasonably good prediction as confirmed by simulations, particularly for supercell thunderstorms, an even as the lower levels of the environment stabilize at night.\r\n\n\n- In the Southeastern United States (US), tornadoes often occur in varied storm modes and environments that have less instability. Our work showed that the evening transition leads to different environmental evolution in the Southeast US compared to other regions, particularly when the pre-sunset environment has limited instability. In these cases, instability often increases after dark, promoting a continued risk for tornadoes.\r\n\n\n- We developed a theoretical model that was supported by simulation results for deep convection initiation and subsequent updraft properties that accounts for the effects of vertical wind shear, initial storm width, and environmental relative humidity.\r\n\n\n- During the evening transition in high-shear, low-CAPE environments, shallow updrafts tend to increase in depth and width in cases where the environment destabilizes after dark, which leads to more deviant storm motions, which have the positive feedback of promoting wider, stronger updrafts. In more typical high-shear, high-CAPE environments, supercell updrafts are typically more robust to begin with, but only slightly weaken at low-levels during the evening transition, so long as there is adequate increase in the low-level shear.\r\n\n\n- Supercell updraft width and strength is more closely tied to low-level storm-relative flow strength, but the rotational characteristics of supercell mesocyclones are more dependent on the horizontal streamwise vorticity in the environment.\r\n\n\n- The strongest environmental predictor of whether a supercell will persist after sunset is lower convective inhibition in the near storm environment rather than instability or vertical wind shear.\r\n\n\n- Most nocturnal supercell tornadoes in the southern great plains occur in storms that remain surface based after sunset and they tend to have much less convective inhibition, lower LCLs, and stronger low-level shear over a very shallow layer than non-tornadic nocturnal storms.\r\n\n\n- The environmental differences between supercells that produce tornadoes at any point in their lifetime versus supercells that never produce tornadoes are greater than the environmental differences during the portion of a tornadic supercells lifetime that it is actively producing a tornado versus the times it is not.\r\n\n\n- Dry air in the free troposphere leads to weaker supercell updrafts and precipitation production than more moist free troposphere. Supercell updrafts (for the same amount of shear and instability) are more sensitive to free tropospheric relative humidity than boundary layer relative humidity.\r\n\n\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\n\nThis project involved 3 graduate students and two undergraduate students. This contributed to two masters degrees and one PhD degree. All of the students were trained in data analysis techniques and written and oral scientific communication skills. Findings from this work were incorporated in undergraduate and graduate courses taught by PI Nowotarski.\r\n\n\nIn terms of the societal benefit of improved thunderstorm hazard prediction, our project findings had the following outcomes relevant to forecasters. First, we developed a new formula for maximum updraft intensity in supercells from the near-storm environment that will help forecasters predict storm intensity and potential for hazards like hail, lightning, and tornadoes. Secondly, we verified the skill of the effective inflow layer, adding confidence to forecasting metrics that rely on it. Thirdly, improved versions of the significant tornado parameter (STP) were developed for high-shear, low-CAPE environments for both supercells and linear convective mode tornadoes that can be used by forecasters in more specific scenarios than the more general STP. Finally, our identification of the environmental parameters most associated with nocturnal supercell maintenance and nocturnal supercell tornadoes will likely be useful to forecasting and warning efforts at a time when society is most vulnerable to injury/death from tornadoes due to poor visibility or lack of awareness.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ChristopherJNowotarski\n"
