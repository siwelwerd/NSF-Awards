 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a research project that studies how changing social networks influence public belief about science; it will focus specifically on how false beliefs can persist and spread even in evidence-rich environments, and how these beliefs in turn feed back into collective decision-making through democratic institutions. The results of this project will provide a better understanding of the drivers that shape public belief about matters of scientific facts and how those influences interact with democratic institutions. The results will be relevant to academics across the social sciences and humanities, and they will have immediate social significance particularly to policy makers, including those working in the government and those shaping social media sites. The PIs also have plans to develop an intervention that may serve to improve public uptake of data through social media, to disseminate their results to general audiences, and to develop new programs to mentor graduate and undergraduate students on producing their own public philosophy. In addition, they will develop an integrative teaching plan that incorporates their research outcomes into teaching and mentoring at the undergraduate and graduate levels, with an emphasis on mentoring members of underrepresented minorities in philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will explore a cluster of topics related to the social dynamics of false belief and the public understanding of science in democratic societies. The PIs will explore these issues from the perspectives of philosophy of science and social epistemology, drawing on formal tools developed by economists, biologists, and philosophers, including epistemic network models and agent-based modeling techniques. They will use these methods to address several questions concerning how journalistic practices bear on public understanding of science, the role of influencers (such as propagandists from foreign governments, domestic political groups, and industry) in shaping the public understanding of science, how social dynamics interact with individual cognitive biases to shape belief and consensus, and how consensus over scientific belief emerge among the public and policy makers. The results of this research will be published in professional journals in philosophy of science and in social epistemology. The project dovetails with related projects from other disciplines including  economics, political science, psychology, and sociology; the results of this project should be of substantial interest to researchers in those disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe major goals of this project involved using computational modeling methods to study the dynamics of belief, especially scientific belief, in human societies, and to consider implications for the functioning of democratic societies. We explored these issues from the perspectives of philosophy of science and social epistemology, drawing on formal tools developed by economists, psychologists, biologists, and philosophers, including epistemic network models, experimental paradigms, and agent-based modeling techniques. One key activity was to broaden the toolbox for modeling scientific communities in philosophy of science by drawing on additional modeling frameworks from biology, economics, mathematical sociology, and other disciplines. Ultimately, the project aimed to understand interactions between public understanding of science, and democratic function. As such we investigated how beliefs formed through imperfect social mechanisms, and influenced by factors like media and propaganda, can support effective policy making. The project began before the COVID-19 pandemic, but many of the project themes became even more important as both scientists and the general public struggled to understand the new virus and to craft sound policies around its containment, and the team pivoted to focus on problems particularly relevant during that period.\n\n\nAmong the most significant findings were a new understanding of why retracted scientific articles continue to be influential long after they have been shown to be unreliable. At issue is that retractions can only spread within a social network that has already learned of the information being retracted, and thus there is always a leading edge of people who are aware of the articles reported findings, but do not yet know of the retraction, which means that the articles continue to spread even as the retraction tries to catch up. This finding proved especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic, when scientists understanding of COVID was changing very rapidly and many scientific articles were produced and then found to be flawed. Another key finding, based on experimental work inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, was that judgements of exposure risk for COVID depended on subjects judgment of the moral valence of the action leading to the possible exposure. Immoral acts were expected to carry more exposure risk. Yet another key finding concerned how standard practices in science curation (e.g., journalism or social media) lead to systematically inaccurate public belief. The team showed that when this phenomenon interacts with confirmation bias, distortative journalistic practices can lead to polarization. Finally, team members used modeling methods from economics to study aspects of epistemic marginalization, widely discussed in feminist epistemology, that have not previously been studied using formal methods. This work showed a novel sense in which marginalized epistemic agents could learn faster and more effectively than non-marginalized agentsand also how similar effects could benefit industrial scientists over publicly-supported ones.\n\n\nThis is just a sample of the most significant project outcomes. The team produced a substantial body of work, including, one accepted book manuscript, Modeling Scientific Communities, by co-PI Cailin OConnor, for Cambridge University Press; eight published or accepted peer-reviewed journal articles; and two published or accepted peer-reviewed book chapters. In addition, five manuscripts are currently under review at peer-reviewed journals; one more is complete and pending submission presently; and several others are in the final stages of preparation, for a total of 16 research papers and one book completed before the end of the project and several ongoing projects that were started with project support. The research findings were also communicated in other ways. Well over 100 talks were delivered on project-related material, including conference presentations, public lectures, and colloquia.\n\n\nIn addition to these research goals and outputs, we aimed to promote public engagement from philosophers of science, especially about topics related to misinformation and democratic functioning; and to support diverse graduate education in philosophy of science using a model of graduate education drawing on traditional approaches in the sciences and in the humanities. The project had a public outreach component, resulting in three public facing articles, one in Boston Review and two in Nautilus. Project results were discussed on several podcasts, often including interviews with co-PIs, and were covered in other media, such as Science News and Reason.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/14/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JamesWeatherall\n"
