 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nHot cracking occurs during welding (while the weld is still very hot) either during or right after solidification of the weld pool. It is essential to avoid cracking in welds of stainless steels because various grades of stainless steels are commercially available and widely used in power and chemical plants. The project seeks to address two fundamental issues: 1) why some grades of stainless steels resist hot cracking significantly better than some other grades, and 2) how the microscopic features inside the weld (called the microstructure) resist hot cracking at elevated temperatures during welding. The project is expected to advance the understanding of hot cracking in welds of stainless steels, which is currently based on the room-temperature microstructure that does not even exist at elevated temperatures during welding to resist hot cracking. The experimental results from the project can be expected to guide the search for stainless-steel filler metals that better resist hot cracking, help understand hot cracking in additive manufacturing of stainless steels and serve as excellent new materials for teaching the metallurgy of stainless steels. The project seeks to hire a Hispanic graduate student.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe project deals with hot cracking in arc welds of stainless steels, which are essentially Fe-Cr-Ni alloys. The goal is to establish the fundamental understanding of solidification cracking and ductility-dip cracking in welds of stainless steels. It is proposed that good resistance to solidification cracking (which occurs along boundaries between dendrites growing in the mushy zone behind the weld pool) is caused by the formation of a significant amount of the interdendritic phase early during solidification to bond the dendrites together. It is also proposed that good resistance to ductility-dip cracking (which occurs along boundaries between fully-grown dendrites in the region of the fusion zone closely behind the mushy zone) is caused by the absence of naked columnar dendrites that provide long straight paths for easy crack initiation and propagation. The mechanisms will be verified by: 1. quenching various grades of stainless steels with liquid Wood's metal (70oC) during welding to freeze-in the elevated-temperature microstructure in and around the mushy zone, 2. examining the extents of cracking induced by quenching and relating them to the elevated-temperature microstructure, and 3. conducting solidification cracking tests on the stainless steels. The proposed study on stainless steels will be applied to high-entropy alloys FeCrNiCoCux (which also contain Fe, Cr and Ni like stainless steels) to better understand their weldability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Solidification cracking can occur in the mushy zone, liquation cracking in the partially melted zone, and ductility-dip cracking (DDC) in the region of the fusion zone immediately behind the mushy zone, where the ductility can be low. Solidification and liquation cracking occur in the semisolid state, and DDC in the solid state. All three occur along the grain boundary, i.e., intergranular cracking. The significant outcomes are as follows.</p>\n<p>1. A simple test for the susceptibility to solidification cracking developed by the PI (Fig. 2), called the Transverse-Motion Weldability (TMW) test, was used to access various stainless steels, including 304, 310 and 316 (austenitic), 430 (ferritic), and 2205 (duplex). The relative susceptibility assessed was consistent with data reported by previous investigators. For example, 304 is much more susceptible than 310 (Fig. 2). The comparison among different stainless steels is more direct when they are all assessed by the same test method.</p>\n<p>2. The solidification microstructure evolution of stainless steels was revealed by quenching with liquid Wood's metal during welding. A few cubic centimeters of liquid Wood's metal were poured onto the weld pool and its surrounding area during welding.</p>\n<p>3. The conventional theory of solidification cracking accepted worldwide for decades was disapproved. It suggested skeletal/lacy delta-ferrite resists both solidification cracking in the mushy zone and DDC in the region of the fusion zone immediately behind the mushy zone. Quenching during welding, however, showed skeletal/lacy delta-ferrite does not even exist in either region in 304 to resist any cracking (Fig. 3a). Instead, it exists far behind the mushy zone (Fig. 3b).</p>\n<p>4. A new theory was proposed. If the primary solidification phase is delta-ferrite (bcc), such as the delta-ferrite dendrites in 304 (Fig. 4a), fast back diffusion (Fig. 4b) helps deplete the intergranular liquid earlier and so dendrites bond to each other earlier to better resist cracking (Fig.3a). If the primary solidification phase is gamma-austenite (fcc), such as the gamma-austenite dendrites in 310 (Fig. 4a), diffusion is much slower (Fig. 4b). So, liquid films persist between gamma-austenite dendrites (Fig. 3c) to continue to weaken bonding between grains.</p>\n<p>5. In 304 the ferrite-to-austenite phase transformation immediately after solidification forms gamma-austenite along the boundaries of delta-ferrite dendrites (Fig. 3a). This resists DDC along the grain boundaries, not the skeletal/lacy delta-ferrite as the conventional theory suggested. 310 forms little delta-ferrite along the boundaries of gamma-austenite grains (Fig. 3c) to resist DDC along grain boundaries, resulting in much DDC (Fig. 5). &nbsp;Grain-boundary migration occurs and makes the grain boundaries long and straight, easy for DDC to propagate (Fig. 5a and c).</p>\n<p>6. The Cu content of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) CoCrFeNiCu<sub>x</sub> significantly affects their susceptibility to solidification and liquation cracking (Fig. 6). The compositions of the five alloys investigated are shown in Table 1. Alloys CoCrFeNiCu<sub>0.5</sub>, CoCrFeNiCu<sub>1</sub> and CoCrFeNiCu<sub>1.5</sub> are most susceptible to solidification cracking, CoCrFeNiCu<sub>2</sub> is next, and CoCrFeNiCu<sub>0</sub> is least susceptible (Fig. 6).</p>\n<p>7. The effect of the Cu content on the solidification cracking susceptibility can be predicted based on the simple index proposed recently by the PI.</p>\n<p>8. The effect of the Cu content on the susceptibility to liquation cracking in the partially melted zone (near the weld) is similar to that of solidification cracking (Fig. 6). Liquation cracking often propagates from the partially melted zone into the fusion zone as solidification cracking (Fig. 6).</p>\n<p>9. Alloy CoCrFeNiCu<sub>1 </sub>was quenched with liquid Wood's metal during welding, and its solidification microstructure evolution was revealed.</p>\n<p>10.&nbsp; An isopleth (the vertical section of a phase diagram) was calculated from equimolar CoCrFeNi to pure Cu, instead of to equimolar CoCrFeNiCu as done by previous investigators. This new isopleth allowed the revealed solidification microstructure evolution of alloy CoCrFeNiCu<sub>1</sub> to be interpreted. It included a Cu-lean fcc phase Fcc1 as the primary solidification phase, a monotectic reaction, and a miscibility gap between a Cu-lean liquid L1 and a Cu-rich liquid L2.</p>\n<p>11.&nbsp; The mushy zone of alloy CoCrFeNiCu<sub>1 </sub>consists of two regions. The first region is right behind the weld pool, consisting of Fcc1 dendrites and L1 as the interdendritic liquid. The second region is behind the first region, consisting of Fcc1 dendrites and L2 as the interdendritic liquid.</p>\n<p>12.&nbsp; The effect of the Cu content on the solidification microstructure evolution of CoCrFeNiCu<sub>x</sub> alloys was investigated. Increasing the Cu content makes the dendrites finer and shortens the first region of the mushy zone.</p>\n<p>Table 1 Compositions of CoCrFeNiCu<sub>x</sub> alloys in atomic %.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"120\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>Alloy</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"70\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>Co</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>Cr</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>Fe</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>Ni</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>Cu</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"120\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>CoCrFeNiCu<sub>0</sub></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"70\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>26.14</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>23.06</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>24.77</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>26.03</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>0</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"120\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>CoCrFeNiCu<sub>0.5</sub></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"70\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>22.91</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>20.21</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>21.71</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>22.82</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>12.35</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"120\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>CoCrFeNiCu<sub>1</sub></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"70\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>20.39</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>17.99</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>19.32</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>20.31</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>21.99</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"120\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>CoCrFeNiCu<sub>1.5</sub></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"70\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>18.37</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>16.21</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>17.41</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>18.23</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>29.71</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"120\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>CoCrFeNiCu<sub>2</sub></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"70\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>16.72</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>14.75</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>15.84</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>16.65</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"66\" valign=\"top\">\n<p>36.05</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/24/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sindo&nbsp;Kou</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904503/1904503_10620970_1687649177715_Fig1HotCrackinginWelding--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904503/1904503_10620970_1687649177715_Fig1HotCrackinginWelding--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 1 Three types of hot cracking\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904503/1904503_10620970_1687649177715_Fig1HotCrackinginWelding--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 1 Three types of hot cracking\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 1 Welding-induced tension can cuase cracking where bonding between grains is weakened by liquid along grain boundaries (solidification and liquation cracking) or by grain-boundary sliding under low ductility (ductility-dip cracking).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">PI</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sindo&nbsp;Kou</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 1 Three types of hot cracking</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904503/1904503_10620970_1687651335407_Fig02TMWTest304vs310v3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904503/1904503_10620970_1687651335407_Fig02TMWTest304vs310v3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 2 Solidification cracking test\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904503/1904503_10620970_1687651335407_Fig02TMWTest304vs310v3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 2 Solidification cracking test\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 2 Lap welding a lower plate moving at speed V to a stationary upper plate to cause transverse tension in mushy zone and hence solidification cracking.

The effect of the Cu content on the susceptibility to liquation cracking in the partially melted zone (near the weld) is similar to that of solidification cracking (Fig. 6). Liquation cracking often propagates from the partially melted zone into the fusion zone as solidification cracking (Fig. 6).\n\n9. Alloy CoCrFeNiCu1 was quenched with liquid Wood's metal during welding, and its solidification microstructure evolution was revealed.\n\n10.  An isopleth (the vertical section of a phase diagram) was calculated from equimolar CoCrFeNi to pure Cu, instead of to equimolar CoCrFeNiCu as done by previous investigators. This new isopleth allowed the revealed solidification microstructure evolution of alloy CoCrFeNiCu1 to be interpreted. It included a Cu-lean fcc phase Fcc1 as the primary solidification phase, a monotectic reaction, and a miscibility gap between a Cu-lean liquid L1 and a Cu-rich liquid L2.\n\n11.  The mushy zone of alloy CoCrFeNiCu1 consists of two regions. The first region is right behind the weld pool, consisting of Fcc1 dendrites and L1 as the interdendritic liquid. The second region is behind the first region, consisting of Fcc1 dendrites and L2 as the interdendritic liquid.\n\n12.  The effect of the Cu content on the solidification microstructure evolution of CoCrFeNiCux alloys was investigated. Increasing the Cu content makes the dendrites finer and shortens the first region of the mushy zone.\n\nTable 1 Compositions of CoCrFeNiCux alloys in atomic %.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlloy\n\n\n\nCo\n\n\n\nCr\n\n\n\nFe\n\n\n\nNi\n\n\n\nCu\n\n\n\n\n\nCoCrFeNiCu0\n\n\n\n26.14\n\n\n\n23.06\n\n\n\n24.77\n\n\n\n26.03\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nCoCrFeNiCu0.5\n\n\n\n22.91\n\n\n\n20.21\n\n\n\n21.71\n\n\n\n22.82\n\n\n\n12.35\n\n\n\n\n\nCoCrFeNiCu1\n\n\n\n20.39\n\n\n\n17.99\n\n\n\n19.32\n\n\n\n20.31\n\n\n\n21.99\n\n\n\n\n\nCoCrFeNiCu1.5\n\n\n\n18.37\n\n\n\n16.21\n\n\n\n17.41\n\n\n\n18.23\n\n\n\n29.71\n\n\n\n\n\nCoCrFeNiCu2\n\n\n\n16.72\n\n\n\n14.75\n\n\n\n15.84\n\n\n\n16.65\n\n\n\n36.05\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/24/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sindo Kou"
