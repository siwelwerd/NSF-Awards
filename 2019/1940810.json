A Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) focusing on students and early career attendees will also take place the weekend prior to the GRC. The theme of the conference is \"Engineered Response in Soft Matter\" which focuses on the fundamental models and mechanics of soft and active systems, their response to external stimuli, and their applications in medicine, biology, additive manufacturing, and energy storage.  This award will partially support registration and travel cost for doctoral students and early career scientists to attend the GRC/GRS.  The conference will provide graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and young faculty members with opportunities to engage with leaders in soft matter research in the unique GRC setting. The success of the meeting will be assessed using established GRC guidelines.\r\n\r\nThis conference is the 19th meeting of the GRC on colloidal, macromolecular, and polyelectrolyte solutions since its inception in 1984. The PIs are experts in colloids and soft matter research and have put together a program that will bring a diverse mix of highly successful researchers together to discuss topics of interest.  A preliminary program for both the GRC and GRS includes presentations with follow-on discussion sessions as well as two-hour poster sessions held each afternoon to enable additional exchanges and discussion of research contributions in a less formal setting. This meeting will provide participants with an interdisciplinary forum to exchange knowledge and to discuss convergent solutions to global problems that require the insight of the colloids, macromolecules and polyelectrolyte communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
