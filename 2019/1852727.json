 "awd_abstract_narration": "The jet streams are belts of westerly winds in the extratropics of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  They steer storm tracks across the United States, Europe, and Asia, as well as Australia, New Zealand, and South America and play a critical role in precipitation and extreme weather in the mid-latitudes.  This research explores the response of the jet streams and storm tracks to slow variations of ocean surface temperatures and radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere due to greenhouse gas emissions as well as volcanic aerosols by major eruptions.  The position and intensity of the mid-latitude storm tracks affect precipitation and extreme weather for a substantial fraction of the world's population. This project will develop strategies to validate and improve weather and climate forecast prediction systems.  Policy makers, industry stakeholders, and the public rely on model forecasts of storm tracks, and of potential trends in the future, to make informed decisions.  The research will also support the education and training of three graduate students. It will provide them the opportunity to develop a physical understanding of the atmospheric circulation, computer-based modeling of weather and climate, and experience with high performance scientific computing.\r\n\r\n\r\nClimate models generally predict a poleward shift in the jet streams in response to global warming, but there is considerable uncertainty in the amplitude and structure of jet stream changes.  This project will contrast established mechanisms that rely primarily on dry dynamical theory by exploring the role of moisture, which is a significant source of uncertainty for predicting jet streams.  As warmer air can hold more moisture, it is expected that the atmosphere will be more strongly influenced by moist processes in the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This project investigated the large-scale atmospheric circulation, focusing on the jet streams and associated storm systems, which are often called the storm tracks.  These features dominate the weather of the midlatitude atmosphere, including much of North America.  Global warming is changing the water cycle of the atmosphere, increasing the availability of water in the lower atmosphere, particularly in the tropical latitudes.  This provides a larger source of energy for storm systems, which could increase both their destructive wind power and their ability to deliver extreme precipitation.  Other human induced changes in the atmosphere, such as the reduction in the north-south temperature gradient at the surface, may counteract these increases.  Accurate projections of the strength and location of stroma are important for quantifying the potential costs of climate change and developing strategies to keep our communities safe.\n \nThere was a wide gap between our understanding of how these competing changes will affect storm activity, versus our ability to simulate these changes with state-of-the-art numerical weather and climate prediction models.  To help bridge this gap, we strengthen our theoretical understanding of moisture's impact on midlatitude storms.  We also built and exploited intermediate numerical models, which allow us to translate this new understanding into practical improvements in climate and weather prediction systems.  The insights from simpler models also give us greater confidence in climate model projections of future changes in storm activity.\n \nA companion goal of the project was to understand how the stratosphere impacts surface weather and climate, both to make better weather forecasts today, and to understand its role in circulation changes at the surface.  The stratosphere is a cold, inhospitable layer of the atmosphere above the clouds, but it has been shown to couple with the troposphere, \"weather layer\" in which we live. This coupling can drive changes in storm activity and extreme events.  It also provides us a pathway to make better weather forecasts.\n \nWe quantified the role of the stratosphere in today?s weather and climate, helping to establish how both short term variability and long term trends in the stratosphere impact surface weather and climate.  We also built simpler models of the atmosphere to understand the stratosphere's role in future changes in storm activity projected by climate models, in particular, how the healing of the stratospheric ozone layer will affect surface weather in the Southern Hemisphere in coming decades.\n \nThis research also led to the discovery of a curious vacillation in the tropical atmosphere, where anomalous weather patterns develop in the upper troposphere -- around the highest levels where commercial aircraft fly -- and then propagate down to the surface over about 10 days.  This comparatively slow mode of atmospheric variability could hold potential for improving predictions of surface weather.  And while the utility of this phenomenon remains to be fully exploited, it shows that our atmosphere may hide yet more fascinating modes of variability, waiting to be discovered.  \n \nFinally, this project partially supported the training of several graduate students, two of whom have already earned their PhD degrees, and three more working towards their degrees.  NSF support allowed these junior scientists to become experts in weather and climate prediction, and more generally, training them how to blend theoretical understanding and high performance computing to solve complex problems. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edwin P Gerber"
