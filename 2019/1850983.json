 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the activities of the Ocean Carbon and Biogeochemistry (OCB) Project Office, based at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The OCB Program was created in 2006 as one of the major activities of the U.S. Carbon Cycle Science Program to promote, plan, and coordinate multidisciplinary activities and research opportunities involving the ocean carbon cycle. OCB supports a continually growing scientific network that fosters interdisciplinary collaborations and advances our mechanistic understanding of marine ecosystem-carbon cycle dynamics and their responses to environmental change. The OCB Project Office, as the hub of the OCB Program, coordinates high-impact community activities that bring different disciplines together to advance scientific understanding in all aspects of ocean carbon cycle research. OCB activities provide an effective interdisciplinary model and forum for scientific inquiry and discussion that have yielded numerous benefits in the form of new collaborations and funded projects, field campaigns, manuscripts, special journal volumes and other publications such as science plans, and opportunities to engage with U.S. and international science planning initiatives. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this award is to continue NSF support of the OCB Project Office and its community activities. Activities proposed for the next five years include OCB's annual interdisciplinary summer workshop and community-driven scoping workshops, small group, training, and capacity building activities, which are grassroots, community-driven efforts determined through an annual open community solicitation. OCB will continue to engage scientists and broader audiences on issues pertaining to the ocean carbon cycle through early career engagement and travel support; development and distribution of education and outreach products; and high-impact communication platforms, including a new, more navigable and attractive website (us-ocb.org), topical informational websites (e.g., ocean fertilization), a highly subscribed (>1,800 members) eNewsletter The Ocean Carbon Exchange, and social media platforms. With its responsive style, OCB will also continue to facilitate timely scientific synthesis activities and strengthen partnerships with U.S. and international partner programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
