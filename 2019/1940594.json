 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Universality & Accident in Complexity: The Odyssean Quest of Murray Gell-Mann\" is a Symposium organized to honor the life works and memory of Nobel Prize Laureate, Dr. Murray Gell-Mann. The Symposium will bring together research leaders across diverse disciplines for intense discussions about the common mechanisms underpinning the dynamics of complex systems. Dr. Gell-Mann's legacy will be used as a conversation starter to form creative partnerships and inform cutting-edge research designed to support and further the creative thinking needed to find solutions to complex problems. Most importantly, this activity is a training opportunity for a new generation of junior researchers that will help accelerate the cross-disciplinary collaborative scientific exchanges needed to identify novel problems and solutions in the investigation of complex systems. As such, this project will facilitate the scientific and professional development of early-career researchers as well as inclusion of scientists from traditionally underrepresented groups. The symposium will be held at the Santa Fe Institute in Santa Fe, NM, in March 2020.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Although Gell-Mann was best known for his contributions to particle physics, for which he won the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physics, Gell-Mann wanted to understand the \"chain of relationships\" that connected the universal laws of physics to complex systems like economies and human cultures. He described these extremes of interest in his 1994 book,&nbsp;<em><span>The Quark and the Jaguar</span></em>&nbsp;<em><span>Adventures in the Simple and the Complex</span></em>, as \"two aspects of nature...on the one hand, the underlying physical laws of matter and the universe, and on the other, the rich fabric of the world that we perceive directly and of which we are a part.\" In 1984 Gell-Mann co-founded the Santa Fe Institute (SFI), a nonprofit research and education institute exploring the science of complex systems.</span></p>\n<p><span>After postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the symposium was held virtually in September 2021.&nbsp; It brought together scientists, students, journalists, industry representatives, writers, artists and other stakeholders, from very diverse backgrounds, to reflect on Dr. Gell-Mann's contributions to physics and particularly to complexity science, as well as to discuss how the themes in Dr. Gell-Mann's work will influence research going forward.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>The diverse range of participants in the symposium also facilitated the scientific and professional development of early career researchers and accelerated cross-disciplinary discussions and collaborations to help identify novel problems and solutions in the investigation of complex issues. &nbsp;In October 2021, sixty-eight researchers from around the globe contributed to the book,&nbsp;<em><span>The Complex Alternative: Complexity Scientists on the COVID-19 Pandemic,&nbsp;</span></em>which was published by SFI Press.</span></p>\n<p><span>A second outcome of the award will be the publication by SFI Press of a book box set focused on Murray Gell-Mann's interest in universality and devotion to complexity science, to honor Dr. Gell-Mann's life and work. The set is in press and will be published by November 2023. The publication will include a special edition of&nbsp;<em><span>The Quark and the Jaguar</span></em>&nbsp;by Murray Gell-Mann, a revised edition of&nbsp;<em><span>Strange Beauty</span></em>, the biography of Murray Gell-Mann, by George Johnson, and a short book titled&nbsp;<em><span>Strangeness</span></em>&nbsp;that highlights Murray's interest in phenomenology outside of physics including natural history, ornithology, linguistics, and archeology.</span></p>\n<p><span>A third outcome was a recent profile in a new public-facing quarterly periodical,&nbsp;<em><span>Santa Fe Magazine</span></em>, featuring interviews with prominent and ingenious New Mexicans, in which we included excerpts from Murray's Nobel Prize acceptance speech, as well as a photograph of the original Eight-Fold Way calculation taken from SFI's collection of Murray's notebooks.</span></p>\n<p><span>These outcomes will inform future creative partnerships and cutting-edge research by supporting and furthering the creative thinking needed to address complex problems.
