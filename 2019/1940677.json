 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports travel for students in robotics to participate in the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference, along with its associated workshops in 2020 at the Oregon Sate University.  The students will be mentored both through being paired with senior PhD students and postdocs and participation in a mentorship event led by the RSS conference chair. By exposing early career researchers, including those from underrepresented groups, to this type of intellectual environment, they will be better able to be situated in the robotics field and get better ideas for the type and quality of research needed to have impact in the field.\r\n\r\nThis project supports travel for students in robotics. Awardees of these travel grants will fill out post conference surveys to help measure the effects of attending the conference.  Analysis of the responses will help tailor future travel awards.  One goal of these travel grants is to expand the pool of future researchers to have a more diverse set of backgrounds than is currently typically found amongst researchers in robotics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
