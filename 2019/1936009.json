It seeks to bring together researchers from industrial, academic and government laboratories to discuss the state-of-the-art in polymer matrix science for energy, biomedical, aerospace, marine and infrastructure applications, and to define key materials development challenges to meet the needs of emerging requirements in these sectors.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is organized to facilitate interaction among researchers, with a schedule consisting of short talks in specific areas followed by panel discussions, morning and evening talks and poster sessions, planned break-out discussion sections, and free afternoons for informal networking. The workshop will specifically target interactions among researchers with experimental, computational, and theoretical backgrounds to help advance knowledge and prediction to accelerate implementation of new high performance materials. The NSF partial support will enable graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty to attend the conference and present posters of their research. The faculty and graduate student participants will gain perspective of current research advances in polymer matrix science and emerging material needs to support the safety and health of our nation, and will help develop broad professional interactions.\r\n\r\nThe workshop on Polymer Composites and High Performance Materials fulfills a need for a focused conference in this important area involving technological materials that are widely used in varied applications and will bring together researchers from academia, government and industry. The workshop is expected to catalyze interactions and sustainable collaborations between the participants. Selected papers presented at the workshop will be published in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces. In addition, a summary of the workshop outcomes will be published on the ACS POLY website.\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
