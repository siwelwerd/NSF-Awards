 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use state-of-the-art measurement methods to investigate photolysis reactions that are important in the atmosphere. Specifically, the team will develop a new methodology for quantum yield measurements of complex molecules using chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS). Initial efforts will focus on investigating reactions which arise from radiation interacting with ketones in the upper troposphere. The research team will use the results to better understand the concentrations of reaction species in the upper troposphere. The project will also support training of a graduate study and a postdoctoral researcher.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will use CIMS to detect radical reaction products from the photolysis of acetone and other ketones as a function of wavelength, O2, pressure, and temperature. Data will provide experimental constraints which will contribute to our understanding of the upper tropospheric HOx and PAN budgets. Additionally, this new method for measuring quantum yields has the potentially to be used in numerous future experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
