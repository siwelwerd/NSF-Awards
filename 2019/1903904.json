 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel grant supports students and early career researchers to participate in an interdisciplinary workshop. The meeting will stimulate discussion between the geophysics and mechanics/engineering communities. They will identify outstanding problems and advance the state-of-the-art in mechanical models for geophysical problems. Scientific areas for collaboration include rock mechanics, seismology, physical volcanology and fracture mechanics.  Dealing with big data and more realistic models will be a focus of the effort. The meeting will take place at the University of California, San Diego.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
