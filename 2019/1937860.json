The only way to scale up the quantum communication rate is by increasing the number of degrees of freedom (modes) used by the transmitted photons. While polarization and frequency degrees of freedom have already been extensively explored, encoding the quantum information into the spatial modes (beam profiles) propagating in low-loss few-mode fibers has received little attention so far. This project aims to change this situation and open the spatial degrees of freedom for quantum communications by implementing encoders and decoders of spatial quantum information directly inside the fiber. \r\nOpening up a large number of spatial degrees of freedom will dramatically increase quantum communication rates and enable many future long-distance quantum networking applications. In addition, the developed spatial-mode selection technology could find its use also in classical telecommunications, e.g., in mode demultiplexing or in transfer of information between spatial and frequency modes. This project will train two students in nonlinear optics, quantum information processing, and optical communications. UTA is a minority-serving institution, and we will stimulate the interest in photonics from undergraduates and K-12 students via Open Lab events and visually-appealing demos.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nThe goal of this exploratory project is to realize two key functions necessary for transmitting and receiving quantum information over spatially-multimode or few-mode optical fibers - the spatially-entangled photon-pair generation and spatial-mode-selective quantum frequency conversion - directly in a few-mode fiber (FMF) by means of inter-modal four-wave mixing. By employing pumps in two FMF modes, we will generate a signal-idler photon pair in these two orthogonal spatial modes. The FMF phase-matching conditions will enable two simultaneous FWM processes driven by two-wavelength pumps in each of the modes, which can be adapted to realize both functions mentioned above. Implementation of this spatial-quantum-information-processing functionality directly in FMF, unlike the previous approaches relying on second-order nonlinearity in exotic multimode waveguides, eliminates any coupling loss and crosstalk and utilizes the FMF medium that is already available commercially and is also widely customizable by a number of vendors and research institutions. This work could have a transformative impact on high-capacity quantum communications by enabling spatially-multimode-fiber-based quantum links.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
