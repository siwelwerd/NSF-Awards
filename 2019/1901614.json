 "awd_abstract_narration": "Volcanic eruptions are dynamic and complex, making both monitoring and understanding their source processes challenging. Infrasound, or low frequency sound waves, is becoming increasingly used to monitor and study volcanic eruptions. Volcanic jets are prolific producers of volcanic jet noise, the sound produced by turbulent flow from a volcanic vent. Volcanic jet noise was heard extensively during the 2018 Kilauea East Rift Zone eruption. Despite its increasing use, many questions on volcanic jet noise remain. The investigators will perform a systematic set of linked field and laboratory experiments to address fundamental questions on volcanic jet noise and assumptions typically made when interpreting volcano infrasound data. The lab experiments will be performed at the unique facility of project collaborator LMU (Munich, Germany) that can reproduce gas and particle jets under controlled source parameters. At Stromboli Volcano, Italy, the researchers will examine jetting from eruptions and determine the jet noise radiation pattern. The observations from the lab and field will be used to interpret and determine source parameters (e.g. jet velocity and flux) for eruptions at both Kilauea and Stromboli, as well as previously collected volcano infrasound data. The project results will have significant implications for hazard monitoring at volcano observatories in Alaska and Hawaii, the results will be presented to the general public in those regions, and broad international collaboration and training will occur. \r\n\r\nThis project will integrate unique lab and field observations of volcanic jet noise to provide new insight into volcanic eruptions. The lab experiments will, for the first time, simulate the generation of volcanic jet noise while varying sound-influencing parameters such as particle concentration, particle shape, vent geometry, temperature, and Mach number. The field experiment at Stromboli Volcano, Italy will address the assumed highly directional nature of volcanic jet noise using advantageous topography and reliable eruptive activity, as well as providing critical corresponding high-speed visual and infrared imagery. The investigators will also capitalize on near-source infrasound and visual data collected during the 2018 Kilauea fissure eruption. By combining these three data sets, the researchers will determine the principal features and complexities of volcanic jet noise, including the characteristic frequency spectra, highly directional sound radiation, and unique waveform characteristics. These analyses will help determine 1) new scaling laws relating jet velocity to acoustic power and 2) improved eruption source constraints such as particle content and jet diameter, thus having direct implications for understanding and monitoring of volcanic eruptions worldwide. \r\n\r\nThis award is cofunded by the Prediction of and Resilience against Extreme Events (PREEVENTS) program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
