 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part I: Non-Technical Summary\r\n\r\nCrystallization was one of the earliest chemical processes studied by humans, as indicated by evidence of the practice of salt crystallization from seawater in pre-historic times.  Today, the ability to control crystal growth is essential to technological devices such as solar cells and lasers as well as in preparation of pharmaceutical agents.  However, the fundamental mechanisms underlying crystal growth are not fully understood.  Classical nucleation theory, which is the widely accepted model for how crystals grow, does not fully account for experimental measurements.  \r\n\r\nIn this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, the PI will continue to develop a new model of crystal growth initiated in his laboratory for formation of crystals from molten materials.  The new project extends this theory to crystal growth from solutions by studying the arrangement of starting materials in the solutions and the speeds at which solid crystals form under varying conditions.  Taken together, these experiments will increase understanding of crystal growth, eventually allowing scientists to develop better procedures for growing high-quality crystals for applications.  The project also encompasses training of students and postdoctoral researchers, including their participation in advanced experiments at national synchrotron facilities.     \r\n\r\nPart II: Technical Summary\r\n\r\nThe recently developed Transition Zone Theory of crystallization, based on the cooperativity of crystallizing units rather than a classical particle attachment/detachment conception, accurately describes the crystal growth rates from melts of diverse materials.  This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, tests the hypothesis that similar entropic and cooperative influences are responsible for controlling crystallization from solution.  This work extends the model to encompass crystallization from solution by studying the kinetics of crystal growth across binary phase diagram systems to determine the respective activation energy requirements to form long-range order in crystals and to exclude solvent from the crystallizing solute.\r\n\r\nUsing representative systems of hydrated metal salts and aromatic organic molecules, the project uses spectroscopic and diffraction methods to investigate 1) the structure of saturated solutions, 2) comparative crystallization rates as a function of solvent/solute concentration from the pure phase to eutectic compositions, and 3) comparative rates of crystallization out of diverse solvents for which strong solvent-solute interactions are likely to inhibit crystallization.  The long-term goal is that an extension of the Transition Zone Theory model can provide the basis for a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of crystal growth across a continuum of systems from pure metals to saturated solutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHow do crystals grow from solution?  This age-old question reflects one of the earliest chemical experiments conducted by humans crystallizing salt from sea water.  Despite the universal importance from fundamental geologic understanding to growing crystals for advanced technologies, scientists have a limited understanding of the atomic and molecular level mechanism(s) of crystal growth.  Having previously discovered Transition Zone Theory (TZT) which accurately describes crystal growth from melts, this EAGER grant provided support to explore if or how TZT might also apply to crystal growth out of saturated solutions.\n\nThe system.\n\nWe identified aqueous zinc chloride, ZnCl2?R H2O (3 &le; R &lt;4.3), from which [Zn(OH2)6][ZnCl4] crystallizes, to be an effective test system for investigating how the solution concentration impacts temperature-dependent crystal growth rates.  Selected video frames from an in situ Polarized Optical Microscopy (POM) crystallization experiment are shown in Fig 1.\n\nTemperature and Concentration Dependent Crystal Growth Rates.\n\nEvaluation of crystal growth rates for multiple concentrations and temperatures revealed three types of solution crystal growth (Fig. 2).  Immediately following nucleation, or at the onset of growth of a melt-seeded system, growth is fast (melt-like), approaching rates observed for the pure stoichiometric phase.  A largely linear growth rate is observed for the majority of crystal growth (standard).  As nutrient is depleted from the solution, the growth rate is slowed (deceleratory), until equilibrium is achieved and growth ceases. \n\nInitial analysis of ten sample concentrations (3.0 &lt; R &lt; 3.9) between their liquidus and -60 &ordm;C demonstrates the standard growth rate is reasonably described by our TZT.  Notably, the same enthalpic, entropic and cooperativity parameters determined for the pure melt crystallization, can be used for saturated-solution crystallization.  However, for saturated solution crystallization, Tm of the pure melt must be replaced by the composition dependent liquidus temperature, Tliq.  One example is presented in Figure 3.  The preliminary data suggest an associative crystal growth mechanism whereby segregation of the crystallizing and diluent phases is a fast, non-rate determining step.  This segregation of the solution creates an amorphous melt-like intermediate from which the crystalline phase grows. \n\nSolution Structure and Properties.\n\nAn accurate understanding of Tliq, as well as the heat of fusion, &Delta;fusH, of the crystallizing phase is necessary to gain physical/chemical insight into crystallizing systems whether considering classical or our TZT crystal growth theories.  Nevertheless, it is well known that traditional theories fail to describe concentrated solutions, the very conditions required for crystal growth.  Combining our previous and newly collected (supported by this grant) data we produced the most extensive phase diagram of the H2O:ZnCl2 system, and discovered significant factors describing the mechanism of hydration (J. Phys. Chem. B., 2022).  That system exhibits a deep eutectic of about -80 &ordm;C at X(H2O) = 0.88, though no crystallization is observed between about (7 &lt; R &lt; 10).  Neither the deep eutectic behavior between water and the R = 4.5 crystalline hydrate, nor the eutectic between the R = 4.5 and 3 crystalline hydrates is reasonably modeled by the traditional expression, ln(1/X(A))=-&Delta;fusH(A)/R(1/Tm (A)-1/Tliq), even when the activity of ZnCl2 in water is substituted for the concentration X(H2O).\n\nWork supported by this grant demonstrates the classic models fail because of incomplete understanding of solution speciation, a failure to address strong solute-solvent interactions, and the diminished heat of fusion that can occur when solvent-solute interactions are stronger than the respective solute-solute and solvent-solvent interactions. To address this, we developed the Solvation Shell Ionic Liquid (SSIL) model of electrolyte solutions.  Extensive Raman spectroscopy and X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements demonstrate that the hydrated Zn2+ and [ZnCl4]2- ions persist to high dilution, i.e., ZnCl2 does not dissociate into Zn2+ + 2 Cl- in aqueous solution.  These along with IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy reveal a series of special ionic liquid compositions consistent with up to six hydration shells around aqueous Zn2+ cations.  Calorimetric measurements demonstrate that strong ion-dipole interactions reduce &Delta;fusHsol to about half that of pure water in the most concentrated solutions from which ice can crystallize.\n\nUnderstanding the ionic liquid species that exist in the relevant concentration/temperature phase space determines the material partition function, which describes the effective concentration of the solution, Xeff.  Utilizing the correct Xeff and the correct &Delta;fusHsol, determined by cation and anion interactions with water, as well as the ion pairing interactions, the SSIL model suggests that ln(1/Xeff(A))=-1/R(&Delta;fusH0/Tm (A)-&Delta;fusHsol/Tliq).  As shown in Fig. 4, the SSIL model (blue lines) accurately describes the experimental liquidus across the phase diagram from pure water to the R = 3 hydrate (XH2O = 0.75).\n\nBroader Impact\n\nIn keeping with the EAGER mission, this exploratory work clearly demonstrates our TZT platform will yield unprecedented detail regarding crystal growth from saturated solutions not recognized by classical theories.  The new SSIL model provides an explicit chemical/physical model of solutions which likely can replace traditional empirical models.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/14/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James D Martin"
