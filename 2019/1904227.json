 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the impact of market reforms on household relations and women's work in agriculture. The project asks: how does economic change shape gendered institutions such as the household and related labor markets? A central problem is that a significant portion of agricultural work is not measured appropriately, and thus unrecorded in official statistics.  Four research questions guide this project: (a) how are official measures  of  women's  work constructed?  (b) what  is  the  impact  of economic  change in agriculture  at  the  local level  upon  one  measure  of women's  work?  (c) what  role  does  women's  unpaid  work play  in  the  explanation  of  the  links between economic  change in agriculture and paid  work? (d) how  does economic change  affect  intrahousehold power  relations  and gender norms?  This project examines the ways in which regulatory changes in agricultural policy affect women's work in agricultural production and marketing at interconnected levels of analysis: national, local, and household. At each level, the project seeks to show how women's paid and unpaid work is officially and unofficially defined in agricultural communities, and how this work is redefined under economic change. The findings from this project will contribute to a broader understanding of a) women's work--paid and unpaid activities undertaken within and beyond the household and b) how large-scale policy decisions translate into decisions made at the family and individual level. These findings will help generate recommendations on how households' and women's lives in agricultural areas may  be improved by change in formal policies including those focused on contract farming, deregulation of sales, and privatization of markets.\r\n\r\nThis  project will examine the  processes  by  which women's  work, particularly work in agricultural contexts, is  rendered visible  or invisible  in  the  market  economy.  The project will use a convergent mixed methods research framework to study the relationship between economic change and gendered institutions like the household and related labor markets. Within this framework, quantitative data from censuses and surveys and qualitative data from primary sources will be collected in the same phase of data production; both strands of data will then be analysed independently and merged at the stage of interpretation of results. To collect primary data, in-depth semi-structured interviews will be conducted with 60 women engaged in farm work and also associated with farmer producer companies, along with participant observation on farms and at agricultural markets around a larger urban area.  Findings from the project will inform sociological theories regarding gender in agricultural work, economic change, and household gender relations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
