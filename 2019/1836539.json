 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project advances knowledge through its contribution to I-Corps Sites Instructors at universities across the nation by creating a consistent training approach to enhance quality of the I-Corps experience among the 99 funded I-Corps Sites.  The I-Corps South Node will leverage its extensive experience training National and Regional Instructors in the lean methodology to minimize inconsistencies among Sites teams' preparation level for participation in a National Cohort. Consistent teaching of the I-Corps methodology across the ecosystem of Teams, Regional and Sites programs will lead to increased intellectual consistency from instructors at all levels. As a result, teams will have more success in the translation between Sites and other programming levels, including Regional cohorts and the Teams program as well as the likelihood for success in advancing the I-Corps concepts into the private sector.  The formation of an Instructor Academy for Sites standardizes the training among Sites instructors, resulting in an increase in consistency among the instruction provided to Sites teams. The proposed pilot project to address and alleviate the inconsistencies in instruction among Sites, thereby increasing translation between the Sites and Teams programs. The Georgia Tech I-Corps South Node and has the potential to establish new norms in both instruction quality and the expectations Sites teams  have before pursuing National I-Corps Teams.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
