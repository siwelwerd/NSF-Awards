 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Observations of astrophysical gamma rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe and can be used to test fundamental physics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high-energy gamma rays. VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources. This award supports scientists at California Polytechnic State University to carry out research with VERITAS and with the new co-located prototype Schwartzchild-Couder Telescope (pSCT).  The group will work on extensions to the gamma-ray detection algorithms for VERITAS and the pSCT to further improve the sensitivity of the telescopes.  Undergraduate students will be involved in the research.  The group will also work with the Physics Teachers of the Central Coast through the Center for Engineering, Science and Education at California Polytechnic State University to develop educational modules around morphology, spectra, and variability of active galaxies. \r\n\r\nVERITAS has embarked upon a broad program of Galactic and extragalactic source observations, as well as searches for very-high-energy electromagnetic counterparts to sources of gravitational waves and neutrinos.  With this award the California Polytech State University group will work on extensions to the Image Template Method (ITM), a new gamma-ray reconstruction algorithm.  With the improved sensitivity enabled by ITM the group will search for very-high-energy gamma rays from active galaxies, which are likely to be the sites of multi-messenger acceleration, and use observations of dwarf galaxies to set dark matter limits.  The group will engage undergraduate students in the discovery of new very-high-energy emitting active galaxies triggered by the VERITAS Target of Opportunity program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In 2017, the PI invited undergraduates to join the VERITAS effort to discover very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from Active Galaxies. Since then, twenty students have participated in the project. They have learned new computer skills and the data analysis techniques needed to identify gamma-ray signals. They related the signals to the physical mechanisms going on near the supermassive black holes in AGN. The extreme application of modern physics combined with the excitement of discovering new sources of very-high energy gamma rays is a powerful introduction to what research is all about and it is a great motivator for studying physics. The computational nature of this work also served students well during the Covid shutdowns when face-to-face research wasnt possible. In the past two years, six students were able to join the PI on 5-day observing shifts in Arizona. Many of the students are pursuing graduate studies. The PI also served on the VERITAS Science Board as the representative for the Associate Members.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JodiLChristiansen\n"
