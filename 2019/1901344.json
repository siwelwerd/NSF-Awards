It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at Virginia Union University will investigate the relationship between acid-base transporters and voltage-gated ion pumps in hippocampal cell activation. Moreover, the project will expand the research capacity of the institution by providing research opportunities for minority undergraduate students and preparing them for graduate school or direct entry into the STEM work force.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this study is to understand the regulation of proteins in neurons and astrocytes of the hippocampus, the area in the brain involved in learning and memory. Western blot will be used to examine and quantify the expression of select proteins previously identified in the hippocampus involved in the generation of electrical excitability (Nav1.1, Kv1.1, Cav2.1, Na/K ATPase, and KATP) and acid-base regulation (SLC9 and SLC4). Additionally, the expression profiles of the co-localization of these proteins in primary cultured hippocampal cultures will be defined under various concentrations of CO2, N2 and chronic hypoxia. Data obtained from this study will potentially extend the knowledge related to neuronal protein expression during hypoxic stress during both physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over the course of the award, more than 200 students have been exposed to cutting-edge research techniques, such as gel electrophoresis, western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. These skills were infused into the departmental curriculum for five courses (BIO 111, BIO 112, BIO 411, BIO 412, and HSC 690) and were used as foundational research for the newly created master&rsquo;s programs in Biology and Health Sciences. This comprehensive integration of research experiences has significantly enhanced students' competitiveness upon graduation, enabling them to persist in higher education and pursue advanced degrees in STEM fields.&nbsp;As part of this initiative, students gathered original data and presented their findings at their home institution, at other prestigious universities such as Harvard, Virginia Commonwealth University, and the University of Virginia, as well as at national conferences. The hands-on experience and exposure to rigorous research practices have prepared them for further studies, with several students advancing to master&rsquo;s programs in physiology at UCLA and Ph.D. programs at Oregon Health Science University.&nbsp;Additionally, the faculty within the department have established research programs across various disciplines, fostering collaborations with investigators from other institutions. These partnerships have not only enriched the academic environment at VUU but have also contributed to the broader scientific community. A significant outcome of this work was the publication of research findings in the *Journal of Neuroscience Research* (J Neurosci Res. 2022 August; 100(8): 1529&ndash;1537. doi:10.1002/jnr.24796).&nbsp;Overall, the award has had a transformative impact on Virginia Union University, positioning it as a hub for innovative research and enhancing its capacity to produce graduates who are well-prepared to contribute to the scientific community.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 09/03/2024<br>\nModified by: Vernon&nbsp;Ruffin</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1901344/1901344_10604253_1725381997855_Austin_and_Drexel_VUU--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1901344/1901344_10604253_1725381997855_Austin_and_Drexel_VUU--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dr. Austin Coley and Drexel/VUU\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1901344/1901344_10604253_1725381997855_Austin_and_Drexel_VUU--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Austin Coley and Drexel/VUU\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Collaborations established between Drexel University and Virginia Union University</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vernon Ruffin, Ph.D.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vernon&nbsp;Ruffin\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Dr. Austin Coley and Drexel/VUU</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1901344/1901344_10604253_1725381910299_Ruffin_Training_20240220--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1901344/1901344_10604253_1725381910299_Ruffin_Training_20240220--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Ruffin Training_20240220\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1901344/1901344_10604253_1725381910299_Ruffin_Training_20240220--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Ruffin Training_20240220\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. Vernon A, Ruffin training collage.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vernon Ruffin, Ph.D.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vernon&nbsp;Ruffin\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ruffin Training_20240220</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1901344/1901344_10604253_1725381835578_Ruffin_NeuroLab_Members--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1901344/1901344_10604253_1725381835578_Ruffin_NeuroLab_Members--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ruffin NeuroLab Members\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1901344/1901344_10604253_1725381835578_Ruffin_NeuroLab_Members--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ruffin NeuroLab Members\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Ruffin NeuroLab/Virginia Union University Protein Analysis members pictured at Virginia Union University</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vernon Ruffin, Ph.D.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vernon&nbsp;Ruffin\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ruffin NeuroLab Members</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1901344/1901344_10604253_1725382064261_Dr._Eyo_UVA--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1901344/1901344_10604253_1725382064261_Dr._Eyo_UVA--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Dr. Eyo_UVA\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1901344/1901344_10604253_1725382064261_Dr._Eyo_UVA--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Dr. Eyo_UVA\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Collaborations established between University of Virginia and Virginia Union University.
