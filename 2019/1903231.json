 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic is warming faster than any other area of the world and its boreal forests have experienced dramatic increases in the size and frequency of fires. The fast pace of these changes has prompted concern because boreal forests make up about a third of all forests worldwide, contain almost half of the world's stored carbon, and have been historically stable with black spruce dominating this landscape for the past 6,000 years. Warming of 2-8 \u00b0C is projected by the end of the century and the emergence of a new fire regime threatens to disrupt this forest ecosystem. For example, in some regions of interior Alaska, the fire return interval has decreased to 10-50 years, causing shifts from black spruce to deciduous trees and grasses. Changes in the climate and fire regime are also expected to affect global carbon cycling since fires and thawing of frozen soils (permafrost) may release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. This research will incorporate field studies and computer simulations to determine how fire frequency and climate change affect shifts between vegetation types (e.g. switch from conifer to grasses) and long term carbon storage in this vast and under-studied region. The study will train graduate students and involve Native American high school students from the Rural Alaska Honors Institute (RAHI) in field work. The investigators will collaborate with Your World Rocks (YWR), a nonprofit organization of female scientists and engineers dedicated to promoting science education in elementary schools. They will develop hands-on activities focusing on climate change, forests, and fire and conduct free hands-on activities in elementary schools in the greater Portland/Vancouver metro area, with a particular focus on underserved Title 1 schools. \r\n\r\nThe fast pace of climate warming and an increase in fire frequency over the past few decades in northern latitudes has raised concerns about major shifts in vegetation and the long-term ability of ecosystems to capture and store carbon. Boreal forest ecosystems account for about 33% of all forests worldwide and contain about 45% of the world's carbon stocks, with the majority (~85%) stored belowground. For the past 6,000 years, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) has been the dominant species over a large proportion of this landscape, exhibiting substantial resilience to changes in climate. However, unprecedented warming (causing earlier snowmelt, permafrost thawing, and longer growing seasons) and the emergence of a new fire regime over the past 60 years threatens to disrupt the existing dominance by black spruce and release globally significant amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. The goal of this research is to quantify the potential for large-scale changes in carbon (C) sink strength, C stocks, and vegetation in boreal forests due to climate change and repeated wildfires by integrating mechanistic field and lab work with dynamic, spatially explicit landscape modeling. Working in central Alaska, the investigators will: 1) determine how fire frequency and climate change affect successional trajectories and above- and belowground C cycling, and 2) assess how the mechanisms that cause tipping points between vegetation types (i.e. conifer, hardwood, graminoid) and C sequestration (i.e. sink, source) vary spatially and temporally. To achieve these objectives, the investiagors will empirically measure above- and belowground C stocks, productivity, heterotrophic respiration, soil temperature and moisture content, and active layer thickness in the field and quantify C mineralization using laboratory soil incubations. They will also develop and validate a physically based permafrost/hydrology module for a widely-used, high resolution landscape simulation model (LANDIS-II) to forecast long-term dynamics of species composition and C source/sink status given projected changes in climate (including thawing permafrost) and fire. The work will improve our understanding of how C cycling and species composition in boreal forests will respond to climate change and disturbances at the fine spatial scales critical to accurately project the future of the boreal forest.",

It contains immense amounts of carbon in both the trees and the permafrost in the soil, sequestered from the atmosphere. Surprisingly to many, the boreal is also a system that burns frequently, and has burned regularly (about 100-300 years between fires) for thousands of years. But as the climate warms, fire frequency is increasing. This threatens the integrity of the forest and those carbon stocks. But we know very little about how the forest will response to increases in fire frequency, such as when fires start to be about 20-30 years apart instead of 100+ years apart. We need data on this globally important ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This project was the first study to explicitly seek out areas that have experienced three fires in just 75 years. We know already that two fires in short succession, termed \"reburns\" or \"short-interval fires,\" can eliminate conifer trees (primarily spruce) and promote broadleaf trees like birch and aspen. But what happens when those burn?&nbsp; The work here focused on how permafrost changed, how the ecosystem composition changed (e.g., trees vs. grass vs. shrubs), and what that means for carbon. Along the way, it trained a PhD student, seven undergraduates, generated several publications, presentations, and educational resources for teachers worldwide, an art installation, provided crucial information to fire managers/fighters, and created a group of new, primarily women scientific leaders in boreal forest ecology. And it is not done; we expect to continue to mine these data for important insights in the future.</p>\n<p>The ecology of the boreal is one of fire. The ecosystem has been stable, despite frequent burning, for many thousands of years. In the past, a reburn would cause the loss of conifer trees, leading to a more broadleaf forest cover. Those forests are more resistant to fires (less flammable, primarily due to moister leaves), and so we thought that those shifts would dampen the effects of climate change on fire frequency by breaking up the landscape into less flammable chunks. That did happen in the past, and our regional research via satellite imagery suggests that for a decade or so that \"dampening\" does continue even now. (This new technique has also been applied to the western US as part of this project). But we also found that boreal broadleaf forests can and do burn in extreme conditions, conditions we are more likely to experience as the climate warms. When those broadleaf systems burn again, even more carbon is lost and the ecosystem continues to change ? to a more shrub, woodland like system with more grass. This is a forest structure that generally has not been seen in these boreal forests, but one that may lead to increases in fires due to all the grassy, fine fuels and open structure that lets wind blow through more easily. Permafrost disappears rapidly, leading to increased soil drainage and drier soil conditions, further pushing fire likelihood upwards. Finally, carbon declines, meaning more carbon in the atmosphere that warms the region even further. These changes represent a potential positive feedback, ultimately likely producing more fires.</p>\n<p>The work here is the first to truly give a glimpse of the impacts of increasing fire frequency in the boreal forest. We found substantial change and traced that change through the various aspects of the ecosystem. It provided unique data, incredibly useful for pushing our expectations for the future, and generated fundamental insights into the ways in which forests change going forward. It has already spawned a variety of new projects in those directions, in particular projects working directly with fire managers - who need this information to better prepare for fire fighting and protection operations.
