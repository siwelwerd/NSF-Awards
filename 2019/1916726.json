 "awd_abstract_narration": "This IUCRC planning project will establish the feasibility of a multi-site Center for High-Assurance Secure Systems and Internet-of-Things (CHASSI) that will focus on areas where both security and high assurance are necessary to support operations of high mission criticality, due to safety or economic impact.  Examples include medical devices, manufacturing, the energy grid, real-time financial markets, construction, and defense.  Combining security and high-assurance is hard, however, intentionally combining them will lead to new models, techniques, designs, architectures, and systems that will be applicable across of range of important U.S. industries. \r\n\r\nCHASSI has five sites: University of Kansas (KU), University of Minnesota, Syracuse University, Case Western Reserve University, and Indiana University.  CHASSI research falls into four main thrusts: (1) Architectures, design and formal modeling for systems-level security, privacy, stability, and performance; (2) Secure communication, sensing, and devices; (3) Scalable trust and privacy; and (4) Human behavior for privacy and security.  In addition to expertise in security and cyber-physical systems, Minnesota brings considerable expertise and experience in safety critical systems, high assurance, and medical devices, areas nicely complementing the expertise at the partner institutions. \r\n\r\nThe planning grant will generate significant impacts on both research and education; researchers will understand the interests and needs/barriers in industry, industrial members will understand the research capabilities of faculty member at each Site, and companies will benefit from exposure to cutting-edge university research across all Sites. Minnesota will continue its engagement of student groups in organizing the various events associated with center activities and maintain the established close connection with the Bakken Medical Device center to enable translational research efforts and sustained continuous-education and tech-transfer events. Educational program offerings are also planned. \r\n\r\nThe collaborators from this multi-university-industry Center will host a single Center-wide repository at: https://chassi.ku.edu. This shared repository will include meeting materials, program information, publications, etc., and will be made available for a minimum of 5 years after conclusion of the award or until the Center transitions to the next phase.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThis planning project (CHASSI) established the feasibility of a multi-site industry-university cooperative research center called CHASSI (Center for High-Assurance SystemS and Internet-of-things.  The center will focus on areas where both security and high-assurance are necessary to support operations of high mission criticality upon which lives may depend or due to significant economic or societal impact.  Examples include medical devices, manufacturing, the energy grid, real-time financial markets, construction, and defense.  \n\n \nCHASSI would leverage the expertise of more than 40 cybersecurity and assurance faculty and hundreds of students across five university Sites: University of Kansas (KU, Lead), Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Indiana University (IU), Syracuse University (SU), and University of Minnesota (UMN).\n\n \nAll CHASSI Sites completed the IUCRC Bootcamp, mentoring sessions, and exceeded the required number of customer discovery interviews.  The CHASSI leadership team coordinated activities with weekly video conferences, augmented with site-to-site and one-on-one meetings as needed.    Originally scheduled for May 21-22, 2020, our Planning Workshop was postponed due to regulations and complications arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.  On November 13, 2020, we held an Insights Discussion workshop via Zoom attended by about 60 participants representing 25 potential partner organizations.  A Zoom-based Planning Workshop was held April 29-30, 2021; it was attended by more than 80 participants representing 30 different organizations.\n\n \nThe CHASSI team conducted over 160 customer discovery interviews.  We grouped 42 insights into 5 themes, and developed 30+ project ideas with Site faculty, all of which were presented and discussed at our Insights Discussion workshop.  Armed with feedback from potential partners,  we subsequently refined our research roadmap and  developed 10 integrated projects (many of which were multi-Site) that were presented at our 2-day planning workshop.\n\n \nBefore the planning workshop, participants received a packet with a one-slide ?quad chart? summary of each project.  During Day 1 of the meeting, pre-recorded videos were played followed by live Q&amp;A and filling in of Level of Interest and Feedback Evaluations (LIFE) forms for each potential project.  We also received substantial feedback within the LIFE system regarding technical details and approach, all of which were addressed by the associated project faculty, and discussed in a lively fashion by the industry members on Day 2\n\n \nOverall, the presented portfolio garnered strong support from potential Industry Advisory Board (IAB) members, with a large majority of Very Interested (VI) and Interested (I) ratings across the board within the LIFE form system.  \n\n \nAll five CHASSI Sites submitted Phase I proposals on June 9, 2021, which included 17 letters of commitment (only 15 were required) and a fully executed memorandum of understanding (MOU) among all the Sites.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mats Per Erik Heimdahl"
