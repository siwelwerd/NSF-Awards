The year's Lectures are entitled \"Recent Advancements in Number Theory\" and will feature a number of hour long plenary talks by high profile mathematicians, as well as shorter talks given by mostly early career researchers.  These talks will cover a range of topics in number theory and arithmetic geometry.  For more information, please visit the conference website at: http://www.math.utk.edu/barrett/\r\n\r\nThe Barrett Lectures began in 1970 as a tribute to Dr. John H. Barrett, a distinguished mathematician and influential Mathematics Department Head at the University of Tennessee.  Over the years, the Lectures have covered a large number of mathematical topics (which this year topics coming from number theory and arithmetic geometry), and have developed a rich history of excellence.  The Lectures are aimed to bring together researchers from various career stages in order to stimulate academic discussions and collaborations as well as to disseminate new topics and ideas among the community.  Attendees, especially graduate students and other early career researchers, will be exposed to the research of high profile mathematicians, that can inspire, motivate, and give new directions to their own research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
