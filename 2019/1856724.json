 "awd_abstract_narration": "Public Award Abstract\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that among mammals males are aggressive and females are not. Despite the common knowledge, this is a misconception that was born from testing and observing animal social behavior is situations that favored males to be aggressive. Female mammals are indeed aggressive, though in different circumstances than are males. This long-standing, but incorrect view, of sex differences in aggression has hindered our understanding of the biology underlying aggression in females. This research is therefore highly innovative in its concept and as well as its goal to correct the imbalance in our knowledge of the neuroscience of female aggression. The research will address a specific set of hypotheses targeted at brain sites regulating aggression in female animals. Within the nerve cells (neurons) in these brain areas, fluctuations in the balance of specific chemical reactions are proposed to regulate whether or not female animals engage in aggression. Finally, the idea that the nerve cells physically change as a result of repeated aggressive encounters (at least for the winners of those encounters) will be tested. Beyond the research itself and communicating the results of the research to the public, the research program will be used to foster science education in the classroom, provide public outreach in the form of community events and lectures, and to generate interest in scientific careers for undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThe research in this proposal is designed to uncover news insights into the regulation of female aggression in several realms. It is well known that winning an aggressive encounter increases the likelihood that females will be aggressive in future encounters. This experience-based escalation of aggression correlates with increased dendritic spine density in medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens, a novel finding for either males or females. Underlying this structural plasticity are changes in mTOR and FMRP signaling following aggressive experiences. This research identifies a natural role for FMRP and its regulation of neuronal plasticity beyond the pathology of fragile X syndrome, a research direction that is another innovative component of the proposed research. Further, the research in this proposal is designed to identify a functional link between aggression, intracellular signaling and structural changes in the nucleus accumbens. Overall, the research will test the novel hypothesis that there is a feed-forward process with repeated aggressive experience in females that escalates aggression in future encounters, thus increasing dominance and ultimately reproductive success. This behavioral process requires neuronal signaling that produces long-term plasticity in the nucleus accumbens. Collectively, the research will develop a detailed understanding of the neurobiology of female aggression, yielding a transformational shift in how we view aggression in female mammals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nAggression is a natural component of social behaviors among animal species, including people. One use of aggression is to maintain access to key resources such as territories, mating partners, food, and protection from predation. In the scientific literature, textbook accounts, and among the general population there is the prevailing view that aggression lies primarily in the realm of males, with females much less aggressive if they are aggressive at all. This prevailing view contradicts the reality that females across species commonly display aggression, often at similar levels than do males. This historical perspective emerged from formulating tests of aggression under conditions that optimize aggressive displays of males. At the same time it is wrong to assert that males are aggressive and that females are lesser so, it is correct to recognize that for any species that the contexts in which males and females are aggressive differ, that the underlying hormonal and physiological regulation differs between males and females, and that neural circuits (including mechanisms of synaptic transmission) controlling differ between the sexes. What makes the male-centric view of aggression so insidious is that it has suppressed scientific analyses of neural mechanisms underlying aggression in females. The overall goal of our research project was to develop a neurobiological understanding of the regulation of aggression in females.\n\n\nThis project was based on our development of female Syrian hamsters as an animal model of aggression. Female and male hamsters live in and defend individual territories in the wild. This territorial defense forms part of the ecological basis for aggression in the females. Experience in engaging in fights, and especially winning them, increases the efficiency of aggression in future encounters. In the laboratory we test aggression in the females home cage (territory) by introducing an intruding hamster. Females readily attack the intruders, with a reduction in the time it takes to initiate aggression over the days of testing. Once this escalation of aggression is established, it remains even with longer durations (a week or weeks) between attacks. The overall hypothesis tested in this project was that glutamate neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens was the basis for the experience-based escalation of aggression in female hamsters. Our prior research discovered that the repeated aggressive experiences produced structural changes in nucleus accumbens neurons in the form of small protrusions (termed spines) on the dendrites of the nerve cells. The dendrites are where the neuron receives chemical signals (e.g., glutamate) from the incoming neuronal axon, and the spines are the location of glutamate receptors.\n\n\nOur project produced several sets of findings. We first replicated our prior research results in which five aggression tests produced an escalation of aggression (as measured by the time it took for the home cage hamster to attack the intruder. This escalation was seen beginning the third of the five tests. We demonstrated that there were changes in the expression of glutamate receptors in the nucleus accumbens neurons which receive glutamate signals as a result of the repeated aggressive experiences. The five aggressive experiences produced a coordinated pattern of receptor activation that was not seen in the females not tested for aggression, nor was it seen following a single aggression test. In addition to the coordinated expression of glutamate receptors, we also found increased expression of the protein PSD-95, which is located on the dendritic spines. The change in this protein represents a biochemical replication of our structural findings. In a different study we took a similar behavioral approach to giving female hamsters aggressive experience, but here we measured changes in biochemical pathways triggered by activation of glutamate receptors to demonstrate that the changes in receptors produced enhanced chemical signaling (mTOR and ERK) that underlies the excitability of these neurons. In other words, the escalation of aggression across aggressive experiences paralleled biochemical changes in the neurons that increase the excitability of those cells. These findings are of high impact and novelty, as they are the first demonstrations of neuronal plasticity tracking the behavioral plasticity resulting from repeated aggression experiences in a female model of social aggression.\n\n\nThe research project was used to provide intellectual and research training for undergraduate students and a postdoctoral fellow. We involved several undergraduates in the research, one of whom was from a demographic underrepresented in the field of neuroscience. This student contributed importantly to the research project to the extent that they earned authorship on one of the publications emerging from the research. The postdoctoral primarily involved in the project also comes from a demographic underrepresented in neuroscience.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RobertLMeisel\n"
