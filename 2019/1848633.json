 "awd_abstract_narration": "Soil is a vital resource but processes controlling soil production are not well understood. Data collected in previously NSF-funded studies, along with new data, will be used to better understand how soil is produced in different environments. The depth of soil is likely closely linked to the soil production rate and how rivers erode. How rivers and soils interact has practical consequences for river infrastructure and human impacts on landscapes such as deforestation or forest fires. How sustainable is soil given a changing Earth? Undergraduate and graduate students and a post-doctoral scholar will contribute to this research project. The team will also use 3D printers to make synthetic landscapes to be used as part of outreach to K-12 students who are visually impaired or have Autism Spectrum Disorder.\r\n\r\nIn the Rio Blanco watershed in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory, we will map patterns in surface soil thickness, grain size, and soil chemistry across the landscape and tie these to new rates of soil production and soil grain residence time. Theoretical hillslope-channel coupling will be modeled using the Landlab modeling toolkit and a recently published analytical model that predicts the grain size distribution of sediment fed to channels as a function of climate and erosion rate, which controls the residence time of soil particles. We will also build a new fluvial incision modeling component to incorporate the influence of sediment load, including grain size, on bedrock incision rates. Further, data from the Rio Blanco will be used to calibrate a Landlab model.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Hurricane Maria in September 2017 triggered over 50,000 landslides, which damaged roads, housing, and other infrastructure. Landslides also deliver soil and rocks, collectively called sediment, into rivers. This study explored how sediment delivery from hillslopes impacts how rivers erode and shape the landscape. We considered both landslides, which happen very quickly, and slower processes caused by gravity, biotic processes, and flowing water. Here we define a hillslope as the part of the landscape between rivers that does not have human-built infrastructure (not roads, houses, etc.).</p>\n<p>Our primary study site is the Rio Blanco Watershed in Luquillo National Forest, Puerto Rico. The river network has a region in which the rivers are very steep, and this region is downstream from the high elevation parts of the watershed that are less steep. The steep parts of the river are thought to have formed following a tectonic event four million years ago. Past studies have hypothesized that erosion rates in the steep river reaches are tied to the size of sediment carried in the river, with coarser sediment being required for river erosion. This sediment comes primarily from hillslopes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We focused our research in three areas: 1. building software to predict the size of sediment that is transported from hillslopes to channels; 2. building software to predict how the sediment size in rivers affects erosion rate; and 3. exploring the conditions that can cause rivers to move laterally or change their flow direction. As part of the broader impacts, we developed a service-learning course in which Tulane undergraduate students designed lesson plans to teach visually impaired elementary school kids about earth science concepts. Tulane students used the campus Scot Ackerman MakerSpace to make 3D models of the earth that they used in their lessons. Tulane students taught their lessons in community schools and during community weekend science events (Figure 1 shows Tulane students working with community children.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. We developed a computer model that predicts the sediment sizes produced from chemical weathering of rock into soil and applied it in the Rio Blanco Watershed. We found that the conditions in the study watershed do not produce coarse sediment in the soil. Measurements of the sediment sizes in soil agree with these model predictions. Figure 2A is a representative photo of a soil pit in our study area with very little coarse sediment. Figure 2B shows our team sieving soil to sort out coarse sediment. Despite the lack of coarse sediment in the soil, we observe coarse sediment in the rivers. We hypothesize that coarse sediment comes from landslides. Figure 3A is a photo of a landslide scarp, or the top of the area eroded by a landslide. Coarse sediment is uncovered beneath the landslide eroded area, and we observed coarse sediment in the landslide deposit downslope (Figure 3B). Further testing of our computer model shows that coarse sediment is only predicted in soil formed in locations that are drier, colder, and eroding faster than our study area.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. We built a computer model to predict river erosion rate into bedrock. We built this model within a larger open source land surface modeling framework called Landlab. The computer model implements a previously developed model, but takes it from 1D to 2D, and makes the model more accessible by building it in Landlab. We validated all 1D Landlab model results in comparison with the previously developed 1D model. We are building sample cases to illustrate the capabilities of the 2D model. Ultimately, we plan to link the hillslope sediment size model described above with the bedrock river incision model.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. To further understand the linkages between hillslopes and rivers, we looked beyond Rio Blanco at other watersheds in Puerto Rico. This exploration led us to Rio de la Plata, which appears to have changed flow direction from south to north draining. We hypothesize that the same tectonic event that impacted the Rio Blanco four million years ago caused river reversal in Rio de la Plata. We quantified different aspects of the landscape to support the hypothesis of river reversal. In support of this, we performed theoretical landscape modeling experiments to explore how landslides can lead to river network changes. We found that the mobility of a river network depends on the frequency of landslides.</p>\n<p>Finally, this grant supported a Tulane PhD student to participate in the NSF INTERN program. The student interned at UNESCO in Nairobi, Kenya. His work primarily focused on water availability for displaced and migrant people. He wrote grants, gave presentations, and managed projects, greatly strengthening his professional skills and network.
