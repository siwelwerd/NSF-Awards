 "awd_abstract_narration": "The magnetic field of the Earth and other planetary bodies is generated by the turbulent flow of conducting fluids in their deep interiors. In the Earth, it is generated by the outer core, made of liquid iron with some nickel and light elements. Earth's magnetic field is important, as life may not exist without its shielding of the solar wind. Moreover, the heat rising from the core fuels mantle thermal convection, at the origin of plate tectonics and associated hazards. Understanding Earth's magnetic field and core heat flow requires detailed knowledge of iron-rich material properties at the extreme pressures and temperatures of the core. Yet, existing experimental data and theoretical calculations are inconsistent. Here, the multidisciplinary team investigates  the thermal and electrical conductivities of iron alloys at extreme conditions. They use a combination of state-of-the-art experiments, theory, and modeling at both the atomic scale and the scale of the core. Expected results should reconcile experiments and modeling of the core's heat transport and magnetic field evolution. This project supports one graduate student and two postdoctoral associates in the field of Mineral Physics. It has strong implications for Geomagnetism, Geodynamics and Seismology, and broad impacts in Materials Science.\r\n\r\nHigh-pressure and temperature experiments are carried out in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell.  Extreme pressures and temperatures are generated at the tips of two opposing diamonds, where the iron sample is placed. The team will measure and compute electrical and thermal conductivities at conditions relevant to the core. This allows them to test the applicability of the Wiedemann-Franz law at these conditions. This empirical law relates thermal and electrical conductivities in metals. Here, the electrical conductivity is measured using a four-probe electrical connection brought outside from the cell. Thermal conductivity is measured by optical spectroradiometry in conjunction with pulsed-laser heating and modeling. Similar conditions are simulated using first-principles quantum mechanics to compute the electrical and thermal conductivity in liquid and solid iron, and compare them with experimental observations. These calculations are difficult because they involve the scattering of electrons off each other and off the moving atoms in the fluid or solid. Experimental and theoretical results are used in geophysical models of core cooling and magnetic field generation.  This will allow to better constrain the history of Earth's magnetic field and the heat flow at the core-mantle boundary.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
