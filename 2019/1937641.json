 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalysts are key materials used to accelerate and improve the energy efficiency of many processes for manufacturing fuels and chemicals. The project investigates a new concept - dynamic catalyst modulation - for further accelerating the rates of catalytic reactions, with corresponding improvements in energy utilization and reduced capital costs of process equipment.  If successful, the concept is potentially applicable to a wide range of industrial catalytic processes.  The investigators will incorporate the principles of dynamic catalyst modulation into various educational media.\r\n\r\nThe catalytic activity of materials is dictated by the binding energetics of key reaction intermediates, described through energy scaling relationships, which predicts a maximum in the catalytic activity - characterized by the well-known Sabatier principle - achievable only through material design. The study will investigate the extent to which field-effect modulation can be used to induce periodic oscillations in applied potential, on the timescale of turnover events, that alter the binding energetics of nickel oxide catalyst films on back-gated devices.  Operating catalysts under a constantly oscillating applied potential, where binding energetics of reaction intermediates are constantly changing, allows a single catalyst to mimic the performance of multiple materials in a periodic fashion. Altering the Fermi level will allow for the design of catalysts that break past the current limitations imposed by scaling relationships, to reach unprecedented levels of catalytic activity. The variation in binding energy of a carbon monoxide and oxygen on nickel oxide model system as a function of temperature and back-gate voltage will be characterized to determine carbon monoxide oxidation kinetics as a function of back gate voltage at steady state and oscillatory conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe field of catalysis has historically relied on structure-function relationships for catalyst design.  To achieve the function of chemical reaction control, catalysis scientists design a precise nanoparticle structure to achieve that behavior.  This has led to significant advances in the acceleration and control of many important reactions in the past three decades, but many important reactions remain too slow and unselective for commercial application.\n\n               In this work, we have pursued an alternative approach to catalyst design whereby catalysts are prepared as thin films on a device platform that enables charge injection (electrons or holes) to the active site of the catalyst where chemistry occurs. The injected \u2018bias\u2019 charge then changes the performance of the catalyst as a tunable quantity with precise amounts of charge injection on a continuum of options.  Here, we synthesized and characterized metal oxide films with this capability, and then we demonstrated that charge injection could significantly enhance the rate of a probe dehydration reaction along a continuum of charge injection conditions (i.e., variable applied voltage). \n\nThis opens up the possibility of optimizing catalysts to the precise conditions that yield the highest rates.  It also makes possible for the first time the possibility of changing the catalyst on the time scale of the catalytic reaction.  While the reaction is proceeding, the catalyst surface can be biased to benefit different parts of the reaction and accelerate the overall reaction rate.  All of this is now possible with the device that we have demonstrated with this work.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul Dauenhauer"
