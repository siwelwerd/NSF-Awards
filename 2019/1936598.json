 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will investigate a new class of miniature magnetic devices that can focus beams of electrons, similar to the way that lenses focus light.  Magnetic fields are highly effective for focusing beams of electrons, but current magnets are bulky and expensive. The proposed work aspires to create a new class of magnetic focusing devices that are at least one hundred times smaller than their existing counterparts. Steering electron beams has a broad range of applications.  They are used in the world's most powerful microscopes, free electron lasers, which can study the motion of individual atoms.  These laser microscopes can provide insight into the fundamental behavior of atoms and molecules, which can have impact in everyday life, such as discovery of new drugs. Additionally, electron beams are also used in treating cancer, with electron beam therapy having the benefit that it can be targeted much more precisely than radiation therapy. Miniaturizing magnetic focusing devices would not only allow broader access to these electron beams for use as laser microscopes, it would also allow electron beams to be put into places previously inaccessible, such as catheters for cancer therapy. The fundamental issues that will be studied in this work are the limits of miniaturization of these devices (i.e., how small can these magnets be made while still effectively focusing electron beams).  To address the challenge of miniaturization, new designs, fundamentally different from the current state-of-the-art, must be pursued. Fabrication of these devices will require a combination of methods currently used by microchip manufacturers with custom methods developed especially for this work.  Students at universities will be able to perform hands-on experiments that were previously limited to beamline scientists at a handful of facilities. The proposed activities will include being a faculty lead for \"Santa Monica College/UCLA\" Summer Scholar Research Program, development of high-school curriculum on magnetic devices, writing one article per year covering women in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nTo provide more detail, the proposed research will create a new class of microfabricated electromagnet quadrupoles for focusing electron beams. Electron beams have made profound impacts in many application areas, ranging from the world's most precise microscopes to targeted ablation of cancer. Until recently, all these applications relied on large, expensive pieces of laboratory equipment to generate and accelerate electron beams. For example, storage rings and linear coherent light sources that allow for imaging with unprecedented temporal (femtosecond) and spatial (Angstrom) resolution are often housed in facilities on the scale of kilometers. Recent advances have enabled centimeter-scale accelerators on-chip with the potential to accelerate electron beams to relativistic velocities, comparable to those at kilometer-scale facilities. While these results are promising, there remains a critical barrier: there is currently no chip-scale method that can focus the beams produced by these next-generation accelerators. Inspired by asymmetric quadrupoles, which use magnetic field gradients to focus electron beams in a rectangular aperture, this work proposes to design, fabricate, and characterize a new class of miniature rectangular quadrupoles. However, the large-scale rectangular quadrupoles cannot simply be directly miniaturized. New designs must be developed to adapt to the fabrication constraints particular to small scale fabrication, and new fabrication methods must be developed to build devices at a mesoscale size range that falls between the regions where microfabrication and standard fabrication can comfortably operate. The proposed devices will provide 20 times greater focusing gradient and fit in a volume seven orders of magnitude smaller than the current state-of-the-art rectangular quadrupoles. If successful, this will be the first-ever focusing demonstration of a relativistic electron beam using a chip-scale device.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nElectron bunches traveling near the speed of light (\"electron beams\") have uses ranging from the world\u2019s most powerful microscopes, called free electron lasers, to precision ablation of cancerous cells.  Substantial advances in understanding the complex physics underlying electron beam physics have occurred in recent decades, enabling the impact they have had thus far.  However, there remains an unconquered challenge that is preventing electron beams from having even more impact on our daily lives, and that challenge is the devices needed to control these electrons are too large to be more widely used. \n\nWhen we have a beam of light and want to focus or steer it in some way, we use a device called a lens.  Beams of electrons are also controlled by something called a lens, except that lenses for electrons are not made of glass or some other solid substance, but rather of magnetic fields.  The devices that provide these fields are currently large and can easily weigh 100 pounds. In this project, these devices have been miniaturized to something that can easily fit in the palm of someone\u2019s hand. \n\n In order to miniaturize these electron \"lenses\", our research team used a combination of existing microfabrication processes &ndash; similar to those used to make the microchips in your phone &ndash; along with new techniques we developed to deposit high quality magnetic materials at small scales.  The result was a miniature version of the Panofsky quadrupole, which is a device that focus a beam of electrons with a wide, flat profile, although our device was not just a shrunk down version of the original Panofsky quadrupole.  We completely rethought the design of our device compared to the conventional Panofsky quadrupole for two reasons.  First, building things at small scales provides a different set of constraints compared to large scale manufacturing.  Second, the relative size scales we work at allow for exploration of new design ideas that might not work in the conventional size scales.  The result of this work was a miniature Panofsky quadrupole that was shown to effectively focus beams of electrons traveling more than 99% the speed of light.  This work marks an advance toward miniaturizing the systems that steer beams of electrons, taking us closer to the goal of allowing the potential of electron beams to touch more lives through scientific discovery and medicine.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/11/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert N Candler"
