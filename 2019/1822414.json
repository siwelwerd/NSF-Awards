 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing student?s quantitative reasoning skills is essential for training numerically literate citizens who can flourish in an increasingly data-driven world. A growing body of literature suggests that including quantitative reasoning courses in different disciplines throughout a curriculum may help students to better learn quantitative reasoning. As a part of the Catalyst general education curriculum at Ripon College, all first-year students enroll in Catalyst 120: Quantitative Reasoning. By design, this course has a common set of learning outcomes and assignments, but is taught by faculty in different disciplines, including Biology, Theatre, Psychology, and Communication. This project aims to further examine the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary approach to teaching quantitative reasoning. Specifically, the project will examine the role of specific faculty professional development strategies for improving the ability of faculty at a small liberal arts college to teach quantitative reasoning. Project leaders will corporate professional development activities for faculty members and study the effectiveness of these activities for helping faculty teach quantitative reasoning.  Thus, the project may develop an evidence-based model that other institutions could use to implement robust quantitative reasoning across disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis project is designed to develop and study the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary approach to teaching quantitative reasoning as well as the impact of increasing institutional capacity to provide this instruction through communities of practice. During the first two years, project leaders will initiate a series of Faculty Learning Communities to further develop faculty expertise in teaching quantitative reasoning using evidence-based pedagogies, to create innovative quantitative reasoning materials in a variety of disciplines, and to put these materials into practice in their Catalyst curriculum. In the third year, the project team will work with several faculty members in non-quantitative disciplines to create quantitatively focused courses within their fields. A validated quantitative reasoning instrument will be used to measure student learning gains, and members of the project team will create a new tool for evaluating interdisciplinary quantitative skills. The project team expects that comprehensive institutional change will result from this project and will study this change through faculty surveys, interviews, and review of curricular materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nBackground\n Quantitative Reasoning (QR) skills are critical for students to succeed in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields and to be educated members of a STEM-literate workforce. Our project leveraged the institutional and curricular strengths of Ripon College, a small liberal arts school in rural Wisconsin, and in particular, that institution\u2019s uniquely multidisciplinary approach to QR instruction. The overarching aim of the project was to broaden institutional capacity for teaching QR by developing faculty expertise across disciplines, including in non-quantitative fields, and to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.\n\n \nNot long before grant activities began, the faculty at Ripon College implemented the skills-based Catalyst general education curriculum.   This curriculum revolves around a set of five courses, required for all students and taught by faculty from a wide variety of disciplines.  QR is the primary focus of one of these courses. A unique feature of the Catalyst curriculum is that each course has a shared set of learning goals and assignments but is taught by faculty from different disciplines. This provides students with the opportunity to use QR skills within disciplinary contexts and allows for broad transferability of these skills. However, it also yields a challenge, as faculty have different levels of expertise in teaching QR.\n\n \nOver three years, we used a series of Faculty Learning Communities (FLC) to further develop faculty expertise in teaching QR using evidence-based pedagogies, to create innovative QR materials in a variety of disciplines, and to put these materials into practice in our Catalyst curriculum. We also worked with faculty members in non-quantitative disciplines to create QR-related materials for courses in their disciplines.  A total of 22 faculty members participated in one or more FLCs&ndash;over one-third of the faculty at the College.\n\n \nOutcomes\nOur  project clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of creating a community of practice surrounding the teaching of QR.  Moreover, by deliberately including both quantitatively and non-quantitatively focused faculty members, and by doing so in the context of a QR course required for all students at the college, our project provides guidance for other colleges who wish to strengthen their own multidisciplinary QR programs.  \n\n \nThe impacts of the project at Ripon College, as measured by surveys and interviews, are significant, and since such a large proportion of the faculty were involved, we expect those impacts to spread over time.  The project provided a wide variety of faculty development opportunities, ranging from designing course guidelines to using software to create graphical representations of data, and there is clear evidence that institutional capacity to teach QR increased at Ripon.  There is also evidence that students benefited from multidisciplinary approaches to teaching QR, and specifically from the transfer of ideas among FLC participants.    \nSpecific results include\n\n\nStrong, if anecdotal, indications that students respond well to QR instruction with multiple disciplinary influences.\n\n\nStatistically significant gains for faculty in\n\n\nConfidence in their ability to teach QR.\n\n\nInterest in QR (as measured by likelihood of attending QR-related sessions at conferences).\n\n\n\n\nEvidence of skill development across the curriculum: students who took courses with multiple FLC participants transferred QR skills between courses.\n\n\nObservations&ndash;based on interviews and written reflections&ndash;to guide other institutions who plan to use FLCs to improve their capacity to teach QR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mckenzie Lamb"
