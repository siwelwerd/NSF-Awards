 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award will support the establishment of a network of operations researchers and a science plan to address cross-cutting methodological challenges in hazards and disaster research.  An abiding challenge for decision making in the context of hazards and disasters derives from the need to provide prescriptive (decisional) guidance under dynamic conditions of sometimes profound uncertainty and risk. Addressing these challenge requires a renewed focus on identifying potentially high-impact research problems that lie beyond the boundary of existing disciplinary and interdisciplinary methods to address. This is particularly true for problems that involve large-scale, sometimes sustained interaction between human-machine systems and hazard-related phenomena within a broader policy and social context.\r\n        \r\n        This project will establish the Operations and Systems Engineering Extreme Event Research (OSEEER) network, designed to marshal both traditional and non-traditional sources of expertise in order to accomplish three main objectives:  first, to create and sustain a network of researchers, collaborators and other affiliates working within and across operations engineering-centered areas; second, to stimulate this network through workshops and early-stage research activities in order to define high-impact, methodologically challenging problems in the field in the domain of hazards and disasters; and third, to develop publications and other outputs that establish preliminary research results and an agenda for future work to address emerging challenges that will contribute to society's ability to mitigate, respond to and learn from hazards and disasters.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
