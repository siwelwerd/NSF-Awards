 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most exciting new ideas in geochemistry is to measure two rare isotopes in calcium carbonate instead of just one and \"clump\" them together.  This provides a new and powerful tool to study the temperature of ancient oceans and sediments and will help scientists looking at climate change, plate tectonics, and petroleum exploration. This study will help identify the calcium carbonate minerals most likely to preserve ancient temperatures.  It will also provide the chemical information needed to use two minerals at the same time to better estimate the temperature history of the rocks. This project will develop this new tool by connecting atom-level processes with observed chemical reactions. The study will improve temperature estimates of ancient oceans and the temperature history of rocks related to petroleum reservoirs.  The project will train graduate and undergraduate students and will add a new section of a capstone undergraduate course that will introduce seniors to the field. The project will also engage chemistry graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups\r\n\r\nOne of the most exciting developments in geochemistry in the 21st century is the ability to measure the relative abundance of molecules with two rare isotopes (\"clumped isotopes\") in calcium carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite) and apply this technique to reveal the temperatures of ancient oceans or the burial temperatures of sediments now exposed at the surface.  A major complication in clumped isotope paleothermometry however is reequilibration (reordering) of the signatures at elevated temperatures (>100oC) on million-year timescales. While complicating paleoclimate studies, this reordering provides great potential for measuring rates of burial, uplift, and exhumation of geologic formations, but only if the rates (kinetics) of reordering are well understood. Currently, only the reordering kinetics of the mineral calcite (CaCO3) has been studied in detail. To address this knowledge gap, experiments will be conducted in which different minerals are heated and the rate at which they reorder is measured. The mechanisms of clumped isotope reordering will be examined at an atomistic level using a range of sophisticated chemical techniques such as programmable heated-stage synchrotron X-ray diffraction, total scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy, in conjunction with advanced models for atomic bonding. Correlating atomic characteristics with kinetic parameters and mineralogical characterization will allow determination of detailed equations governing the rates of reordering in a variety of carbonate minerals.  The project will train graduate and undergraduate students and will add a new section of a capstone undergraduate course that will introduce seniors to the field. The project will also engage chemistry graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

One of the most promising techniques for measuring ancient ocean temperatures is based on the co-enrichment of rare heavy carbon and heavy oxygen isotopes (*termed <em>clumped isotopes</em>) in calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) like that of fossil shells.&nbsp; Unfortunately, such <em>paleotemperature</em> determinations made using fossil shells can be <em>reset</em> when sediments, buried by younger sediments, are exposed to higher temperatures at depth in the Earth. Our study examines the factors controlling the rate of this clumped isotope resetting (termed <em>reordering</em>) using experimental and theoretical methods. These efforts to better quantify rates of clumped isotope reordering will lead to more accurate knowledge of ocean temperature extremes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our experiments started with the synthesis of mineral powders in the laboratory (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). These powders were then heated at temperatures as high as 385 ?C (725 ?F) for different durations up to 96 hours and measured for alteration of the original clumped isotope composition (<strong>Figure 2</strong>).&nbsp; The samples were carbonate minerals with either trigonal structure (calcite, CaCO<sub>3</sub>) or rhombohedral structure (aragonite, CaCO<sub>3</sub>; strontianite, SrCO<sub>3</sub>; witherite, BaCO<sub>3</sub>). Experiments yielded the following progression of reordering rates, from fastest to slowest: strontianite, witherite, aragonite, and calcite (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). These experiments demonstrate the importance of crystal structure (specifically, the connectivity between atoms in minerals) and chemical composition in controlling clumped isotope reordering.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In concert with the experiments, we attempted to simulate the reordering process on supercomputers considering interactions of electrons, atoms, and molecules at the atomic level. The approaches used, density functional theory (DFT) and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), permit testing of the effect of chemical impurities in the mineral structure, especially water, on clumped isotope reordering. Such tests can help validate trends in experimental data and direct future experiments. Furthermore, theoretical models provide an atomistic view of possible movements of heavy oxygen atoms in the crystal structure, revealing the structural changes preceding clumped isotope reordering. Rearrangements in the connectivity of atoms across multiple possible transition states is examined to decipher the most likely pathway for reordering. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First-principles simulations reveal that substitution of magnesium and water in the calcite structure facilitated clumped isotope reordering by lowering the energy needed for exchange of heavy oxygen between CaCO<sub>3</sub> molecules. The steps involved in water-mediated oxygen diffusion are shown in <strong>Figure 4</strong>.&nbsp; We also discovered a bi-tetrahedral intermediate structure involved in oxygen exchange between molecules (<strong>Figure 5</strong>). Lastly, AIMD models show that the free energy changes required to reach the transition state for oxygen exchange follow the experimentally-determined sequence of clumped isotope reordering (from fastest to slowest): strontianite, witherite, and calcite.&nbsp; These results will help scientists identify the best fossils for paleotemperature studies and thus produce more accurate reconstructions of ancient ocean temperatures, setting constraints on modern global warming.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This study has broader impacts beyond providing valuable insight into a process important for measurement of ancient ocean temperatures. Accurate clumped isotope reordering rates are also essential for the application of clumped isotopes to reconstruct the thermal histories of sedimentary basins, information critical for petroleum exploration. Several graduate students have worked on different aspects of cross-disciplinary study, learning and exchanging knowledge in isotope geochemistry, experimental geochemistry, mass spectrometry, density functional theory, and molecular dynamics.&nbsp; The results of this study have resulted in four presentations at national and international conferences, and two manuscripts (one in press and one in revision).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>*Isotopes are atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. In our study, the rare heavy isotopes are oxygen-18 and carbon-13, whereas the common light isotopes are oxygen-16 and carbon-12. Thus, for clumped isotopes we measure the relative abundance of Ca<sup>13</sup>C<sup>18</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/31/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ethan&nbsp;L&nbsp;Grossman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1915647/1915647_10625897_1685506582794_Outcome-Figure-3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1915647/1915647_10625897_1685506582794_Outcome-Figure-3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1915647/1915647_10625897_1685506582794_Outcome-Figure-3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 3.
