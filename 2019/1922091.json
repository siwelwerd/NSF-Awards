 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support to U.S. based participants at a conference titled \"Combinatorial and Algebraic Aspects of Geometric Structures\" which will be held July 22 through July 26, 2019 at Chiang Mai University, in Chiang Mai, Thailand.  This conference aims to build on existing collaborations between researchers at the University of Illinois, Chiang Mai University, National University of Singapore, and the University of Luxembourg, and more broadly from Europe, Asia, and North America. The conference will include general research talks and mini-course lectures aimed at graduate students and postdocs, as well as five-minute lightning talks by graduate students and postdocs, providing them an opportunity to share their research and spark conversations with other participants.  The venue will provide the opportunity for US researchers to make new connections with their counterparts from European and Asian countries, in particular those from the latter countries for whom it may not be feasible to travel internationally.\r\n\r\n \r\nThe theme of the conference, as the title suggests, is quite broad and involves topics such as geometric structures on manifolds, including hyperbolic and flat structures on surfaces, exotic geometric structures arising from representations into other Lie groups, and coarse geometric structures arising from geometric group theory.  The speakers are chosen to represent a coherent mix of topics from this list, to maximize the potential for new collaborations and cross-fertilization of areas.  For example, Maloni's research is in both hyperbolic and mixed-signature geometric structures meshes very well with Bridgeman and Canary's work on higher Teichmueller theory as well as hyperbolic geometry.  Existing collaborations between the PI and researchers from Chiang Mai, Thailand, Singapore, and Luxembourg, as well as collaborations between researchers from those locations, will also provide a starting point for new collaborations.  Additional details about the conference can be found on the conference website: http://www.math.science.cmu.ac.th/lst/index.php\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This is a report on the activities associated to the workshop on Combinatorial and Algebraic Aspects of Geometric Structures that ran from July 22 through July 25, 2019, at Chiang Mai University in Chiang Mai, Thailand.  The workshop was organized by Pradthana Jaipong (Thailand), Sang-hyun Kim (Korea), Christopher Leininger (PI, USA), Hugo Parlier (Luxembourg), Supaluk Phothi (Thailand), Jean-Marc Schlenker (Luxembourg), Ser-Peow Tan (Singapore), and Tengren Zhang (Singapore), who were in attendance for the workshop.  There were approximately 80 participants from around the world, including graduate students, postdocs, junior and senior faculty.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual Merit: The aim of the workshop was to strengthen and unify existing collaborations between researchers from the USA, Europe, and Asia, as well as building new collaborations, and generally promoting US mathematics.  The mathematical focus of the workshop was quite broad, and included the classical study of geometric structures on surfaces such as \"hyperbolic structures\" as well as \"combinatorial structures\" (e.g. through curves on surfaces); extensions to ``infinite type\" surfaces, and expansions to higher dimensional analogues (specifically, ``higher Teichmueller theory''). \n\nThere were 12 high level research lectures by both senior and junior mathematicians, 4 minicourse lectures given by upcoming stars in the field, and 17 five minute ``lightning talks\" by the next generation of mathematicians.  Between the talks there was ample opportunity for developing connections and beginning new collaborations, with discussions during the breaks frequently lasting until the start of the next lecture, as well as into the evenings.\n\nBroader Impacts: This workshop provided the opportunity for PhD students and young mathematicians to present their work to experts in the field, primarily through the lightning talks, and sparked numerous conversations with the potential for future collaborations between junior and senior mathematicians.  The minicourses and research lectures were also educational, informing young researchers about both classical results and current research trends that were outside their own expertise.  Finally, the workshop provided an opportunity for young researchers to learn about mathematics in a culture many would not otherwise experience, providing a broader world view. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher J Leininger"
