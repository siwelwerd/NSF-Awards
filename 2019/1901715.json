 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the explicit goals of the NeuroNex Program is to provide added value to NSF investments in the BRAIN Initiative by building a community of researchers who are committed to the continued development and dissemination of neurotechnologies and theoretical approaches to the broad neuroscience community. Such community building/expansion ensures that the innovative imaging, recording and genetic manipulation methods that are being developed as part of the BRAIN Initiative are accessible to the broadest possible spectrum of neuroscientists. Furthermore, it allows the neurotechnology developers to expand the repertoire of tools to interrogate brain and behavior in organisms more diverse than the limited set of model organisms that the tools were developed originally. The organizers are making a strong effort to invite women and members of underrepresented groups as participants. Further, the meeting entails extensive cross-disciplinary interactions, which will be aided greatly by the face-to-face nature of this meeting. Importantly, this workshop is part of a concerted effort to coordinate and align interagency priorities to capitalize on cross-disciplinary technology developments to approach perhaps the greatest scientific challenge of the time ? understanding the brain.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how behavior emerges from the dynamic patterns of electrical and chemical activity of brain circuits is universally recognized as a fundamental mystery in science. The BRAIN Initiative was created in 2014 to catalyze national efforts towards the development of neurotechnologies that are aimed at a fuller understanding of the brain. To support for research activities related to interagency BRAIN Initiative as directed by the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (Public Law 114-329), NSF created the NeuroNex activity to ensure the continued development and broad dissemination of these innovative neurotechnologies. As part of this activity, 9 Neurotechnology Hubs, 2 Neurotheory teams and six Innovation awards were funded in FY2017. This workshop aims to bring together the principal investigators and their trainees for an inaugural awardees meeting. Funds are requested for a one-and-half day meeting to coincide with the Annual Society for Neuroscience Meeting with the following goals: 1) Present updates and highlights of progress into tools, technologies and theories, 2) Identify key issues and bottlenecks in technology development, 3) Discuss opportunities, barriers and challenges for widespread dissemination and community engagement 4) Leverage synergies between the different projects to push forward new and emerging areas and 5) Continue to build a national research infrastructure that allows teams to quickly re-configure in response to research challenges/opportunities. The participants will discuss these issues in small thematic groups, and will use their insights to generate a coherent set of strategies and obectives towards the goals of the NeuroNex program and the BRAIN Initiative.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
