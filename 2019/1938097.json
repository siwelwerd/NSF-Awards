The primary goal of this project is to research the incorporation of ancestral knowledge systems and CSE as disciplines that co-create positive learning ecologies for marginalized communities, especially women of color, towards sustainable computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
