 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individuals with serious mental illnesses (SMI), such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are more likely to be arrested and incarcerated than those without SMI. Their arrests are often for non-violent, misdemeanor \"quality of life\" and \"public nuisance\" charges. Such arrests and incarcerations interfere with treatment and recovery. This problem of \"criminalization\" of individuals with SMI is widely recognized, and programs are being put in place to try to reduce arrests that are not necessary, and instead refer these individuals to mental health treatment services. Despite nationwide efforts to develop models of \"pre-arrest jail diversion\" (i.e., diverting from the criminal justice system to the mental health system), research has yet to identify which misdemeanor charges are most over-represented among persons with SMI. Effective pre-arrest jail diversion programs--to address the problem of over-representation of persons with SMI in jails--will only be effective if we understand the use and prosecution of the most commonly applied misdemeanor charges.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to study the implementation, meaning, and use of particular laws/charges and how they contribute to the over-representation of persons with SMI in the criminal justice system. The project will consist of a multi-site (Atlanta, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia), mixed-methods study. Specifically, the research team will first analyze two different datasets (one administrative, and one clinical) to identify the 2-5 misdemeanor charges that appear to be most over-represented among individuals with SMI. Next, the team will carry out four \"systems mapping exercises\" in the four different cities in order to understand the use and processing of these specific misdemeanor charges in different settings. Then, the investigators will conduct three focus groups in each of the four cities (12 in total) to gain a rich, in-depth understanding of the use of these charges. The project will create an explanatory theory to understand how police officers, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges understand, apply, make use of, potentially over-use, or rely upon certain types of misdemeanor charges among individuals with SMI. Such an explanatory theory will serve as a foundation for further, definitive research, as well as policy and program development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We obtained outcomes regarding four research questions.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">What misdemeanor charges are overrepresented and/or common among people with SMI?</span> We analyzed two existing datasets and obtained quantitative results. First, we analyzed the Record of Arrest and Prosecution sheets from a sample of 240 patients with SMI in southeast Georgia to characterize the nature of lifetime arrests and charges. Results suggest that the ways in which people with SMI become caught up in the criminal legal system, and stay in the system, are complex and time-variant, and accumulate from decisions made by a variety of actors across the criminal legal system. Second, we analyzed a New York State administrative dataset to explore the specific types of charges that are most common among arrests involving individuals with SMI. Results show that while some charges were common among individuals with or without an SMI indicator, other charges were unique. Specifically, while charges related to driving under the influence of alcohol were among the most common charges in arrests involving those without the indicator, criminal trespass is clearly an over-represented charge among people with an SMI indicator and is often used simply to resolve situations (e.g., needing a space that provides shelter or subsistence). Taken together, these results point to a pattern of mostly non-violent and relatively minor misdemeanor offending among people with mental illnesses. Figure 1 shows the common charges among arrests involving individuals with SMI.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How do individuals with SMI charged with minor misdemeanors enter and travel through the criminal legal system?</span> The research team conducted a system mapping exercise with professionals in both the criminal legal system and behavioral health services in Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York City. Results revealed structural differences across the four sites in terms of how systems are organized and how they have created ?off ramps? to better address the needs of people with SMI. At the same time, our results demonstrated that stakeholders across these jurisdictions also face familiar contexts that influence their decisions and shape what is possible in terms of identifying and addressing mental health needs. These contexts include the following: (1) the law and policy environment that includes formal laws but also encapsulates a dynamic environment that is responsive to contingent events (e.g., COVID-19); (2) the location of a behavior in terms of the place-based context of the behavior and the social norms operating in that place; (3) the expectations of stakeholders including complainants (e.g., businesses and community interest groups) as well as defendants that can exert pressure on how the criminal legal system intervenes; (4) the knowledge that different decision-makers have about mental illness (both clinical and experiential knowledge) and how such knowledge may or may not flow across the continuum of criminal legal decision-making; and (5) the existing access to community resources including mental health services. Figure 2 illustrates the context that shape the process of misdemeanor charges involving individuals with SMI.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">When and why are specific misdemeanor charges used?</span> Building on the system maps created in each jurisdiction, we conducted 17 focus groups and in-depth interviews that included 94 individuals. Three findings are noteworthy. First, although stakeholders agreed that the types of behavior frequently leading to the misdemeanor charges of interest are common among people with SMI, social disadvantages rather than mental illness were understood as the explanatory factor for these behaviors. Second, stakeholders across criminal legal and behavioral health systems in all four sites articulated a common commitment to reducing the disproportionate contact that people with SMI have with the criminal legal system. Third, there is little agreement on how to achieve the common goal of reducing the harmful involvement of the criminal legal system in the lives of people with SMI and advancing justice and equity in criminal legal decision-making. Figure 3 illustrates the decision makers involved.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">What explains misdemeanor system over-involvement among people with SMI?</span> Based on the above three outcomes, we developed an explanatory theory that describes how misdemeanor systems interpret and enforce the criminal law in the lives of people with SMI. Figure 4 illustrates that misdemeanor interventions among people with mental illnesses are shaped by various decision-making contexts and values. In response to a behavior or incident the criminal legal system intervenes via different points of intervention involving the decisions of different actors, including police, prosecutors, and judges. For the day-to-day work of criminal legal system professionals, such as theory suggests that facilitating change that advances justice and equity in legal decision-making requires viewing decisions from a systems perspective and better aligning decision-makers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/24/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;T&nbsp;Compton</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920902/1920902_10632875_1647046504542_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920902/1920902_10632875_1647046504542_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Contexts shaping misdemeanor interventions among people with SMI\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920902/1920902_10632875_1647046504542_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Contexts shaping misdemeanor interventions among people with SMI\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Misdemeanor interventions among people with mental illnesses are shaped by various decision-making contexts and values.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Compton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;T&nbsp;Compton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Contexts shaping misdemeanor interventions among people with SMI</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920902/1920902_10632875_1647046137939_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920902/1920902_10632875_1647046137939_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Context shaping misdemeanor system decision-making\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920902/1920902_10632875_1647046137939_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Context shaping misdemeanor system decision-making\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Misdemeanor charges decision making occur across the continuum of the system adn within multiple, dynamic contexts.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Compton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;T&nbsp;Compton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Context shaping misdemeanor system decision-making</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920902/1920902_10632875_1647046380329_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920902/1920902_10632875_1647046380329_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Focal concerns and value pluralism among stakeholders\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920902/1920902_10632875_1647046380329_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Focal concerns and value pluralism among stakeholders\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">There is little agreement among stakeholders on how to achieve the common goal of reducing the harmful involvement of the criminal legal system in the lives of people with SMI and advancing justice and equity in criminal legal decision-making.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Compton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;T&nbsp;Compton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Focal concerns and value pluralism among stakeholders</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920902/1920902_10632875_1647617761637_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920902/1920902_10632875_1647617761637_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Common charges\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1920902/1920902_10632875_1647617761637_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Common charges\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ranking of the 15 Most Common Charges from the Earliest Two Arrests and the Most Recent Two Arrests among Individuals with Serious Mental Illnesses Who Had Been Arrested at Least Four Times in Georgia</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Compton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;T&nbsp;Compton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Common charges</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
