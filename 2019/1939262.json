 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum information science is revolutionizing the way we approach both computation and basic science. The U.S. and Europe both have strong quantum information science programs. Historically, the programs have been distributed with small group investigators following their own research themes. Recently, a more organized, strategic approach to quantum information science has arisen. The European Union in 2018 started the Europe-wide Quantum Flagship project. The U.S. recently adopted the National Quantum Initiative to coordinate national quantum research efforts. Both initiatives identified key research themes in quantum networking, quantum metrology and sensing, and quantum computation and simulation. They have also prioritized training and education of students to work in this area. \r\n\r\nLeveraging the synergies of these strategic efforts, this award supports a U.S.-Europe workshop on research themes in quantum information in Washington, DC in September 2019. The workshop will bring together prominent researchers from around Europe and the U.S. to two days of intensive discussion on three key intellectual areas: quantum networking, quantum computation and simulation, and quantum sensing and metrology. The goal of the meeting is to identify common themes for cooperation, accelerating the rate of expansion in knowledge in these areas for the mutual benefit of U.S. and European societies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
