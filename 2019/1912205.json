 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a collaborative effort among the University of the District of Columbia, Bethune-Cookman University, and the University of Memphis. It will expand the development, implementation, and evaluation of a virtual STEM peer mentorship program for underrepresented minority women (UMW) undergraduate students. The goal is to examine the efficacy of a Virtual Peer Mentoring Program in developing culturally responsive mentorship leadership skills, STEM self-efficacy, and science identities among UMW students. In this project, graduate and senior-level undergraduate students will use a systematic process to mentor a group of freshman, sophomore, and junior undergraduate students in a virtual environment. Prior to engaging in the virtual mentoring relationship, mentors and mentees will be trained using case-based virtual training modules to socialize the mentors and mentees to the mentoring relationship and build skills in leadership, mentoring, and cultural responsiveness. The project will extend current research by identifying effective types of mentoring relationships and modes for these relationships in STEM degree programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and for underrepresented minority women students in general. It is expected to document the effectiveness of an intervention to increase STEM persistence for UMW undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThe overarching framework for the study combines persistence, self-efficacy, identity, and mentoring research theories. A multiphase mixed-method research approach will be used to answer the following research questions: (1) After participating in the virtual mentorship training, what changes, if any, do student mentors and mentees self-report in their STEM mentorship, leadership, and cultural responsiveness skills? (2) After participating in the Virtual STEM Peer Mentorship Program, what changes, if any, do student mentors and mentees self-report in their STEM self-efficacy from pretest to posttest survey as compared to a waitlist control group? How do student mentors and mentees believe the Virtual STEM Peer Mentorship Program is useful, if at all, in furthering their STEM self-efficacy?  (3) After participating in the Virtual STEM Peer Mentorship Program, what changes, if any, do student mentors and mentees self-report in their STEM identity from pretest to posttest survey as compared to a waitlist control group? How do student mentors and mentees believe the Virtual STEM Peer Mentorship Program is useful, if at all, in furthering their STEM identity? (4) How do student mentors and mentees persist, if at all, in their STEM degree program during the duration of the Virtual STEM Peer Mentorship Program?  After participating in the Virtual STEM Peer Mentorship Program, how do student mentors and mentees self-report intent to persist in their STEM degree programs and pursuit of a STEM career pathway? How, if at all, were the Virtual STEM Peer Mentorship Program components effective in supporting student mentors and mentees? intent to persist in a STEM degree program and, ultimately, in their intent to pursue a STEM career pathway?  The multiphase design will allow for examination of quantitative and qualitative data over time to answer the proposed research questions and assess the program objectives. This design allows for use of descriptive and randomized controlled trial designs for quantitative data collection and a case study lens for qualitative data collection. The proposed project will advance knowledge about the impact of mentoring in STEM education on persistence of UMW and produce an evidence-based strategy for student support. \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU-UP) program, Broadening Participation in STEM Education Research track, that focuses on the creation and investigation of new theory-driven models and innovations relevant to the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM education and the workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

An 8-module online peer mentoring training program was developed for peer mentees and the previously developed peer mentor training was extended from 6 to 8 modules total modules. The online training was developed with the intent to enhance the STEM self-efficacy, STEM identity, sense of belonging, mentoring competencies, cultural competencies, and intent to persist in STEM degree programs and careers of undergraduate and graduate participants. The overall project was grounded in theories of self-efficacy and motivation, with a primary grounding in Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT; Hackett, 1994). Each module in the training consisted of three main parts: topical discussion, case study, and personal application. Additionally, participants were encouraged to communicate with one another via an online platform during the training (the Slack platform) and participate in STEM Webinars where minoritized women with successful careers in STEM were featured. After completion of the online mentoring training, participants were organized into STEM Communities, which served as mentoring groups, and engaged in peer mentoring relationships. </span></p>\n<p><span>A total of 29 students (2 graduate students and 27 undergraduate students; 7 peer mentors and 22 peer mentees) participated in the project during the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters at two participating historically black institutions. </span></p>\n<p><span>Four measurable objectives and seven research questions were explored, centering on the impacts, if any, of participation in the program on students? STEM self-efficacy, STEM identity, sense of belonging, intent to persist in STEM degrees and careers, mentoring competencies, and cultural competencies. Data were collected via pre-tests and posttests administered at the beginning and ending of the program participation, which consisted of demographic and persistence questions as well as the following survey instruments: Mentoring Competencies Assessment (MCA; Fleming et al., 2013), STEM Self-Efficacy Scale (Rockinson-Szapkiw et al., 2021), and the Cross Cultural Mentoring Inventory Revised (CCMI, Suffrin et al., 2014). Data were also collected through individual interviews and focus groups held at the end of program participation. </span></p>\n<p><span>A series of Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests were conducted on the quantitative survey items (e.g., MCA, STEM Self-Efficacy Scale, CCMI), which indicated no statistically significant impact of the program on STEM self-efficacy, mentoring competencies, and cultural competencies. Using a case study design, qualitative data were analyzed using a combination of inductive and deductive coding and then organizing codes into themes. Salient themes were identified which indicated that participation in the program imparted positive impacts on participating students? STEM self-efficacy, recognition and embracing of intersecting identities, sense of belonging, intent to persist, mentoring competencies, and cultural competencies. Overall, student participants reported appreciation of and positive perceived benefits as a result of engaging in the peer mentoring training and noted skills attainment, diverse representation in the training, cultivation of a sense of belonging, and identification of intersecting identities as being especially noteworthy. Participants cited the design, organization, and nature of the online training modules and the opportunities to attend STEM Webinars as being especially beneficial to their outcomes. The majority of participants also cited participation in the STEM Communities (mentoring relationships) as being instrumental in developing a sense of belonging, enhancing STEM self-efficacy, and sustaining intent to persist. It should be noted that the project implementation occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, which prohibited student participants from interacting in the face-to-face environment. Thus, all training, mentoring, and other communications were completed in the virtual environment. Participants expressed the desire to include options for face-to-face components in future iterations of the project and the desire to communicate virtually via a different communication platform (e.g., other than the Slack platform). </span></p>\n<p><span>The findings of the project have enhanced the body of knowledge on peer mentoring among racially and ethnically minoritized students enrolled in STEM degree programs at HBCUs.
