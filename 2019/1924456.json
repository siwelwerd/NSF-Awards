 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is a large-scale redistribution of heat and freshwater that impacts weather and climate.  This project will use numerical models of the ocean circulation to examine the long record of observations from moorings deployed in the North Atlantic. The goals include diagnosing the mass, heat, and freshwater fluxes of the AMOC and assessing the relationships between observations of ocean properties at the moorings and ocean or atmospheric properties at other locations. The project will also determine the optimal mooring array design for observing the AMOC. The project includes outreach to middle and high school students entered around the North Atlantic Ocean and its unique role in climate.\r\n\r\nThis project will use a suite of ocean models, including the ECCO variational data assimilation model system, to examine the long time-series of observations from North Atlantic mooring arrays (including OSNAP and RAPID-MOCHA). The goals include: assimilation of Atlantic array data into global and regional ocean state estimates to assess the value they add to independent elements of the Global Ocean Observing System; diagnosing relationship of observed mass, heat and freshwater transport variability at the arrays to causal atmospheric forcing; identification of the potential for the array data to serve as proxies for remote, unobserved variables or indices of key oceanic and climatic relevance; and determining the optimal redesign of the OSNAP array for observing AMOC. The proposed research will complement ongoing major investments by NSF in observing the ocean role in climate through the AMOC and promises to ensure that future investments are as effective as possible.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The principal circulation feature that is responsible for this uptake, storage and distribution is the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).  Starting in 2014, the international ocean community has measured the AMOC in the subpolar North Atlantic on a continuous basis with an observing system that extends from the Labrador shelf to the Scottish shelf.  This international effort has been led by U.S. investigators with support from the Physical Oceanography Program at the National Science Foundation. The effort to date has elucidated many facets of the overturning circulation at high latitudes that would not have been known without direct observations.  Though the observing system is producing excellent data and leading us to a new understanding of the AMOC, it is an expensive effort, with instruments in the Labrador, Irminger and Iceland basins that measure the full depth of the water column.  This grant addressed whether we could 1) understand the drivers of the AMOC variability such that we could 2) design a more efficient and less costly observing system. Our investigations have revealed that the MOC lower limb in the subpolar North Atlantic has a complex circulation and changes in the full set of pathways combine to describe the MOC and its variability.

This distributed transformation is consistent with other analyses that suggest the full OSNAP array is needed to capture the full measure of the overturning.  However, our work also suggests that the arrays can be \"thinned\", meaning they can carry fewer moorings and/or instruments, without significantly compromising the signal of the variability.  We are using these results to design the next phase of OSNAP so that it is a cost-effective observing system that continues to yield a rich trove of data and advance our understanding of how the ocean will respond to and contribute to climate change.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/13/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Susan Lozier"
