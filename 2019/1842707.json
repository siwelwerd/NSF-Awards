 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will provide children ages 7-11 years with an interactive learning program that cultivates core leadership skills. This project goes deeper than many traditional socio-emotional programs by fortifying children with the behavioral skills and mindset they need to evolve as effective leaders. The educational curriculum was developed by psychologists who specialize in leadership development, and is based on cutting-edge child developmental, leadership, and educational research. This project aims to research the engagement and effectiveness of the program and its ability to enhance ten core leadership behaviors in youth, at home, in the community, and in academic settings. This program has the potential to make a long-term impact on the next generation of youth, promoting resilience in the face of adverse events, such as school violence and cyberbullying, and to positively shape the next generation of leaders, helping them form lifelong commitments to personal and professional development. The project has philanthropic aspirations to make the educational curriculum available to all children and schools, regardless of socio-economic standing, supporting the mission of NSF to promote the health, prosperity and welfare of the nation through science.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is focused on the development of an interactive leadership program for children, that is proven to make a positive impact on leadership behaviors and that is also fun and engaging for youth and their adult caregivers and educators. What sets this program apart from others is that the research will provide evidence that the program builds the critical skills it intends on developing in children. The program is designed to be self-led or facilitated by an adult caregiver or educator, either using an online platform or physical materials.  As children move from one leadership competency to another, they are extrinsically and intrinsically rewarded for their efforts. Adult caregivers and educators are encouraged to participate and are provided mastery building exercises that help them take the child?s leadership understanding and skill to the next level. A database has been developed to track real-time participant feedback as curriculum elements are developed. The testing of educational content will focus on three aspects, which include maximizing content appropriateness, validating learning and skill retention, and assessing variances and preferences for mode of delivery. Results will be used to make modifications to the curriculum and product design for commercialization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
