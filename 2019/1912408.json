 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers at North Carolina Central University propose to examine the impact of incorporating social justice projects in data science courses to improve students? understanding of data science and increase STEM persistence among underrepresented minority students.  The assumption is that STEM can serve as a vehicle for addressing social inequities, a topic of interest to the targeted population. The project aims also to produce a pool of fifteen well-vetted and rigorously developed data science projects that infuse social justice issues aligned with the interests of underrepresented students. The project will document the process of integrating the projects into the curriculum and will make accessible through a website the materials, facilitator guides, and accompanying resources to enable replication and scalability of the research outcomes.  \r\n\r\nThe researchers will use a mixed-methods design-based approach to build the evidence base for the pedagogical innovation and examine the efficacy of the implementation process. The broad framework of Contextual Teaching and Learning  and problem-based Learning frameworks will guide the following research questions: (1) To what extent does the application of data science projects grounded in social justice influence enrollment and retention outcomes at an HBCU and its affiliated Early College High School? (2) How does the application of data science projects grounded in social justice impact the socio-cognitive factors known to mediate and moderate STEM enrollment, persistence, and success? and (3) What are the key features of this pathway model that will guide replication efforts by other STEM programs at institutions?  The content of data science grounded in social justice projects will be delivered through an existing project-based course that is required for all students. The Successive Approximation Model or iterative design-develop-test process will guide the collection and analysis of data to assess the degree to which the project materials are usable, of high quality, and endorsed.  The project is expected to provide empirical evidence of an effective model to address underrepresentation in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
