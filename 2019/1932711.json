 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will bring together leading academic, industry, and government representatives with the goal of identifying the research challenges and opportunities for the next generation of networked transportation systems. Examples of networked transportation systems include shared mobility services, electric vehicles and their integration with the power grid, near-real-time e-commerce delivery, and autonomous vehicles.  Networked transportation systems may make transportation more sustainable, more resilient to disruption, more equitable, and more efficient, but this will only occur with the right fundamental insights to aid their design, deployment, and management.   This workshop will identify the research challenges that need to be addressed before truly smart transportation systems can emerge and enable practical benefits to society at large. \r\n\r\nThe rapid technological innovation occurring in nearly all modes of mobility is uniquely defining the present time as a period of dynamism in transportation systems. As networked transportation systems grow in complexity, the need for convergence between the decision sciences and the transportation science communities becomes paramount. The purpose of this workshop is the creation of a forum where the networked controls community and the transportation science community can begin to exchange ideas and perspectives on recent advances in the field as well as the core challenges inhibiting research progress on current and future networked transportation systems. The workshop will consist of a series of talks and panel discussions from leading academics in each domain, as well as short perspectives from participants representing industry and government.  The themes include i) how to control transportation systems in an age where components are connected and increasingly autonomous; ii) understanding the role of data driven models and decision tools in transportation systems that need to be safe, resilient, and equitable; and iii) recognizing the significant role of humans in the networked transportation system. The talks and discussions will be used as the basis of a final report that will be published and shared with the research communities involved in networked transportation systems research. \r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
