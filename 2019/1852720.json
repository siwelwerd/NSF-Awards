 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium, sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is a top-tier venue for quick and wide dissemination of cutting-edge research results in cyber-security and privacy and has been for much of its 40-year history. Participation in this symposium gives students the opportunity to showcase their research and network with established researchers in the cyber security area. Such participation is an important part of graduate education in cyber security. The 2019 IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium will consist of approximately 60 technical papers including several Systematization of Knowledge papers, which provide a valuable background to students who are starting out in specific research areas. \r\n\r\nThis award provides travel support to encourage participation in the 2019 IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium and its Student Program Committee meeting by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
