 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. This research investigates how males and females display outwardly similar behaviors when the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are predicted to be different. The project examines the hormonal and genomic basis of territorial aggression a behavior that is widespread across the animal kingdom and critical for reproductive success. Studies of male animals reveal that hormones like testosterone, as well as genes expressed in the brain, regulate aggression. However, aggression is also important for females of many species, especially in birds that compete for limited nesting space. An open question is whether male and female aggression are controlled by similar or different mechanisms. This research will survey multiple bird families to examine differences in aggression between males and females, as well as hormones, gene expression, and genome evolution. \r\n\r\nThe independent origin of similar phenotypes across distantly-related groups is compelling evidence for natural selection, but the proximate bases of behavioral convergence are poorly understood. This research evaluates the mechanistic convergence underlying a repeatedly evolved behavior: cavity-nesting. Both male and female cavity-nesters compete for nest sites, providing an opportunity to assess the nature and degree of mechanistic parallelism between males and females. This work will broadly sample genomes across a phylogeny to quantify positive selection associated with the evolution of cavity nesting. A comparison of hormonal and neural gene expression for multiple species pairs with and without cavity nesting will assess whether convergent selection on the cavity-nesting phenotype predicts male/female differences in aggression across families. This work tests an emergent hypothesis that gene sequence variation, neural gene expression, and hormone levels act independently to bring about convergent behavioral phenotypes. The project's broader impacts are designed to engage and retain students from underrepresented groups as they transition from high school to college. The fellow will pair with high school teachers near Indiana University to design learning modules on the reproductive stages of cavity-nesting, and engage students in hands-on research with interactive 'eBirdhouses' to collect environmental and behavioral data from wild birds. This project provides training for students in critical thinking, data analysis, and public speaking skills essential to success in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For many species, reproduction involves competition over vital resources like mates and/or territories. When resources are limited, aggressive individuals may be more successful, suggesting that mechanisms increasing aggression could be favored in competitive environments. Our primary understanding of aggression, including its underlying genetic and hormonal mechanisms, comes from research on male animals. Female-female competition is widespread among animals, but relative to male-male competition, we know much less about its causes and consequences. As an NSF postdoctoral research fellow, I asked: when female animals fight, are their competitive traits and behaviors generated by similar processes in males?</p>\n<p>To answer this question, I studied species for which female competition is important for reproductive success. Birds have a wide variety of nesting strategies to facilitate reproduction, and I focused on obligate secondary cavity nesting, which involves rearing offspring inside a hole in a tree. Unlike a woodpecker, secondary cavity nesters can't make their own hole, and cavities are a limited resource. I hypothesized that the limited abundance of nesting cavities generates strong competition among females, who require a cavity to reproduce. To test this hypothesis, I evaluated competitive behaviors, testosterone, and neural transcriptomic profiles in females and males from 5 avian families, each with a species pair that included a cavity-nester and close relative with a more flexible nesting strategy. This research used innovative genomic and neuroendocrine tools to discover the underpinnings of complex behavioral traits in free-living, non-model organisms, which is vital for understanding evolution in the wild.</p>\n<p>As predicted, I found that aggression was higher in cavity-nesting females than in species with more flexible nesting strategies. Group-level differences in testosterone did not explain these behavioral differences, but individual differences in testosterone predicted variation in aggression within a species. This suggests that the evolutionary processes shaping behavior and testosterone within a species do not necessarily scale to the evolutoinary processes acting across species. I nevertheless identified a conserved genomic signature of cavity nesting, with neural gene expression profiles in females and males enriched for energy metabolic processes. These results suggest that the evolution of aggression may involve similar pathways across multiple avian families. My&nbsp;focus on competition over essential breeding resources, a context relevant to both sexes, provides a useful framework for co-consideration of female and male animals. Broadly, this research contributes to societal advancement by including female animals in the study of important biological questions.</p>\n<p>Beyond my primary research project, I have conducted several other related studies. I investigated genetic and hormonal correlates of female competition in socially polyandrous species, for which females compete for mates, and males conduct all parental care. I also contributed to research studying how neural and gonadal gene expression changes in response to extreme heat, to model how climate change is impacting animal communication and reproduction. During the course of my postdoc, I have shared my research with the broader scientific community by presenting at over 25 departmental seminars and conference talks and publishing 11 manuscripts, with several more in preparation. Thanks to this postdoctoral fellowship, I have learned many valuable techniques in field ornithology, neuroendocrinology, and behavioral genomics. The training and independence afforded by this fellowship helped me secure a tenure-track position as an Assistant Professor of Genomics at Loyola University in Chicago, where I will continue pursuing research and educating future generations of scientists, doctors, teachers, and scientifically literate members of society for decades to come.</p>\n<p>In addition to my research efforts, I have worked to broaden the participation of groups underrepresented in STEM. At the high school level, I collaborated with the Jim Holland Program at Indiana University, an initiative designed to address ethnic and racial disparities in STEM fields. The program engages students from underrepresented groups in scientific and professional development workshops, to prepare for STEM majors in college. I ran workshops on Evolution, Bird Identification and Behavior, and provided binoculars and field guides for students to observe wildlife during the COVID-19 shutdown. Additional K-12 outreach included Indiana University ScienceFest, STEAM Night, and several Skype a Scientist classroom visits about bird behavior, hormones, and genetics, and what its like being a scientist. In service to my academic communities, I have trained and mentored over 25 undergraduates, postbacs, and graduate students in various field and laboratory techniques, both in research-directed projects and workshops. Five former mentees are currently in, or about to join, STEM graduate programs, and one is applying to medical school. I also facilitated a reading group for PhD students and postdocs, which developed and implemented plans to make fieldwork safer and more inclusive for trainees. Lastly, I organized an alternative academic science career panel through the Postdoctoral Association of Indiana University Bloomington, as well as a department-wide workshop from ADVANCEGeo to support diversity, equity and inclusion in field research.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/27/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sara&nbsp;E&nbsp;Lipshutz</p>\n</div>\n<div
