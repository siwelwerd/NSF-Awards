 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is funding to support a Pioneers Workshop (doctoral consortium) of approximately 21 students (18 graduate participants, one undergraduate participant, and two student organizers), along with distinguished research faculty. This full-day event will take place as part of the first day of activities at the 14th International Conference on Human Robot Interaction (HRI 2019), to be held March 11-14 in Daegu, South Korea, and which is jointly sponsored by ACM and IEEE. HRI is the premier conference for showcasing the very best interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research on human-robot interaction, with roots in diverse fields including robotics, artificial intelligence, social psychology, cognitive science, human-computer interaction, human factors, engineering, and many more. It is a single-track, highly selective annual international conference that invites broad participation. The theme of HRI 2019 is \"Collaborative HRI.\" The conference seeks contributions from a broad set of perspectives, including technical, design, methodological, behavioral, and theoretical, that advance fundamental and applied knowledge and methods in human-robot interaction, with the goal of enabling human-robot interaction through new technical advances, novel robot designs, new guidelines for design, and advanced methods for understanding and evaluating interaction. More information about the conference is available online at http://humanrobotinteraction.org/2019.\r\n\r\nThe Pioneers Workshop is designed to complement the conference by affording a unique opportunity for the best of the next generation of researchers in human-robot interaction to be exposed to and discuss current and relevant topics as they are being studied in several different research communities.  Participants are encouraged to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development, to form collaborative relationships, and to generate new research questions to be addressed during the coming years.  Participants also gain leadership and service experience, as the workshop is largely student organized and student led. The workshop provides a forum for students and recent graduates in the field of HRI to share their current research with their peers and a panel of senior researchers in a setting that is less formal and more interactive than the main conference. During the workshop, participants talk about the important upcoming research themes in the field. The formation of collaborative relationships across disciplines and geographic boundaries is encouraged. To these ends, the workshop format encompasses a variety of activities including keynotes, a distinguished panel session, and breakout sessions. To start the day, all workshop attendees briefly introduce themselves and their interests. Following the opening keynote, approximately half of the participants present 3-minute overviews of their work, leading into an interactive poster session. This enables all participants to share their research and receive feedback from students and senior researchers in an informal setting.  After lunch, the remaining workshop participants give their 3-minute overviews, followed by presentation of their posters during a second interactive poster session. Senior researchers (in addition to those on the panel) are invited to attend the student presentations and poster sessions in order to provide feedback to participants, and workshop participants are invited to present their posters during the main poster session of the HRI conference as well.  The day will end with a working dinner for general discussion, reflection and career advice, which will facilitate networking.  The organizers have a strong commitment to recruiting women and members from under-represented groups, and to attracting students and postdocs from different areas of the world and from diverse areas of research.  To further ensure diversity, no more than two student participants will be accepted from a particular institution, and if two are accepted then at  least one of the participants must be female.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
