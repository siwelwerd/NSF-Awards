 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award provides travel funds enabling students to attend the 15th IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC) to be held in Orlando, FL on November 3-5, 2019.  IISWC is the premier forum for understanding and characterization of workloads that run on all types of computing systems. Topics of interest include but are not limited to characterization of applications in domains; emerging workloads and architectures; implications of workloads in design issues; benchmark creation and evaluation; characterization of OS/VMM, middleware and library behavior; measurement tools and techniques.\r\n\r\nThe award is to provide travel support for around 30 U.S.-based students attending this event. The selection process will give priority to US citizens and permanent residents, with special consideration to members of under-represented groups and participants from universities that do not have a strong tradition in the topical areas covered in the conference, in order to expand the scope of the conference participation. Students attending this workshop will benefit from the rich interactions and networking/mentoring opportunities afforded by their presence at the event.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
