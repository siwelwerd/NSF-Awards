 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human use of natural resources is a critical component for understanding human prehistory. The goal of this project is to test a new approach that could shed light on the availability of natural resources and whether or how early humans in Alaska harvested resources thus understanding past human behavior and development. In central Alaska, the climate was changing rapidly as the world transitioned from glacial to modern climate conditions between 20,000 and 5,000 years before present. This triggered the spread of the forest, expansion, extinction, and/or redistribution of game animals (such as elk, bison, and moose), and the establishment of salmon streams. Various well-established methods, such as bone and plant identification, shed light on this past resource use, however, challenges in the identification or preservation of these samples can yield an incomplete picture of human activity. Ancient DNA extracted from archaeological sediments can address these challenges, but the preservation of the ancient DNA in sediments that are unfrozen for part of the year - sediments that are typical of many Arctic contexts - is currently untested. This project will assess new and transformational methodologies on ancient DNA that can add a new view on the relationship between humans and their environment thousands of years ago. \r\n\r\nIn this study, ancient DNA results will be rigorously analyzed to assess preservation and sampling issues that may result from sediments that are unfrozen for four months of the year - a methodological challenge that has yet to be tested. The project team will compare ancient DNA results from archaeological sediments that are unfrozen about four months of the year, which are typical of central Alaska, with a sediment type that has been shown to preserve ancient DNA (lake sediments) to assess the reliability of ancient DNA results from these new contexts. This project has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of past landscapes and human use of those landscapes by applying this new approach for archaeologists working in Alaska and other parts of the Arctic.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of this project were to:\n\nAssess the preservation and reliability of sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) preserved in archaeological sediments dating to ~14,000-8000 years ago.   \nUse sedaDNA preserved in a lake sediment core to document recent and ancient changes (decades to several millennia) in fish taxa present in the lake.  The recent changes were compared with the known history of fish stocking and fish extirpation in the lake.\nUse fecal biomarkers on recent lake sediment samples as well as lake shoreline samples to assess whether the method has the sensitivity to document human presence around the lake.\n\n\nAs summarized below, these analyses expanded our toolkit for reconstructing past landscapes and the human use of it.  However, these techniques also have caveats, which must be taken into account when interpreting the results.\n\nKey Findings\n\nArchaeological sedaDNA provided useful results and indicates that ancient DNA (aDNA) is preserved, even in sediments that are unfrozen for four months of the year.  Plant taxa recovered in the archaeological sediments were generally similar to those preserved in a nearby lake core, with a major difference:  the increased abundance of aDNA from edible fruits and berries.  This is consistent with the samples coming from an archaeological site where people were collecting fruits and berries, although this could also be driven by differences in vegetation surrounding the sites.  However, damage analyses also indicate that at least some of the plant aDNA, especially those taxa represented by the most abundant DNA such as willow and horsetail, was modern and could be due to root penetration.  An exception to this is sedge, which showed signals of authentic ancient DNA.  Mammalian aDNA was more difficult to analyze, but the taxa that were recovered (i.e. bison, burbot, mink, and American red squirrel) are consistent with our understanding of the fauna in the region.\n\nMetabarcoding and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses of lake core-derived DNA provided insights on the relative performance of these two approaches for tracking the history of fish distributions in interior Alaska.
