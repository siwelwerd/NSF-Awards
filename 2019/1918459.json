 "awd_abstract_narration": "The shape of landscapes partly depends on the physical properties of the bedrock that underlies them (e.g., how strong different rock types are in different places, how fractured the rocks are, and how easily particular rocks break down to make soil and sediment, also known as weathering). It should be possible to \"read\" rock properties from landscape form (topography), but we currently lack a quantitative relationship that can be used practically. For example, the likelihood of landslides depends on rock and soil properties. Past tectonic activity and the potential for future earthquakes along faults can also potentially be inferred from topography, but the effects of tectonics must be isolated from rock property controls on landscape form. Predicting land surface properties would also be beneficial for planning access to remote areas following natural disasters or during human conflicts. The researchers will develop teaching modules based on the Guadalupe Mountains to use in a dual enrollment (i.e., college credit for high school students) geoscience course taught through UT Austin that provides college credit to high school students across Texas.  High school geoscience and environmental science teachers will be trained through intensive and fun field workshops to be taught in the Guadalupe Mountains.\r\n\r\nThis project uses the Guadalupe Mountains in Texas and New Mexico as a natural laboratory to understand how rock properties can be inferred from topography. In addition to (a) using geographic information system analysis to relate meter-scale topographic data and digital geology maps, the researchers will also (b) make extensive field measurements of rock properties across this landscape, (c) determine long-term bedrock erosion rates by measuring cosmogenic radionuclide concentrations from rock samples, and (d) evaluate open-source computer models that predict how landscapes will evolve through time, and improve these models to better incorporate rock properties into their equations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The Guadalupe Mountains are known to many Americans because they are the home of Carlsbad Caverns National Park. The caves form because of the presence of carbonate rocks, also known as limestone. Rainwater seeping underground can dissolve the carbonate rocks, creating caves. The carbonate rocks are pervasive throughout the landscape and are layered horizontally between layers of sandstone (Figure 1). The thickness of the different layers varies greatly in space. In some locations the alternating layers are only a few feet thick (Figure 2). Our project explored the impact of the high spatial variability in rock properties on the processes shaping the landscape and the shape of the landscape.</p>\n<p><br />To quantify the strength and properties of the rock in the river channels, we measured how broken-up (fractured) the bedrock is and the intact compressive strength of the rock. We can observe the riverbeds because they are mostly dry except during summer flash floods. We use a hammer designed to test the strength of concrete to measure the intact strength of the rock. We use high resolution imagery (from videos taken on the ground and with a drone) to measure the fracture density of the bedrock. The data are messy, but in general more fractured rocks have weaker intact strength, as one might expect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />The river channels are shallow (not steep) upstream and become very steep downstream (Figure 3). Intuitively one might think that the steep parts of the river are eroding faster than the shallow parts. However, we hypothesize that the steep part of the river is not eroding in the current climate, because the steep part is mostly covered in large boulders. From drone imagery and on-the-ground measurements, we know the distribution of boulder sizes (and smaller sediment) and the amount of sediment cover in the channel. In all cases the mean boulder volume increases from the shallow to the steep part of the channels, in some cases by over a factor of 10. In four of our five study channels, the proportion of channel bed covered with sediment and boulders increases from the shallow (upstream) to steep (downstream) parts of the channels.</p>\n<p><br />Where bedrock is exposed in the channel, it is two times more likely to be carbonate than sandstone. In regions where sandstone is exposed in the channel, it is not very broken-up, but we see highly fractured sandstone on the hillslopes (Figure 2). In contrast, the carbonate rocks are less fractured everywhere. Because most of the riverbed is covered in boulders, we hypothesize that where the bed is made of fractured sandstone, it is weaker, has eroded to be flatter, and thus is covered in boulders and less exposed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Although there are large flash floods and the climate is extreme (Figure 4), the floods are not big enough to move the large boulders. To illustrate this, we built a computer model that uses current climate data to model flash floods in our river channels. We developed a computer code to calculate what sediment sizes can move during the flash floods. Our modeling suggests that with a predicted 1,000-year storm, or a storm that has a 1 in 1,000 chance of happening any year, the large boulders do not move. That means the boulders essentially act as bedrock, and despite the steepness of the river channel and large floods, the channel is stable in the current climate.</p>\n<p><br />We also studied the hillslopes surrounding the channels to understand the connection between intact rock properties on the hillslopes, which are less covered in sediment than the channels, and the size of the sediment in the channels. Most sediment in the channels is supplied from the surrounding hillslopes. We observe that where there are thicker, less fractured carbonate rocks on the hillslopes and the river channel is more deeply incised into the landscape, the hillslopes are generally steeper and the sediment in the river below is larger (Figure 3). We measured the type and size of largest boulder in 40 ft (vertical) intervals in the channel (Figure 5). The largest boulder is twice as likely to be carbonate than sandstone rock. This suggests that boulders are breaking off from the hillsides, primarily from the carbonate rocks, falling into the channel, and not being transported.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />This project partially supported the PhD degree of one graduate student and research projects for six undergraduate students at Tulane University. The students gained expertise in field protocols, measurements, and observations, using drones and interpreting drone data, software development, and modeling. The students who have graduated have followed diverse career paths, including hydrologist on wildland fire fighting teams and Navy flight school.
