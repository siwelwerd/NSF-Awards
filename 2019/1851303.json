 "awd_abstract_narration": "The global expansion of investment in international tourism, including by governments in the developing world, has meant that increasing numbers of workers are employed in this sector of the economy. Interestingly, at a time when worker organizations generally are on the decline, this sector has seen an increase. However, preliminary research suggests these new organizations are unlike those of the past. They appear to be focused on broad array of social programs for their membership while simultaneously loosening, or even severing, their ties to formal political parties. The research supported by this award will undertake an ethnographic and archival analysis of this new phenomenon. Findings from this research are important for rethinking the relationship between worker wellbeing and formal worker organizations. Findings will contribute to new theoretical understandings of the contemporary global economy and provide information useful for policy makers and other stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis research will take place on the coast of Mexico, a tourism dependent region that has witnessed tremendous growth in worker organizations over the past two decades. The researcher will conduct a comparative institutional and archival analysis of two organizations, tracing political, economic, and social factors that produce their structures; relationships between the organizations and other social actors in the region; and their historical development. Data will be collected with a mix of ethnographic methods including participant observation in organizational headquarters and organization sponsored social programs; interviews with workers and leadership; discourse analysis; archival research; and focus groups. Findings from this research will provide insight into the social factors that promote and sustain worker organizations, the social and political effects this has on regions that rely on international tourism, and the significance of such organizations for workers lives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

My time was equally spent between two unions representing worker in the tourism sector, and over the course of my time in the field, I conducted at least 75 formal interviews with workers, union leaders, business leaders, and local politicians. In addition to formal interviews, I conducted hundreds of informal interviews, spent time with workers in their homes, and socialiazed with them in the community. I observed and participated in worker trainings, leadership courses held by each union, and other capacity building workshops. From this extensive ethnographic research, I will mention three important findings.</p>\n<p>First, this project reveals the crucial role played by organized labor in the development of the tourism sector in Quintana Roo and identifies the historical, political-economic, and sociocultural factors that have contributed to this relationship. This finding suggests that typical accounts of tourism development in Quintana Roo that stress the top-down role played by the federal state and international actors does not offer a comprehensive account of how the tourism developed since Quintana Roo&rsquo;s granting of statehood in 1974. This project makes space for organized labor to be part of that narrative too, yet it also recommends further historical research to be conducted in this region to identify the local state actors and other civil society actors who also contributed to the region&rsquo;s development.</p>\n<p>Second, this project uncovers the role crime plays in the tourism sector and the way criminal relations have become an important feature of formal labor relations among unionized workers. Specifically, it illuminates the direct and indirect relationships between organized crime, organized labor, and local businesses in the maintenance and reproduction of the region&rsquo;s vice economy and the robust trade in narcotics. Despite the ubiquity of drugs and the failure of the Mexican state to seriously ban their production, sale, and use through a militarized criminal enforcement strategy over the last 15 years, such policies persist despite their lack of success. There are several implications from this finding. First, the drug trade has been generative of economic growth in Quintana Roo and is partly responsible for the state&rsquo;s economic success and the upward mobility some workers in the state have experienced. Second, participants in this study identified the prohibition of drugs, rather than the drug trade, as the reason for any instance of insecurity in the region. This finding add further evidence to calls that the drug war in Mexico (and beyond) must draw to a close and that a prohibition policy must be abandoned. Third, it suggests that entanglement between the licit and illicit economies means that prohibition policies might be to the benefit of criminal organizations.</p>\n<p>Third, this project finds that unions have played an active role in improving the economic position of their membership, but not without generating new forms of inequality across class and gender lines. One of the reasons for this outcome, this project suggests, is that Mexico&rsquo;s integration into the global economy and its adoption of liberalizing economic reforms over the past 30 years has severely weakened and transformed organized labor. These transformations have made it harder for unions to assume an adversarial role against employers and have instead incentivized unions to focus on membership capacity building and skill development as alternatives to labor struggle. At the same time, this project finds that hotel worker unions cooperate more extensively with employers and focus more on retaining jobs for their members rather than improving workplace conditions. This finding suggests that recent labor law reform policies passed by the federal state are unlikely to improve the condition of workers in the tourism sector since they do not address the weakened bargaining position of labor. This finding likely has broader applicability and foreshadows further declines of union density in the manufacturing sector. To better improve the position of workers and labor organizations, this project recommends Mexico adopt a sectoral bargaining labor policy and that sectoral bargaining agreements across the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement countries be pursued, particular with respect to tourism.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/01/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Brandon&nbsp;M&nbsp;Hunter</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
