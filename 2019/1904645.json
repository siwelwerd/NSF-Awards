 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, and co-funding from the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, Professor Shaorong Liu at the University of Oklahoma is working to improve the effectiveness of methods targeting analysis of chemical species associated with individual cells. By devising enhanced sampling techniques and coupling them with improved separation and high-sensitivity detection, the Liu group seeks to enable observation of responses of individual cells to various stimuli, thereby complementing the ensemble average usually measured by conventional methods.  Technical impact is enhanced through collaborations with instrument manufacturers, improving prospects for commercialization of the approach.  Educational impacts are enhanced through outreach efforts engaging regional teachers and participation in an international undergraduate summer research experience program.\r\n\r\nThe research group in Professor Liu's lab explores the efficiency limits of narrow open tubular liquid chromatography to identify and ameliorate the factors governing these limits. To exploit the advantages of narrow open tubular columns, the group fabricates very small sample injectors and electrospray emitters, enabling the coupling of narrow open tubular liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry for single mammalian cell in-situ analysis. The research seeks to advance knowledge and extend the boundaries of separation science.  This in turn will enable studies of cell heterogeneity, providing better understanding how cells develop and how diseases evolve.  Collaboration with an instrument manufacturer facilitates the commercialization of this technology.  Introducing these topics to rural high school science and mathematics teachers seeks to leverage efforts to improve STEM education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
