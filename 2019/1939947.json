 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Systems Research (CSR) and the Networking Technology and Systems (NeTS) programs support a wide range of computer systems and network research, from small low-power embedded systems to large high-performance systems, from basic connectivity technologies to enable faster networking on both wired and wireless systems, from performance to availability, and from reliability to security. Nowadays, systems and networking research areas are often highly intertwined.  The purpose of the CSR and NeTS combined principal investigators meeting is to bring together researchers from both communities to exchange ideas and provide a platform for cross-fertilization of ideas.\r\n\r\nThe meeting is organized as a collection of keynote speeches, panel discussions, posters, and breakout sessions. Keynote presentations and panel discussions will offer visions for future research. Breakout sessions will focus on different subfields to identify challenges and solutions. Poster sessions will enable face-to-face discussion and promote interactions of researchers from the two communities. \r\n\r\nBy identifying major research challenges in systems and networking areas over the next decade, and their synergies, the meeting has the potential to have transformative impact on both the CSR and NeTS research communities. The organizers of the meeting plan to produce documents detailing the discussions on the research topics. The project will also provide a forum, both for learning and for disseminating ideas, for early career (aspiring) principal investigators, and those from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
