 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proton beam accelerators find wide applications in technology and research. The most famous machine is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN on the Franco-Swiss border in Europe with a circumference of 16.6 miles. Reducing the size of these machines is a major goal in accelerator physics. A promising avenue utilizes intense laser beams as a compact proton source. The laser-driven proton beams to be generated in this project are expected to achieve relativistic speeds with favorable properties to reduce the size and cost of future accelerator facilities. For this purpose, a new Stanford jet target technology will be combined with a high-power laser at the Tel-Aviv Intense Lasers and Ultrafast Science facility in Israel, which has one of the fastest repetition rates in the world, firing 10 times per second. At these high rates the group will use machine learning algorithms for proton beam optimization to enable applications with high pay-off for society.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will perform high-repetition rate laser experiments that allow the application of machine learning algorithms to manipulate the laser pulse shape and contrast to optimize the proton beam properties. The goal is to achieve beams suitable for injection into a radio-frequency powered accelerator that has the capability to reach beam energies of 230 MeV + on a meter scale. This research will have far-reaching impact beyond the fields of laser-plasma and accelerator physics. The demonstration of the control of streaming instabilities and delivering protons beams of energy >20 MeV, >1 nC charge, <0.03 mm mrad emittance and repetition rates of 10 Hz as proposed here are well suited for subsequent acceleration to high proton energies for applications in research, medicine, and manufacturing. Stanford, with expertise in lasers, high-repetition rate experiments and accelerators, is in a unique position to deliver the components needed for compact high-efficiency hybrid accelerators.  This work will involve collaboration between Stanford University, the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, and Tel-Aviv University in Israel, and will be performed under the umbrella of the Memorandum of Understanding on Research Cooperation between NSF and the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The unprecedented high acceleration gradients in laser-proton experiments hold great promise for the development of these beams to replace very large and costly accelerators and make ion beams broadly available beyond fundamental research institutions and use them for real-world applications. Examples of potential future applications include material processing, high field and dense matter imaging, transmutations of nuclear waste, or medical tumor therapies. The goal of this NSF-BSF-supported project is to explore and demonstrate new acceleration regimes that simultaneously achieve all the requirements on ion beam energy, charge, emittance, and repetition rate. We succeeded in demonstrating a new physics regime that is characterized by the recirculation of energetic electrons using sub-micron thin targets and a laser with excellent intensity contrast. The advantage of this process lies in the fact that it results in ion beams that are well collimated in the forward direction and thus very well suited for applications. In addition, we have observed that the energy of the protons scales with laser intensity as predicted by theory allowing us to make detailed predictions for future developments of ion beams. Such studies will investigate the exploration of regimes that include targets with reduced mass and atomic number combined with the use of higher laser intensities.</span></h1>\n<h1><span>To eventually replace traditional proton beam accelerators that are costly and scarce due to their large footprint and substantial operational overhead we will pursue the design of a compact hybrid accelerator. This project will investigate the injection of high-energy laser-produced proton beams into a high-gradient radio-frequency accelerator. This new concept promises a compact, meter-scale accelerator with the potential to revolutionize the fields of proton and ion beam physics. End-to-end simulations conducted at Stanford have resolved the laser-plasma interactions, ion beam transport, and acceleration through the radiofrequency accelerating cavities, including the effects of space charge. First simulation results have indicated efficient high-energy injection and delivery of a mono-energetic ion beam at 250 MeV with 0.3 nC charge in a picosecond pulse. Such short pulses are un-matched by traditional ion beam accelerators and promise 10 TW ion beam pulses. The NSF-BSF-supported collaboration between Stanford and Tel Aviv University has contributed to the development of such compact hybrid accelerators based on laser-proton injection. Developing the physics understanding for delivery of highly controlled proton beams at high repetition rates as pursued here is critically important to successfully deploy these devices in the future.</span></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/20/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Siegfried&nbsp;Glenzer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903414/1903414_10605630_1674254010886_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903414/1903414_10605630_1674254010886_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Laser intensity-target thickness phase space\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1903414/1903414_10605630_1674254010886_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Laser intensity-target thickness phase space\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Phase space of laser intensity vs target thickness showing achievable liquid jet thicknesses indicating that they are suitable for ion beam acceleration at high repetition rates.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ambient-temperature liquid jet targets for high-repetition-rate HED discovery science, F.
