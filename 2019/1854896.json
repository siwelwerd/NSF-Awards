 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal flooding is one of the most dangerous and damaging natural hazards that societies face, and coastal development and climate change are causing a dramatic rise in vulnerability.  Since the 19th century, estuary channels have typically been deepened and widened by a factor of two or three, harbor entrances have been deepened and streamlined, and a large proportion of wetlands have been filled over and replaced with neighborhoods.  Such geomorphic changes increase flood risk by reducing natural resistance to storm surge and tides.  Similarly, sea level rise and climate-modulated variations in storm characteristics such as intensity, size and track path also alter flood risk.  The overarching goal of the proposed research project is to reveal and contrast the mechanisms by which these geomorphic and climatic changes alter flood risk.  This goal will be met using a combination of computational modeling, historical climate and storm surge data analysis, and theory-based synthesis.  The study will provide support for a postdoctoral research associate and several graduate students and undergraduates, including underrepresented groups.  It will improve the well-being of communities within urbanized harbors and estuaries by highlighting coastal development practices that can worsen coastal flooding.  The project plan increases scientific literacy and engagement, and connects the research to applications through interactions with local stakeholders and governments, as well as the US Geological Survey and the US Army Corps of Engineers.\r\n\r\nThe project will improve the understanding and separation of climatic and geomorphic factors in coastal flooding through several elements of novel research and technical innovation.  The investigators will use a unique tide-gauge data set that extends back to the 19th century together with contemporary, retrospective, and idealized hydrodynamic models to elucidate system sensitivities.  Well-known, simplified insights into tidal dynamics will be tested for storm surge, then used to help interpret how altered local topography, bathymetry and wetland area have changed frictional damping and long-wave mechanics.  A combined analysis of climate, storm characteristics, and morphologic change will identify the modes and pathways through which climate variability and bathymetric change modulate storms surges.  Advanced non-stationary univariate and multivariate statistical models will be developed and employed to incorporate these changes and assess how statistical properties relevant for coastal design and risk assessments respond.  A flood model inter-comparison workshop will help quantify relevant modeling sensitivities, which will help to improve estuary and floodplain predictions for the academic and operational forecasting community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The increased flood hazard caused by sea level rise and U.S. coastal population growth are well known. Less studied, however, is how flooding in estuaries is changing due to geomorphic changes such as dredging and both natural and climatic variability. The characteristics of storm surge and coastal flooding depend on both far-field forcing (meteorological, oceanographic) and on local characteristics (estuary bathymetry, floodplain land cover). As a result, changes to any of these factors may greatly influence flood hazard. In many locations, the local changes are huge: since the 19th century, estuary channels have typically been deepened and widened by a factor of two or three, harbor entrances have been deepened and streamlined, and a large proportion of wetlands have been lost to landfill development. Our research shows that such geomorphic changes, which can be referred to as estuary urbanization, increase flood risk by reducing natural resistance to storm surge and tides. Similarly, sea level rise, natural (astronomically-forced) variations in tides, and variable storm characteristics such as storm track, speed, or size also alter flood risk.\n\n\nOur results are helping to show that estuary urbanization can have a major impact on flood hazards, worsening both storm surge and high-tide flooding. Increases in tidal amplitudes are exacerbating nuisance (\"high tide\") flooding at nearly half of the long-term measurement sites evaluated (18 of 40 NOAA gauges). The number of nuisance floods was 27% higher in 2019 at those 18 locations than it would have been without tidal amplitude increases. Our evidence and computer modeling show that any hurricane storm surge affecting parts of New York City, Jacksonville, Wilmington, Philadelphia and South Florida, among other locations, will likely produce higher water levels due to estuary urbanization, potentially causing more damage in unprotected regions.\n\n\nOur research is also helping to reveal and contrast the mechanisms by which climate and weather variability and geomorphic changes alter flood risk. Increases in storm surge (for the same meteorological forcing) are often strongest in urbanized estuaries that previously had natural features that reduced surges (e.g., the Saint Johns Estuary). Idealized modeling of storm surge shows that the amount of change due to channel deepening also depends on tide-surge non-linear frictional effects, the time scale of the surge (fast or slow), the frequency of the major tide forcing, and the magnitude or river flow. Large increases in tides and storm surge water levels are also often observed at estuary boundaries, both due to long-wave reflection effects but also sometimes resonance. Finally, our research shows that natural variations in tides, for example over the 18.6 year nodal cycle and the 8.85 year cycle of lunar perigee, influence the risk of major floods in about 70% of the 551 gauges evaluated. In Boston, the area of the 100 year floodplain varies by about 45% over a 18.6 year cycle (under current sea-level conditions).\n\n\nWe also developed methods for attribution of flooding to climate change and geomorphic change. The roles of geomorphic change and climate change on flooding were contrasted for New York Citys heavily urbanized Jamaica Bay, revealing that geomorphic change has had a similar influence as climate change driven sea level rise. For most coastal sites, however, sea level rise has a larger impact than geomorphic change. Hurricane Sandys flooding resulted in $8.1 billion more damage and 70,000 more people affected due to climate change induced sea level rise.\n\n\nThis project also provides a new understanding of how weather variability can determine flood characteristics. For example, research showed that the interaction of storms and blocking anticyclones can lead to persistent storm surge events for the Northeastern US. For tropical cyclone events along the East Coast occurring over the last half century, the project provided a sensitivity analysis relating storm surge events to storm characteristics such as storm strength, forward speed and approach angle. It also provided benchmarks on storm surge probabilities. Work examining the spatial footprints of storms showed regions in which flood risk is coherent. In the future, all these efforts can help improve models, and provide avenues for using less spatially and temporally complete historical data to improve understanding of past climate change.\n\n\nThe project leveraged interactions with several governmental entities to broaden the reach of our findings  The New York City Office of Restoration and Resilience (via the NYC Panel on Climate Change), the US Geological Survey and the US Army Corps of Engineers. It also provided significant support for three early career principal investigators, 5 postdoctoral research associates, 5 PhD students, 6 MS students, and 3 undergraduates and 2 high school students, with several of these coming from groups that are underrepresented in academic science.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/23/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ThomasWahl\n"
