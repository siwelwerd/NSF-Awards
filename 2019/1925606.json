 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is funding to support a Doctoral Consortium (workshop) of approximately 10 promising graduate students from U.S. institutions of higher learning, along with at least 3 distinguished research faculty as mentors, to be held in conjunction with the Twelfth International Conference on Pervasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments (PETRA 2019), which will take place June 5-7 on the island of Rhodes, Greece.  The PETRA mission is to promote interdisciplinary research on ways to use pervasive ambient intelligent environments to improve the quality of life and enhance human performance with greater capabilities.  It is the only annual conference that brings together theoreticians and practitioners from a wide variety of disciplines to focus on the application of pervasive technologies to assistive environments.  Outcomes of this conference have a broad impact in diverse application areas such as manufacturing, transportation, energy systems, security and safety, robotics, healthcare, biomedicine, environment and conservation.  PETRA brings together very different types of technologies to also address important social and healthcare issues for sensitive populations, such as the elderly, or persons suffering from chronic conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Cerebral Palsy and other disabilities or traumas.  The PETRA proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library, and the authors of the best papers are invited to submit to special journal issues after the end of the conference.  More information about the conference may be found online at http://www.petrae.org.  The PETRA 2019 Doctoral Consortium will afford student authors of papers accepted for presentation at the conference a unique opportunity to gain additional exposure for their innovative ideas while also receiving reinforcement for the importance and value of conducting research with societal impact.  The workshop will allow the junior participants to create a social network both among themselves and with senior colleagues. The organizing committee will make a concerted effort to attract participants who are women, members of under-represented minorities, and persons with disabilities; to further assure diversity, NSF funds will be used to support no more than 2 student participants from any one institution, and if 2 students are supported, one of them must be a minority or person with disability.  To date, over 250 students based in U.S. educational institutions have been able to benefit from NSF support of the PETRA Doctoral Consortia.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the Doctoral Consortium, which will consist of special sessions at the beginning, during, and at the end of the conference, are to increase the exposure and visibility of the participants' work within the community, to help establish a sense of community among this next generation of researchers, and to help foster their research efforts by providing substantive feedback and guidance in a supportive and interactive environment from a group of senior researchers.  The special program organized for the students includes sessions between the doctoral students and the faculty mentors, in which the students will discuss their work and ask questions; the faculty mentors will provide constructive comments on the students' work and address their questions.  Each student will be asked to submit a report that provides feedback about the conference, regarding the benefits they received, which presentations they liked and why, and how certain papers and topics relate to their work. After they finish these reports, students will participate in small group breakout sessions to discuss them, and the faculty mentors will provide guidance on how to proceed for further journal publication.  Students will also have the option to submit a poster paper and to attend conference workshops on special topics.  Short papers on the participants' work will be published in the conference proceedings, and a summary report on the event will be posted on the conference website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

PETRA is an interdisciplinary conference that was launched in 2008.  It focuses on applying pervasive technologies to assistive environments in order to enhance human performance. It merges expertise and tools from many disciplines such as, machine learning, data mining, human robot interaction, computer vision, imaging, user interface design, networks, rehabilitation, human computer interaction, cognitive computing, neuroscience, manufacturing applications, and other areas. The results presented potentially impact different types of environments and applications, at home, in the workplace and in public spaces.   Many innovations and inventions have resulted from this conference, as well as many publications. \n\nThe objective of the PETRA conference is to stimulate interdisciplinary research that will help develop effective Assistive Technologies (AT) that improve the quality of life and overcome physical, cognitive and operational obstacles that prevent a human from reaching his/her full potential and achieve best performance.  PETRA findings addressed the needs of seniors and persons with special needs, such as providing safe in-home care for the elderly, or persons with Dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, chronic arthritis, PTSD, low vision, and other conditions. The aim is to improve the functional capabilities of people with disabilities, as well as enhance the productivity of well-bodied people. \n\n \n\nPETRA results have impacted diverse application areas.  Examples include, smart healthcare systems, vocational assessment, sensor-based training and rehabilitation, intelligent manufacturing, energy tracking and conservation, public and personal safety, transportation, robot-based training, virtual and augmented reality for job assessment, wearables, and other areas.  Petra authors presented results (see www.petrae.org) involving safety in smart homes, robot-based rehabilitation, physiological monitoring with wearables, multimodal assessment of mental health through gaming, gait analysis for persons with motor disabilities, and others.  \n\nConference results have had a significant computational impact on the development of new algorithms and methods that improve research.  Petra has also been successful in applying computational findings to solve problems found in other domains, such as psychology, neuroscience, and robotics, and have given technical insights to emerging social and ethical issues. PETRA 2019 had three keynote speakers and awarded four different awards for Best Technical Paper, Best Paper for Novelty, Best Student Paper, and Best Poster Paper. \n\n \n\nThe Doctoral Consortium (DC) and Student Author Travel Award for PETRA 2019 supported 13 student authors from 10 different US universities, who presented their work during the conference. Some student authors received additional funding from the Univ. of Texas Arlington College of Engineering.\n\n \n\nDuring the conference, several sessions were especially designed for the benefit of the NSF DC scholars, in order to allow them to describe their work, meet each other, exchange ideas and discuss challenges and opportunities in doing interdisciplinary research and receive feedback from participating faculty mentors.

The students learned about how to improve their presentation style and build confidence from this experience.\nThe DC students had the opportunity to network with students from other universities and share ideas and approaches for a successful career in computing and applications.\nThe students had one-on-one meetings with companies working on assistive technologies and with experts who helped them develop career models and gain motivation from opportunities available after graduation.\nThe students' scientific contributions were publicized widely through the PETRA conference ACM Digital Library proceedings that gave their work visibility. \nThe DC funding highlighted the support of NSF towards young researchers and gave visibility to the departments and institutions in the US where the students came from.\n\n\n \n\nConclusions: The project was very successful and beneficial to the DC students, helping them prepare for their thesis and future career. The aims of the project were achieved and the scope of the proposed work has been completed.  The PI does not anticipate any further action on this award.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/09/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Fillia S Makedon"
