 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanopositioning stages are mechanical devices used for precise positioning in a wide range of nanotech processes, ranging from spectroscopy to micro additive manufacturing. Hence, their precision, speed and cost are critical to precision engineering applications in the automotive, aerospace and defense industries, and therefore directly impact economic welfare and national security. Stages that use mechanical (i.e., sliding or rolling) bearings are currently the only commercially viable option for a growing number of large-displacement nanopositioning applications. However, mechanical bearing stages suffer from poor precision and low positioning speeds due to the adverse effects of friction. This award supports a scientific investigation into a simple but effective approach for mitigating the effects of pre-motion friction on mechanical bearing stages by connecting the bearing to the stage using a compliant joint. Knowledge created through this investigation will increase the positioning speed and precision of mechanical bearing stages without significantly increasing their cost, hence contributing to the commercial viability of nanotech processes. Its broader impact plan includes: (i) collaborations with Aerotech, Inc., a U.S.-based nanopositioning stage manufacturer, to facilitate knowledge and technology transfer; (ii) educational curriculum development at two universities and training of professional engineers through tutorials offered by the American Society for Precision Engineering; and (iii) outreach to underrepresented minority middle school students, aimed at inspiring and equipping the next generation of highly-skilled manufacturing engineers.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to gain a fundamental understanding of the dynamics and compensation of nonlinear pre-motion friction acting on a servo-controlled mass through a friction isolator. Empirical studies have demonstrated significant improvements in positioning precision and speed when a servo-controlled mass (e.g., a nanopositioning stage) interacts with nonlinear pre-motion friction through a friction isolator (i.e., a compliant joint).  However, very little is known about the dynamics of the friction isolator. The premise of this research is that, under certain circumstances, harmful dynamic phenomena (e.g., limit cycles) could occur when pre-motion friction acts on a servo-controlled mass through a friction isolator. This premise will be tested scientifically, to discover the harmful phenomena and circumstances that give rise to them, leading to insights on how to avoid them. To achieve this goal, mathematical characterizations of interactions between friction, friction isolator and servo parameters (e.g., mass, stiffness and damping) will be made using various tools, like the method of multiple scales, from nonlinear dynamic analysis. This will be complemented by rigorous numerical and physical experimentation on mechanical bearing nanopositioning stages, to guide, validate or refine the mathematical characterizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

They can be constructed using flexure, fluidic, magnetic or mechanical bearings. Of these choices, mechanical bearing NP (MB-NP) stages are the most cost effective, and are currently the only commercially viable option for a growing number of large-motion-range NP applications that must be performed in high vacuum environments. However, MB-NP stages experience nonlinear pre-motion (or 'static') friction arising from their inherent rolling elements, end seals/wipers, and lubricants. Pre-motion friction adversely affects the precision and speed of MB-NP stages, making them inferior to those of other bearing types. Model-based friction compensation methods are commonly used to address this problem. However, the methods suffer from very poor robustness and limited practicality due to the complexity and extreme variability of friction dynamics at the micro scale. The PI's research group observed in experiments that the effectiveness and robustness of model-based friction compensation could be greatly enhanced by connecting a mechanical bearing to a NP stage using a joint that is very compliant in the motion direction (and stiff in non-motion directions). Such a joint is called a friction isolator. The beauty of the friction isolator is that it is very simple and practical, and holds potential to deliver large improvements in the motion precision and speed of MB-NP stages at low cost.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyText-NoIndent\"><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p class=\"BodyText-NoIndent\">The objective of this research is to gain a fundamental understanding of the dynamics and compensation of nonlinear friction acting on a servo-controlled mass through a friction isolator (FI). Knowledge gained through this research will, at low cost, enable large improvements in the precision and motion speed of NP stages and other manufacturing machines guided by mechanical (i.e., rolling and sliding) bearings.

Linear stability analysis in the vicinity of equilibriums confirmed the numerical results. Further numerical studies showed that FI can reduce the amplitudes of limit cycles and prevent unbounded error, hence improve the precision of the motion stage.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyText-NoIndent\">As part of Task 2 of the proposed work, the effects of friction parameters on the stability of a precision motion system with and without a FI were analyzed theoretically and numerically. The following conclusions were reached:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The dynamics of a motion stage with FI share similar characteristics as that without FI. Unless a very large integral gain is used in the motion controller, the stability of the system under the PID controller is dominated by the proportional and derivative gains.</li>\n<li>The FI can increase the stability region of the controlled motion system. Large stiffness or damping of the FI may lead to larger regions for stable PID gain selection, in particular, allowing larger stable integral gain to be paired with small proportional and derivative gain for faster steady-state error convergence.
