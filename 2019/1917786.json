 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Instrumentation Programs. Professor Madalyn Radlauer from San Jose State University and colleagues Melanie McNeil, Chester Simocko and Eric Tillman are acquiring a gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) equipped with refractive index, ultrviolet and multiangle light scattering detectors. In general, gel permeation chromatography is used to separate compounds based on molecular weight, size, and shape.   The technique is commonly employed for the analysis or purification of polymers. The award support collaborations in polymer science between San Jose State University and Santa Clara University which promote research experiences for their large and diverse undergraduate student bodies. Summer research students are recruited from nearby community colleges thus expanding research training. The instrument gives students experience using vital instrumentation that they carry with them into their careers.\r\n\r\nThe award provides gel permeation chromatograph instrumentation useful for examining polymers used as catalyst scaffolds as well as for studies of precision polymers used for ion transport and energy storage. The GPC is employed in evaluating the effect of additives on the morphology and performance of polysulfone water purification membranes and for studying post-polymerization reactions leading to topological architectures such as cyclic polymers, star polymers, and branched polymers. The instrument is helpful for investigations of redox-active polymers used in organic batteries and other charge storage devices. Other uses of the GPC are for determining structure-property relationships of recycled polymers and composites. Finally, the instrument is used for studies of the effects of irradiation-based sterilization techniques on the properties of polymers used in implantable devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
