 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to test a newly developed instrument, named MethaneAIR, on the NSF Gulfstream-V aircraft.  This new instrument will measure carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere at a higher resolution than previously possible.  The design and acquisition of MethaneAIR is funded by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and private philanthropy, as part of the EDF International Methane project. MethaneAIR will provide new observing technology and research infrastructure for the atmospheric science community as well as opportunities for student education and research training and public engagement with science and technology.  \r\n\r\nThe MethaneAIR instrument consists of two imaging spectrometers that have been designed as the precursor to MethaneSAT, a small satellite intended to revolutionize measurements and modeling of emissions of CH4 from regional (100s of km) to fine scale (< 1 km) across the globe.  Two deployments of MethaneAIR are suggested to take place over Colorado on the NSF G-V aircraft during November 2019 and February 2020. In addition to high resolution measurements of the total-column dry air mole fraction of CH4 and CO2, the fine scale spatial and temporal variability of atmospheric airglow will be characterized and incorporated into retrievals of total column O2.  The research flights will incorporate emission surveys of major targets of interest, including the Julesburg Basin O&G field in Northeastern Colorado, the coal mines near Gillete-Campbell in Wyoming, and other targets along the Colorado Front Range such as cities, landfills, and cattle operations.  The EDF has committed to partnering with the broader community to apply these tools widely to atmospheric and environmental investigations. This project meets the criteria for an EAGER award because of its exploratory nature and the multiple engineering and science challenges that must be met.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It duplicates the spectroscopy of the upcoming MethaneSAT satellite (launch 2023).

Figures 3 and 4 show images of methane in the atmosphere over the Delaware oil and gas region on the TX-NM border, and over Salt Lake City. The images are created from tracks ~3.7 km wide, sampled from 43,000 feet. They show a full range of emission sources, from huge to relatively modest, as well as area-wide excess CH<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;due to diffuse emission sources. It took only 2.2 hours to obtain each of two 120x80 km images of the Delaware Basin. Salt Lake City took 90 minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">We also had two flights focusing on controlled releases of methane conducted near Midland, TX, by Adam Brandt?s group at Stanford. The results showed outstanding agreement between MAIR-derived emission rates and actual rates from 21 passes over the controlled releases (Figure 5).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The outcome of this grant is a powerful new capability for observing methane in the atmosphere. MAIR demonstrated exquisite accuracy and spatial resolution for methane measurements in a very wide swath. The sensor is both much more sensitive and much less expensive ( &lt; $1M) than previous remote sensing instruments for observing atmospheric methane. The successful development of MethaneAIR using philanthropic funding demonstrates that powerful remote sensing instrumentation is not the exclusive province of NASA programs; it can be within reach of the NSF community.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The completion of this NSF project launches MethaneAIR into future studies of emissions from oil and gas infrastructure, diverse urban sources.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/17/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Steven&nbsp;C&nbsp;Wofsy</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1856426/1856426_10589181_1650232165691_Slide2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1856426/1856426_10589181_1650232165691_Slide2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3.
