 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1\r\nAt its 2020 annual meeting, the GLOBE national and global education community will share current practices, research, and strategies for bringing Earth system education to more schools and citizen scientists around the world. This includes both data collection with popular GLOBE science protocols and protocols of interest to the community and best practices for integrating GLOBE into classrooms, informal education programs, with undergraduate students, with interested citizens and with the research community more broadly. Additionally, through a retrospective look at GLOBE over the 25 years of the program, participants will have the opportunity to learn about long-term involvement with GLOBE and how GLOBE has changed over the years. Through the work with the Diversity and Inclusion Task Force and its recommendations, participants will have the potential to reach even more people in their own communities. Additionally, students attending the meeting will obtain experience discussing their research with peers and scientists from around the world as well as tools on how to discuss Earth system science with their families and communities.\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\nAt the Annual Meeting, the theme of Reflecting on the Past, Looking to the Future will be explored further in multiple strands. These strands are: 1) A Welcoming GLOBE; 2) Collaborations Around the World; 3) 25 Years of GLOBE; and 4) The Next 25 Years. Additionally, trainers and mentor trainers will train participants in the top five GLOBE protocols and the top five requested protocols at the meeting. The GLOBE participants will learn about the GLOBE Diversity and Inclusion Task Force recommendations for making more GLOBE more welcoming and inclusive. GLOBE students will learn about science storytelling and how to share their knowledge with their schools, communities, and families. GLOBE teachers from non-traditional schools (e.g., schools focused on learners with disabilities, talented and gifted, etc.) will be invited to participate and share at the meeting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Three strands were developed that would showcase the work of the community especially in the COVID era.  These were STEM Teaching and GLOBE; A Welcoming GLOBE; and Responding to a Changing GLOBE.\n\n \n\nThe major goals associated with these strands were:\n\nto examine the use of GLOBE as a component of STEM Teaching,\nto create an even more inclusive, \u2018welcoming\u2019 environment within the GLOBE community as the diversity of countries continues to grow,\nshowing examples of how the community can utilize the program to respond to the many changes occurring in our world (scientific, environmental, social, etc.)\nto expand the number of community presentations over the previous meeting, as a way to increase community engagement with each other and the program, and\nto increase the interactivity of this virtual meeting over the previous one in 2020.\n\n\nStrands were integrated into the meeting agenda and each one had several sessions where community members presented their work in the local community in their countries.

Further sessions were available later in the day for networking and technology clinics.  The meeting included 66 sessions over the course of the week.  One hundred and fourteen adults presented on topics that spanned the three strands.   Forty student speakers showcased their IVSS projects for a total of 17 student presentations.\n\nAt the end of the meeting an evaluation form was disseminated to the attendees.  Results from the evaluation show that:\n\n94% of survey respondents [n=97] rated the overall event as \"Good\" or \"Excellent\"\nLess than 3% of survey respondents rated the event as below average\nThe event was exceedingly organized and managed in comparison to other virtual conferences they have attended\nOne barrier to participation during the meeting was that 20% of survey respondents had difficulties accessing sessions and content during the meeting.
