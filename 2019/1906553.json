 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently, there is no reliable test for early diagnosis of first time or recurrent epithelial ovarian cancers. This project will develop a new technique of micropipette thermography, which, if successful, will lead to new insights into mechanisms of cancer progression, early cancer detection, and early cancer diagnosis.  This research proposes that specific cell types possess characteristic responses to heat that can be used to identify the cell type. Characterization of this property may introduce a new class of cellular thermal markers for normal or diseased cells. Significant broader impacts included the training and mentorship of graduate, undergraduate and high school students in thermal sciences. This will occur through hands-on learning experiences in the nano and bioengineering program that will combine approaches from different fields of study to reveal information about a life process.\r\n\r\nThe current project objectives are: (1) to determine the thermal characterization profiles of a cell line panel of serous epithelial ovarian cancer progression. A 3D model of epithelial ovarian cancer will be prepared as a test bed. Microsensors and the accompanying technical method for both the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity from previous published work will be used on clinically relevant serous epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines; (2) to correlate the thermal characterization profile with the proliferation characterization profile as a Transition Prediction Model in epithelial ovarian cancer. Subsequent analysis of the thermal-probed cells will use fluorescence analysis to determine resazurin-detected proliferation. A linear regression analysis will be performed to determine whether the profiles for thermal characterization along with proliferation characterization are correlated with cancer transition. It is noted that novel thermal properties could supersede the current paradigm which emphasizes the reliance on extensive genomic and proteomic analyses. Moreover, the added value of this project is the identification of (and continued inquiry to understand) cellular inherent thermal properties. The technology and method, if successful, will allow for a non-invasive tool, faster diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer with expedited next step bio-specimen determinations for early validation of the method and technology. Indeed, this empirical study of thermodynamics cell properties will advance recently proposed theories of heat transfer roles in metabolic reprogramming, bioenergetics, and oxidation-reduction metabolism status in cancer cell survival.  This kind of novel discovery will open doors for new therapies. Furthermore, future real-time diagnosis at the location of the cells in question, when combined with laparoscopy, may result in early detection and diagnosis. This technology ostensibly will extend to other circulating blood tumors and disease models, providing for future advancements in cancer detection and therapy solutions. Underrepresented students will be the first-choice recruits through the University of North Texas McNair Scholars Program, National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates program. Texas Academy of Mathematics and Sciences high school program will also be included.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
