 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for a two-day workshop to be held at Boise State University. The workshop will convene teams funded through the EFMA Germination program together with other academic stakeholders (including senior leadership and individual researchers) to share the results obtained in their Germination-funded research. \r\n\r\nSpecific goals of the workshop include:\r\n1) Build community and support collaboration among Germination awardees.\r\n2) Share the outcomes and positive strategies of Germination-funded research projects.\r\n3) Explore ways that the Question Formulation Technique, developed by the Right Question Institute, can be applied to academic scholarship at a diversity of institutions.\r\n4) Share the effective practices learned at Boise State University during Germination-funded work.\r\n5) Consider ways to sustain, scale and disseminate successful Germination approaches.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will assist in building a community of practitioners committed to designing new learning frameworks, platforms, and/or environments for training academics to formulate research questions with substantive potential for societal impact. Successful scaling and implementation of these Germination approaches offers significant opportunity for broader impacts through catalyzing research directions that address pressing societal challenges and needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
