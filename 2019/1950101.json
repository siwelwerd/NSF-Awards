 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cold climate coastlines are highly vulnerable to reduced winter ice cover in response to climate change. Limited or variable shore ice cover results in enhanced storm-induced coastal erosion and damage to coastal infrastructure. The dynamics of how reduced ice cover influences coastal evolution is poorly understood which inhibits accurate forecasting of future coastal response in cold climates. This work aims to improve our fundamental understanding of how sediment interacts with shore ice as well as the resulting coastal landscape change. The first part of the project will involve laboratory experiments aimed at studying the physics of sediment and ice interactions. The second part of the project will gather field measurements that use the laboratory measurements as a basis to investigate how cold climate coastlines naturally respond to the shore ice. This study will result in a model that will help explain how reduced and variable winter shore ice cover alters the coastal landscape, which will help coastal managers proactively plan for future climate change impacts. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students who will be recruited from groups underrepresented in the STEM fields.  Public educational resources will be delivered to inner-city schools through partnership with Chicago Public Schools and will be shared nationally through The Scientific Research and Education Network (www.sciren.org), which is a science education non-profit founded by the PI.\r\n\r\nAccurate modeling of coastal evolution in cold climates is hindered by a limited understanding of the processes and responses associated with winter shore ice. This study will utilize unoccupied aerial and aquatic systems through a combined field and laboratory approach to test the hypothesis that variable ice cover is more erosive than consistent ice cover. This approach will yield the most comprehensive understanding to date of the morphodynamics of nearshore ice. Laboratory experiments in a frozen wave tank and ring shear apparatus will be used to constrain the forces required to entrain sediment within ice as well as the fundamental processes associated with transporting sediment-laden ice. Field investigations will be used to validate laboratory experiments as well as to describe the geomorphic processes and responses associated with shore ice. We will isolate the primary conditions facilitating sediment transport and shoreface geomorphic change during winter and resolve how the shoreface responds to these processes, which will provide the basis for models to include coastal evolution in cold temperature climates. The final result of this proposed study will be a conceptual model and set of empirically derived equations generated from the field and laboratory measurements that describe how shore ice drives sediment transport. This knowledge will be shared with practitioners through Great Lakes Coastal Zone Management Programs, local and regional stakeholder groups, and federal agencies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This shore ice can disrupt and alter sediment transport processes that occur in times or places where shore ice is absent. The alterations in associated sediment transport processes can fundamentally alter the coastal geomorphic response of these cold coast regions. An improved understanding of how ice affects the underlying sediment transport processes is necessary if we are to better constrain the future of cold coasts, especially as ice cover is becoming more irregular. At even a basic level the ability of the nearshore ice complex (NIC) to either protect or amplify beach erosion has been debated. Traditional notions include sediment entrained in ice is rafted and deposited beyond the depth of closure upon breakup, permanently removing that sediment from the sediment budget. Ice is also believed to protect beach erosion as it inhibits wave action from impacting the shallow portions of the beach. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This project combined four different components to assess the role of ice on coastal sediment transport 1) field measurements of coastal morphology before and after ice cover in the NAGL 2) collection of more than sixty ice cores from five different beaches that ranged from low to high energy beaches to characterize sediment content and ice structure 3) construction of a novel cryogenic wave tank in a large walk in freezer at UW-Madison and use of a novel cryogenic ring shear device to understand how sediment was mobilized due to the formation of the NIC 4) use of hydro- and morpho-dynamic numerical modeling to constrain and extrapolate the improved understanding from the field and laboratory observations to a wider range of scenarios. The field measurements showed that just outboard of the nearshore ice&rsquo;s maximum extent a trough was scoured into the lakebed and that the scoured sediment was transported into deeper waters where it was deposited (Fig. 1). Using the cryogenic wave tank, a scaled version of the nearshore ice complex (NIC) growth was created and the resulting effects on sediment transport were monitored. These results showed that the growth of the NIC caused wave energy to be deflected of the front of the NIC in a manner that scoured the bed immediately in front of the NIC (Fig. 2), in line with field observations.&nbsp; The cryogenic ring shear device was used to simulate how ice frozen directly to the beach in shallow waters, often called the icefoot, could be mobilized via wave actions. The ring shear results demonstrated that the sediment laden icefoot complex exhibited a Coulomb behavior when the icefoot was slipped atop the unfrozen beach sediment below (Fig. 3). These results allowed us to constrain the size of waves needed to mobilize the sediment in the icefoot, so that sediment laden ice could be rafted into deeper waters. The ice core collection from a variety of beaches showed that low energy beaches only entrain substantial volumes of sediment in areas where the beach freezes directly to the shore while the increased wave action on high energy beaches allows sediment to be entrained throughout the ice column (Fig. 4). In general, we found that on average 1% of the NIC mass is comprised from sediment and thus provides a rule of thumb for estimating the amount of sediment available to be rafted into deeper waters upon breakup of the NIC.&nbsp; Finally, the numerical modeling informed from field and laboratory observations demonstrated that in fact the wave energy upon striking the lakeward edge of the NIC is redirected to the base of the lakebed and scours away the bed.&nbsp; Interestingly the modeling showed there is a range of ice termination depths whereupon this sediment transport is maximized (Fig. 5). The results of this work were disseminated to multiple coastal hazard working groups and decision makers. The project also served as a means to work with undergraduate students from the College of Menominee Nation during a 12-week summer internship investigating coastal erosion in the NAGL (UW-Madison team). The results from the study were developed into outreach/education activities, such as virtual field trips, that were presented at the MSU Science Festival (MSU team). &nbsp;Overall, from this project the fundamental mechanism and role of ice on sediment transport have been determined. The results provide fundamental relationships that can be incorporated in morphodynamical models to assess the role of ice coverage, and importantly a means to assess how changes in ice coverage may affect coastal geomorphic change in the future.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/26/2024<br>\nModified by: Ethan&nbsp;J&nbsp;Theuerkauf</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950101/1950101_10606230_1732653248170_Fig_4--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950101/1950101_10606230_1732653248170_Fig_4--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1950101/1950101_10606230_1732653248170_Fig_4--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ice core pictures from Bay View Beach.
