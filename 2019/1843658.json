 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a novel wearable device for unobtrusively detecting changes in the lung health of patients with chronic respiratory disease. This Passive Unobtrusive Lung function Monitor (PULMO) will be the only device that can automatically measure a patient's lung health information without requiring any active engagement from the clinician, and without imposing any obtrusive changes to the patient's daily routine. The PULMO is useful in a broad range of respiratory disease applications, such as lung transplant post-operative care, asthma management and respiratory therapy research, that require continuous, objective and unobtrusive monitoring of lung function change. Since PULMO technology is compatible with low-cost microcontrollers, it has the potential to dominate the spirometry market and respiratory clinical trials space with high-volume production. The spirometry market has an expected CAGR of 9.4 % from 2018 to 2025, reaching a $1.4 billion market value by 2025, while clinical trials expenditures on new respiratory therapy drugs is forecast to reach $1.7 billion in 2025.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the major drawback of the state-of-the-art in continuous monitoring of respiratory disease, which is that it demands daily discipline, effort and proper technique of the patient, resulting in missing, invalid or fabricated data. In this project, a manufactured PULMO test device will be implemented with an intelligent event detection unit combined with a low power microcontroller, and the total average power consumption will be less than 300 microWatts. The measurement error of the PULMO will be within +/- 5 %, which is necessary for detecting changes in lung impairment. The intelligent event detection unit will be implemented as a nonlinear dynamical system in a custom integrated circuit. A gated recurrent neural network that is optimized for embedded low resource systems will be implemented in the low power microcontroller and will be used to detect respiratory disease symptoms. Controlled tests will be performed with a silicone phantom chest to evaluate the measurement accuracy of the PULMO device.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This goal is relevant because while there are several health applications that can benefit from remote monitoring of respiratory symptoms, solutions currently available on the market are either too bulky or power intensive to be used in an ambulatory setting for more than a day. To realize a long-term respiratory monitoring solution, this SBIR Phase I project tackled the technical challenge of building a small wearable respiratory monitor with a multiple day battery life. To that end, the project consisted of three core objectives: 1) designing and fabricating a wearable device, 2) developing an algorithm on device for detecting respiratory symptoms and 3) demonstrating device usability by conducting an ambulatory study.<span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The project resulted in the successful development of Ausculto: a prototype wearable device integrating a low-power embedded system for up to 3-days monitoring of respiratory metrics. Ausculto was designed to be worn either around the neck with a lanyard or directly on the chest via an adhesive. When worn, Ausculto is capable of capturing respiratory sounds such as cough and wheeze by means of contact and ambient acoustic sensors. The device also features motion sensors for capturing chest motion during tidal breathing, thus, enabling continuous ambulatory measurement of respiratory rate. Most crucially, Ausculto was developed to acquire these respiratory metrics within the critical constraints of size and battery life. The device was designed to be small and lightweight for comfortable and inconspicuous wear under clothing for an extended period. Furthermore, the hardware and electronics were implemented to extremely optimize power consumption while maintaining a miniature size. As a result, Ausculto is only a fraction of the size of existing technology for cough monitoring, yet achieves three times the battery life.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Another relevant component of the project involved devising a smart algorithm embedded on the device to enable the real-time detection and storage of respiratory sounds, specifically coughs. Traditionally, to monitor coughs, a wearable device would have to continuously record all audio from user for later post-processing and event detection on more powerful computers. However, in this project, a novel recurrent neural network specifically optimized for execution on ultra-low power devices was developed. Equipped with this neural network, a cough detection model was implemented on Ausculto which enables it to detect and store cough events in real-time while discarding everything else. And since storage is the most power intensive process, the ability to store only relevant events contributed immensely to Ausculto's extended battery life.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In addition to lab tests which benchmarked the performance of Ausculto and it's cough detection algorithms, an ambulatory study was conducted in both healthy volunteers and respiratory disease patients to verify the real-world performance and usability of the device. Ausculto was effective at detecting coughs in both cohorts and the battery lasted between 2 to 3 days across all subjects. More false positives were observed in the field than in the lab bench tests. However, this observation was expected since the detection model was bound to fail occasionally when it encountered certain unknown cough-like sounds in the wild. Falsely admitted events included sounds like laughter, infant crying and clanking of plates. Yet, only a few minutes of false events were admitted per day and battery life was not significantly impacted.
