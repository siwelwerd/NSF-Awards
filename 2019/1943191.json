This proposal will provide support to allow scientists to participate in this workshop.  Building on the success of a similar workshop in 2018, this year will double the number of participants from 50 to 100.  The requested funding will assist with covering the costs of hotel funds for all participants and for full travel funding for up to 10 participants with significant financial need.  Two workshops will take place in Boulder, CO, November 4-6 and November 5-8, 2019.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
