However, timing in the perceptual and cognitive sciences has historically been understudied. Understanding how this important facet of everyday life is accomplished requires a multidisciplinary approach across multiple domains. The Timing Research Forum conferences are designed to fill this need.  \r\n\r\nThis award provides support for US graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to travel to and attend the 2019 Timing Research Forum, October 15-18, 2019. One unique feature of the forum will be a 'Timing Moonshot' discussion, in which field leaders and conference participants will define the major problems and research agendas for the next five years.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
