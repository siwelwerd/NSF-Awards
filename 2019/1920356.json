 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant will support the acquisition of a multifunctional x-ray diffractometer, enhancing research and student training at California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB). This system will be used across a broad range of disciplines. In physics and chemistry, it will contribute to research on the development of new technological materials, including novel magnetic and ferroelectric systems. In geology, it will be an important tool in student and faculty research, primarily for the identification and characterization of rocks and minerals. Work performed using this instrument will significantly enhance the research infrastructure at CSUSB, particularly by furthering access to many experimental techniques (e.g. powder and thin film diffraction, reflectometry) applicable to a wide range of sample types (e.g. thin films, powders, polymers). CSUSB is an undergraduate-focused university and a qualifying Hispanic- and Minority-Serving Institution; thus, acquisition of this instrument will broaden participation of students from underrepresented demographics in state-of-the-art research, with a long-term impact of increasing diversity in STEM fields. Additionally, the ability to provide access to an advanced x-ray diffraction system will support the development of local collaborations with many institutions, including community colleges, other four-year universities, and local industries. Many of these education institutions and industries also serve minority populations that are underrepresented in the physical sciences, compounding the impact of this instrumentation in the development of a diverse STEM pipeline in the local area.\r\n\r\nThe diffractometer will be utilized for a variety of x-ray scattering techniques. Some of the major features of the instrument include a precision sample positioning stage and Eulerian cradle, enabling the performance of powder, thin film, and grazing incidence diffraction and reflectometry.  A Ge monochromator and pixel area detector will allow for high-resolution scanning and rapid collection of reciprocal space maps, and a multi-position automatic sample chamber will permit the rapid and automatic collection of powder diffraction patterns. These capabilities for rapid data collection and multi-sample analysis will significantly augment the team's research productivity, allowing time for more projects and broader impact of the machine. The diffractometer will enhance research output at CSUSB's NSF-CREST funded Center for Advanced Functional Materials (CAFM). The focus of the work will include: engineering novel ferroelectric and magnetic properties into single-crystal oxide thin films using epitaxial strain and multilayer geometry; optimizing organic ferroelectrics through preparation as thin films and novel polymer composites; and the identification and characterization of rocks and minerals in field and laboratory studies in geology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
