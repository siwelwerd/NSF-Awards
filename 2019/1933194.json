 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term impact of research in the mathematical sciences is often difficult to track, measure, and communicate. As a result, researchers or policymakers seeking to understand and assess the value of basic research may not fully appreciate the impact. In addition, stories highlighting how a mathematical discovery eventually leads to scientific discovery or a change in policy are infrequently identified and communicated for a general audience. Identifying and communicating these stories will increase appreciation for the value of mathematical sciences within research communities, encourage policymakers to support long-term investments in the mathematical sciences, and help mathematical sciences researchers better understand how their work connects to other domains, often in unexpected ways. Materials such as these will be a resource for research communities in explaining the roles and contributions of the mathematical sciences in a variety of sectors including the U.S. economy, national security, health and medicine, and other science, engineering, and technology domains. The stories will also improve collaboration among, and engagement of, stakeholders, policymakers, and researchers and help catalyze the mathematical science communities to advocate for and communicate the impact of their work on topics of national importance.\r\n\r\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Board on Mathematical Sciences and Analytics (BMSA) will convene an ad hoc committee with expertise in the mathematical sciences and science communication to conduct a study that will identify and illustrate the broad impact of the mathematical sciences in society. To complete the study, BMSA will facilitate the formation and operations of the ad hoc committee and will be responsible for printing and distribution of materials. To identify compelling narratives and graphics, the study committee will solicit suggestions from various stakeholders, including sponsors of research in the mathematical sciences, representatives from research institutes and national laboratories, researchers, and policymakers familiar with the mathematical sciences. The study will generate narratives and graphics for general audiences that demonstrate the fundamental role of the mathematical sciences in the U.S. economy, national security, health and medicine, and other science, engineering, and technology domains. These narratives and graphics will be summarized in a brochure designed for policymakers and adapted as a Web interactive infographic. In addition, the study will produce a short consensus report and a public webinar series for further explanation and exploration of the topics that are discussed. These materials can be used to convey the significance of mathematical discoveries to students, educators, policymakers, scientists, engineers, and other stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
