 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project comprises the development of a wearable system capable of accurately tracking glaucoma progression via continuous monitoring of intraocular pressure (IOP). Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world and affects nearly 80 million people worldwide. Using a novel wearable system, optometrists, ophthalmologists, and medical professionals across multiple disciplines can review the IOP trends at visits, monitor high-risk patients in real-time, and program patient-specific threshold alarms that will prevent irreversible blindness caused by glaucoma and related conditions. Through successful product commercialization, the novel wearable blindness prevention system (BPS) is expected to be adopted by approximately 2 million glaucoma patients annually. Users of the device will have continuous access to IOP data trends. Clinicians will be alerted when at-risk patients fail to comply with prescribed daily medicinal treatment (due to excessive IOP levels) and can continuously track the efficacy of prescribed IOP-lowering treatments. Finally, the IOP tracking capability of the system will allow improvements in the quality of care for general clinicians, medical specialists, and clinical researchers and will be a major player in the current move toward data-driven, value care.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project centers on laboratory feasibility testing of the fundamental concept behind the novel blindness prevention system technology - image-based pressure sensing - on a benchtop 3D-printed glaucoma simulator that is monitored using an alpha prototype of the system.  The research plan includes testing of the feasibility of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera which fits inside a pair of eyeglass frames, plus processor, optics, and software, as a way to record pressure changes in eye tissue in a benchtop environment. The key objective is to accurately - and with high repeatability - detect unhealthy eye pressure levels in the simulator using an alpha prototype, a-BPS, that communicates with a standard mobile device.  The target research outcome for the a-BPS is to successfully trigger a high-pressure alarm in a repeatable manner whenever eye pressure in the simulator exceeds a clinically-relevant threshold. It is anticipated that the Phase I research results will show successfully operation in 90% or more of the test samples. The output from the Phase I effort will be used as design inputs for a Phase II prototype, which will be wearable and will allow testing on humans.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The a-BPS is an early R&amp;D effort aimed at developing a cloud-based, wearable eye pressure (\"intraocular pressure\"&nbsp; or \"IOP\") monitoring system using eyeglass frames embedded with imaging sensors that photograph the exposed sclera of the eye - mainly near the limbus. Glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness, has an unknown cause and affects more than 70 million people worldwide. Currently, there is no cure for glaucoma, but early and proper treatment can often save one&prime;s vision.&nbsp; Eye pressure is, by far, the most commonly used measure for predicting and monitoring glaucoma. The wearable technology developed under this SBIR project carries the potential to monitor eye pressure throughout the day and allow clinicians to provide a higher quality of care for at-risk patients.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br />The BPS system, which includes miniature cameras and supporting electronics embedded into eyeglass frames of conventional appearance and form factor, collects images of the eye during normal day-to-day activities.&nbsp; The system uses an algorithm to track physical spacing between features in order to quantify tissue expansion as a percentage, i.e. scleral strain. Calibration of one&prime;s scleral strain with IOP using a known IOP device, such as an air puff tonometer (APT) or Goldmann tonometer, allows for the conversion of one&prime;s scleral strain to IOP. The Phase I testing effort included a series of experimental studies aimed at mitigating technical risk associated with the BPS technology. The experimental work included characterization of commercially available CMOS sensors that are at the proper size scale, e.g. fit within the size restrictions associated with nominal eyeglass frames - about 4 mm or smaller, as well as in vitro system testing on pig eyes through a custom benchtop glaucoma simulator.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp; <br />Images of pig eyes under various anatomical pressures were captured using the selected image sensors and computer code was developed that calculates pressure based on the mechanical strain (tissue expansion) observed in the imagery. Results from nine eyes tested yield very good agreement between IOP calculated using the a-BPS and the true IOP as measured from a benchtop water column with a digital pressure sensor. There were 17 eyes tested in all and all had visible expansion at elevated IOP. Of the 17, nine were specifically used for IOP testing with the rest being used for protocol development, depth of field scanning and/or algorithm testing. The results showed that, of these nine eyes tested, all eyes were able to successfully track high IOP.&nbsp; For a laboratory IOP of 28 mmHg applied to each eye, the imaging algorithm calculated IOP to within 1.5 mmHg.&nbsp; Additionally, we have created a pixel focus algorithm that creates a frame positioning warning in the event the eyeglass frames are not residing in their proper position.
