 "awd_abstract_narration": "This STTR Phase 2 project is aimed at providing technology to address the high costs of developing effective and safe drugs. Bringing a new drug to market typically involves screening 100's of thousands of compounds for efficacy and toxicity utilizing cell, tissue and animal models to ultimately select a lead compound that will be tested in clinical trials. This process can take years, billions of dollars, and in the worse case leads to compounds that fail during clinical trials due to safety concerns. Advances in microfluidics and 3D-printing have enabled the construction of tissue culture devices with nearly unlimited numbers of tissue chambers and flow channel complexity. Combined with optical sensors with unprecedented sensitivity, instrumentation can be built that maintain large numbers of biopsied tissue samples, while assessing the effects of exposure of the tissue to libraries of drugs. This technological platform provides resolution of drug effects on human tissue with high sensitivity thereby reducing the cost of animal testing and the risk of bringing toxic drugs to clinical trials and the market. In addition, the technology will impact the fields of personalized medicine, where drugs could be tested on an individual's own tumor or tissue, and environmental health.\r\n\r\nMeasuring in vitro cellular responses to pharmaceutical compounds is critical for identifying toxic effects of candidate drugs prior to costly in vivo animal and clinical testing. To address this need, instrumentation to maintain and assess biopsied tissue in real time is being developed. The technology utilizes microfluidics for optimal maintenance of tissue viability and function, and optoelectronics to measure oxygen uptake with unprecedented sensitivity. The fluidics are driven by gas pressure, circumventing the need for unwieldy pumps, and the channels are fabricated by 3D printing, allowing for nearly unlimited numbers of chambers and flow channel complexity. The technological platform will aid in the selection of lead compounds for clinical trials, estimation of doses for first-in-human tests, and support applications to the FDA. In this Phase 2 STTR proposal, the company will build two 96-channel turnkey instruments for a contract research program and for beta testing by pharmaceutical companies. The functionality of a low-capacity (16- channel) system has been previously demonstrated. The funding will support scaling up the throughput of the system as well as enabling additional modes of operation. The instrumentation will be used for contract research and for direct sales to the large market of drug discovery within the pharmaceutical industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe BaroFuse, A Multi-Channel Fluidics System for Investigating the Response of Cell/Tissue Function to Test Compounds ? EnTox Sciences, Inc\n\nAnimal research and human clinical trials are expensive, slow, and have limited ability to reveal molecular mechanisms that are mediating responses. In addition, results in animal studies don?t always predict human results and there are ethical reasons for minimizing experimentation on live animals. Thus, there is a need for methods to assess the response of biopsied or isolated tissue to experimental compounds, particularly for basic biomedical research, drug development and personalized medicine.  However, most systems used to measure cell function are done in wells with no flow.  To maintain tissue viability and function in culture, it is necessary to use fluid flow to deliver enough oxygen to keep the tissue alive and functional.  Microfluidics systems are being developed to culture cell models of tissue for extended periods of time.  However, their utility is greatly limited by high expense and lack of continuous assessment to monitor the changes in tissue function in response to test compounds.  Therefore, there has not been widespread adoption of microfluidic technology by the life sciences fields for routine analysis of cellular metabolism and function.\n\nThe goal of this proposal was to meet the challenge of developing and commercializing a multi-channel fluidics system that is easy and inexpensive to use to maintain tissue and assess its responses, has a quick turnaround, and assesses a full panel of real time informative readouts that reflect metabolic activity, cell signals and functional output. These specifications were met by novel and innovative designs in large part based on the capability of 3D printers to print multichannel fluidics systems of great geometric complexity while accommodating sensors within the flow streams.  The operation of the BaroFuse was greatly simplified by using gas pressure instead of mechanical pumps to drive microflow of liquid. The instrument requires only two 3D-printed parts to support large numbers of flow channels.  Additional components of the BaroFuse include ultra-stable multidetector O2 sensors, rapid injector of test compounds, automated flow rate detection and outflow fraction collection, a gas equilibration system for dissolving O2 and CO2, and experiments driven by user inputs to sophisticated software.  The system needs about 45 minutes for setup and requires only small amounts of tissue allowing for high numbers of samples even with small tissue biopsies or scarce tissue.\n\nWith these components, operation of the BaroFuse yields 8- to 16-channel real-time readouts of O2 consumption and lactate production (reflecting metabolism and viability), collection of fractions for subsequent assay of cell signals (cAMP and cGMP) and measurement of hormone and neurotransmitter secretion (such as insulin, glucagon, acetylcholine and glutamate).   This system has now been beta-tested for operability and utility, and after a 4-week training period, the system runs reliably and generates very accurate and informative data.  It has been found to work well with a wide range of biological samples including retina, eyecups, retinal pigment epithelial cells, liver, islets, brain, heart as well as cell lines.  The BaroFuse is now on the market and 6 of them are in use in research laboratories to answer questions involving the role of metabolic dysregulation in various diseases causing blindness, and in pancreatic islets for groups investigating inadequate insulin secretion in diabetes.  The simultaneous measurement of multiple parameters is particularly informative for academic research laboratories. Having surveyed active research institutions in the country and globally (which number in the hundreds), we predict a large impact in many fields of life science research including but not limited to the study of diabetes, blindness, cancer, heart disease and obesity.\n\nThe utility of the BaroFuse makes it a powerful tool for the Pharmaceutical industry for testing of drug toxicity. It can be used to evaluate candidates for clinical trials where preclinical testing cuts down on animal testing and clinical trials.
