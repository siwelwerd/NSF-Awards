 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase II project continues an ambitious project to create an entirely new way of doing mathematics. It leverages off the recipients' previous projects that resulted in an interactive equation manipulation system and a mathematics communication system. This project expands the technology into a comprehensive platform for learning, doing, and communicating mathematics. The innovation directly addresses deficiencies in STEM education and educational technology products by providing a tool whereby users can learn math by exploration and rapidly develop an intuitive understanding of how equations work through discovery. As such, it opens the creative doors to the world of mathematics to a wide range of students who might otherwise slip through the cracks of traditional mathematics education simply because they think differently. The net impact on society is a lower barrier to entry to STEM fields and an increase in math literacy - thus helping to maintain our standing as global leaders in innovation. \r\n\r\nThis project researches and develops a comprehensive modern mathematics system for students and professionals to effortlessly explore and solve complex equations through a simple and artful interface, elegant design, and powerful math engine. It expands on the recipient's already unique product offerings to create a transformative mathematics platform. The platform is an innovative new way of doing math that allows users to enter any equation on almost any device, and solve it using simple drag-and-drop gestures. Its freeform approach to computer algebra retains the exploratory aspects of pen-and-paper calculations, while benefiting from the computational prowess of the underlying math engine. With a unique user interface and networked multiplayer support, it is also a powerful real-time communication and collaboration tool. This project drastically enlarges the breadth of the technology by focusing on critical tasks in three core areas of development: expanding its core mathematics features, maturing its peer-to-peer math communication system, and structuring its overall system architecture. The project prepares the platform for a precise product-market fit to target school districts for direct licensing, and online education companies for partnership.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
