The project received 606 applications from 42 states, despite the COVID-19 disruption, and supported 36 undergraduate students in four separate cohorts from 2019 to 2023. The 2020 REU summer program had to be canceled due to the burst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among 36 REU student participants, 19 are female students and 19 are from minority ethnic groups including Hispanic, Black, Asian, and Middle Eastern. In addition, 17 students were recruited from small colleges and universities including community colleges which provide very limited or no research opportunities.</p>\n<p>The 36 REU students participated in a 10-week intense summer research program under the supervision of 14 faculty members at the Department of Chemistry. Students worked closely with their faculty mentors and graduate students in the labs to conduct original research in chemistry and biochemistry. The research projects cover a broad range of topics: from&nbsp;molecular dynamic simulations to experimental investigations of protein-metal, protein-protein, and protein-ligand interactions, from traditional organic and inorganic synthesis to metal and enzymatic catalysis. All students were trained in general research philosophies including responsible conduct of research and lab safety and chemical hygiene. Through developing research proposals, conducting laboratory experiments, performing theoretical calculations, presenting at conferences and symposiums, and preparing final formal research reports or manuscripts for publication, students gained a deeper understanding of the nature and format of scientific research, acquired various fundamental research skills including specific laboratory techniques and presentation and writing skills, and improved their independent thinking and research ability. REU students were able to explore at the frontiers of chemical and biochemical research fields and generated new and interesting results, which were either presented at conferences or published in peer-reviewed journals. So far, REU students have made 59 presentations at local, regional, and national conferences and symposiums and coauthored 10 papers and reprints.</p>\n<p>REU students gained additional skills and knowledge by attending a series of well-structured professional development activities. Besides trainings on responsible conduct of research and lab safety and chemical hygiene, seminars and talks by faculty members were organized to discuss on a series of important topics, such as woman&rsquo;s career development in chemistry, equity and diversity in STEM, and persuasive scientific presentations. Workshops were also organized for applications to graduate schools and interviews for research job positions. To enhance students&rsquo; professional developments, a few of educational and fun field trips were organized. For example, they visited local pharmaceutical companies to learn about the research and development in industry and the concept of cGMP (current good manufacturing practices), had a tour of the Wright Brothers National Memorial in Outer Banks to experience the national pride, and had a guided tour to the ECU Coastal Studies Institute at ECU Outer Banks campus to learn about the needs, issues, and concerns of coastal North Carolinians and the mission of the institute.</p>\n<p>One of the main goals of the project is to encourage students to pursue an advanced degree in chemistry and biochemistry. Nearly all REU students expressed their interest in pursuing an MS or Ph.D. degree in chemistry or biochemistry after the REU experience, with several being interested in medical schools. So far, 16 former REU students have joined graduate programs pursuing their MS or Ph.D. degrees and two are in medical schools to pursue an MD degree. A complete data would be expected several years later because some of them are still in their senior year or are applying to a graduate school, but for the 2019 cohort, 8 out of 10 students went to graduate schools and 7 were in Ph.D. programs in chemistry-related fields and one was in biology MS program. These students will eventually join the great effort to strengthen and diversify the national workforce in chemistry and biochemistry.</p>\n<p>This project also had a profound impact on personal developments. Students have improved their social and organizational skills through attending various social activities and performing multi-task projects. Through collaborations with their mentors and other researchers, students learned the importance of teamwork in solving a complex scientific problem and interdisciplinary collaborations. A quote from the student survey may speak the best, &ldquo;I will be so grateful for this experience. Not only have I gained a better understanding of my research project, but I have personally grown into a better individual.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 06/03/2024<br>\nModified by: Shouquan&nbsp;Huo</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851844/1851844_10594064_1717444324201_Image_1a--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851844/1851844_10594064_1717444324201_Image_1a--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REU group and research photos\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851844/1851844_10594064_1717444324201_Image_1a--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REU group and research photos\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2019, 2022, and 2023 REU cohorts (Top left to right, no group photos taken for the 2021 cohort) and REU students performing computational (bottom left) and experimental (bottom right) research in chemistry and biochemistry</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shouquan Huo, Taylor Harris, Rhett Butler</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shouquan&nbsp;Huo\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REU group and research photos</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851844/1851844_10594064_1717444468402_Image_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851844/1851844_10594064_1717444468402_Image_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REU students at conferences\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851844/1851844_10594064_1717444468402_Image_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REU students at conferences\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU students were presenting their research findings at conferences and symposiums</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shouquan Huo, Yumin Li</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shouquan&nbsp;Huo\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REU students at conferences</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851844/1851844_10594064_1717444538433_Image_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851844/1851844_10594064_1717444538433_Image_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Professional development activities\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1851844/1851844_10594064_1717444538433_Image_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Professional development activities\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU students were participating in professional development activities</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shouquan Huo, Yumin Li</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shouquan&nbsp;Huo\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Professional development activities</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
