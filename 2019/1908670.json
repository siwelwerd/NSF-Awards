 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current priorities in science education include efforts to engage students in scientific reasoning and using the knowledge and practices of science to understand natural phenomena and constructively respond to local and global challenges. This project responds to these priorities by developing and testing a place-based environmental science research and monitoring program for elementary school students and their teachers. Students will investigate locally-relevant phenomena related to forest health, such as fire management and invasive species. The students will collect and analyze data related to resource management issues and share findings with community scientists and stakeholders. The project will develop and test a reproducible and adaptable place-based instructional model for schools, districts, and counties having underserved rural populations.\r\n\r\nThis early stage design and development project for students and teachers of grades 3-5 addresses two major goals: 1) Design and implement a science education program focused on local forest management issues to promote community-relevant learning and agency, and 2) Conduct design-based research to identify effective approaches to engaging young students in purposeful data collection and interpretation, and informed interaction with local stakeholders. The study includes 15 comprehensive public schools and charter schools in 12 school districts in a rural region having limited access to the formal and informal science learning opportunities typically available in urban centers. Research activities are guided by two research questions: 1) To what extent and in what ways do students participating in a school-based, community-engaged, place-based, environmental-focused program develop environmental science agency? And 2) Which design variations of the three Central Design Features foster the three science learning outcomes for students? The three Central Desig Features are: 1) Collecting place-relevant environmental data, 2) Facilitated meaning-making with collected data embedded within larger data sets, and 3) Community-engaged, place-based projects and interactions. A design-based research approach will be used to  determine how the planned design variations impact learning. The project will involve three design cycles of two-years each, with adjustments being based on insights gained during each implementation cycle. Pre- and post-program sureveys will be used to track changes in student environmental science agency (ESA), and field observations, semi-structured interviews with students and teachers, and examination of student work and artifacts will be used to gather data used to answer the research questions.\r\n\r\nThe Discovery Research PreK-12 Program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nCommunity and Citizen Science (CCS) engages young people in real scientific research and monitoring while enhancing their science learning and environmental stewardship. Through our five-year Research-Practice Partnership project, called Our Forests, we examined elementary students understanding of, and agency with, environmental science content knowledge and practices through their participation in a year-long forest monitoring program in the Sierra Nevada foothills that included not just data collection but also analysis and sharing findings with meaningful audiences.\r\n\n\nWe developed and studied a replicable model for science standards-aligned, school-based CCS by working with teachers and 3rd-5th graders, who conducted locally-relevant monitoring of forest health for wildfire risk. The program consisted of 3 field trips and 8 classroom lessons all focused on 3 Central Design Features following the full data life-cycle, during which students: 1) collect ecological data, 2) analyze data, and 3) share their findingswith scientific community partners, focused on community-identified resource management issues at sites on or near their school campuses. Scientific community partners (CPs) were non-profit and agency staff that owned or managed the forested land and partnered with classrooms.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nIntellectual merit\r\n\n\nOur design-based research included two design cycles and examined learning outcomes focused on environmental science agency (ESA) which includes students: 1) understanding science content and practices asligned with Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), 2) identifying their roles and expertise in science and 3) agency to use this environmental science to benefit their communities and environment.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe study employed field observations, surveys, and interviews with students to answer the following questions: 1) To what extent and in what ways do students participating in an environmental CCS program develop aspects of environmental science agency (ESA)? 2) Which Design Variations of our three YCCS Central Design Features above foster aspects of ESA?\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe found that several aspects of participation in the full data life-cycle of forest monitoring influenced student learning when designed with crucial involvement by scientific community partners. Specifically, we discovered:\r\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nWhen students engaged in place-based data collection, repeated experiences allowed them to develop roles and expertise in using the forest measuring tools; extended duration allowed them to practice the formal protocols and explore and investigate their own questions. Students took responsibility for the data quality and cared about the purpose of the data to contribute to their scientific community partners. Engaging in data collection about their forests in the context of wildfire enhanced students' systems thinking skills and understanding of their own socio-ecological systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nWhen students engaged in analysis and meaning-making with data, comparing data between managed and unmanaged forest plots provided real world context for drawing evidence-based claims. Data analysis enhanced their data literacies and helped them see usefulness of scientific data to understand their forest systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nWhen students shared their analyzed data, observations, and management suggestions with scientific community partners, students built connections between their science learning and real-world applications. Interactions between the community partners and students could foster, or hinder, learning opportunities, depending on whether partners encouraged dialogue vs. lecturing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe used these findings to create a Guide, Curriculum, Research Briefs, and Protocols for educators and other practitioners in CCS to design and implement high quality science education programming.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nYouth Community Science and Action in Our Forests Curriculumfor 3rd, 4th, and 5th Grades\r\n\n\nOn the Our Forests website, the curriculum features 5 modules with 14 lessons for each of the three grade levels. The modules use activities, slide-shows, inquiry-based pedagogical guidelines and supports for teachers. The curriculum outlines NGSS connections as well as connections to ELA standards, math standards, and Universal Design for Learning Guidelines.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nGuide for Designing Environmental Community Science Programs with Schools\r\n\n\nThis Guide combines the current research on the benefits of youth-focused community and citizen science with practical guidance gained through the Our Forests project, with examples from the project. Chapters focus on key aspects of designing a program:\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nCentering the Student experience\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nDeveloping relationships with Scientific Community Partners\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nStudents collecting environmental monitoring data\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nStudents analyzing environmental monitoring data\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nStudents sharing environmental monitoring data with Scientific Community Partners and other outside audiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\nThe broader impacts of this work occur at multiple scales. Our project has had immediate school, district- and county-wide impacts, including ongoing Our Forests based workshops with the Nevada County Office of Education. More than 25 teachers, working with more than 750 students, received training, support, and resources, an investment that will have lasting impacts throughout the county through leadership, mentorship, and built capacity. Beyond, our research findings about how to best design CCS programs for elementary students in collaboration with schools, contributes to the educator practices and research in the science education field that support NGSS implementation in schools. These informed an adaptable model for CCS with schools for educators accessible in the Our Forests Curriculum and Guide (https://sites.google.com/ucdavis.edu/our-forests/home). \t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SolHenson\n"
