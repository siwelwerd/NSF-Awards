 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the \"Tough as Nails, Nimble Fingers Research Practitioner Partnership (RPP)\" is to develop a pipeline for computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education within Pikeville Independent Schools and Floyd County K-8 schools.  Kentucky Appalachia K-8 instructors will learn the basics of CS and CT and how to integrate these skills and concepts into existing coursework.  Through the professional development and curricular model of South Fayette School District (a national leader in CS/CT education) and wider support from local company Bit Source, Pikeville Independent School district and Floyd County schools will develop their own CS/CT pathways, grounding coursework and learning competencies in the educational and economic needs of their respective communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
