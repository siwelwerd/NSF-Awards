 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sun Valley Workshop on Musculoskeletal Biology emphasizes active participation of junior faculty and students/fellows. Funds from this award will support competitive travel awards for junior investigators who will be able to present their research to a multidisciplinary audience and network with leaders in the field.  Travel award recipients will also participate in one-on-one mentoring with senior investigators.  The workshop will be organized around problem solving and extensive discussion, rather than just presentation. The meeting will include a program to highlight posters presented at the workshop: \"Blue Ribbon Sun Valley Posters.\" Ten posters will be chosen for 3 minute summary presentations by the authors. The intent is to highlight the most significant posters, in many cases young investigator posters, and generate interest in visiting the posters.  Career and professional development sessions, including \"Navigating the FDA\" and \"Career Transitions: Planning and Negotiating for Career Advancement,\" are planned. \r\n\r\nThe musculoskeletal system (muscles, tendon, bone) is highly sensitive to mechanical load, and many younger investigators from previous Sun Valley meetings have submitted applications to the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology program. This workshop continues as one of the important training venues for future scientists in the area of mechanobiology of the musculoskeletal system based on its unique problem solving focus and the multidisciplinary group of participants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
