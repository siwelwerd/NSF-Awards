 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this award is to fund a meeting for materials researchers in the realm of 2 dimensional materials to envision how data sciences can contribute to the development of this discipline to elucidate structure/processing/property correlations. At present, many materials problems of technological relevance suffer from lack of data frameworks. Indeed, lack of adequate frameworks to process, curate, and share complex raw data hinders progress in this field, ultimately not realizing the promise of 2 dimensional materials commercial technologies.  In short, materials scientists are inundated with multi-dimensional data from many sources, both experimental and computational, and vast amounts of data are under-utilized, repeatedly acquired, or thrown out completely. \r\nThe purpose of this workshop is to build the needed framework towards sound data schemes and repositories in the realm of 2 dimensional materials.\r\n\r\nThis meeting is the first intervention on the PIs of the recently constituted NSF-2D Data Framework (2DDF), which will be complemented by further PI meetings as well as events for students and post-docs to provide training and implement the vision developed by PIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
