 "awd_abstract_narration": "Critical applications are emerging in the interdisciplinary field of Data Science in the area of community health analytics. Yet despite the high potential impacts of data science on the community, not enough opportunities for undergraduate education and research immersion in data science are available. Supporting communities in the digital age rests on comprehensive data science solutions from machine learning, artificial intelligence to big data technologies.  With an interdisciplinary team, participants in this project improve the state-of-art in data science to solve real-world problems from personalized health and well-being, public health by mental health screening tools, early alerts for infection spread, to environmental and transportation improvements. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site helps to sustain our community's innovation-based economy by training students to acquire data science skills. This site provides access to data science research opportunities otherwise extremely limited. A goal is to boost retention of female students and underrepresented groups such as African Americans in  Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) professions. Undergraduate research programs are known to improve students' interpersonal communication, professional networking, and research skills that they would not encounter in the classroom, and to encourage students to find their interest and seriously consider graduate studies. \r\n\r\nThis REU site is a continuation of an REU site in Data Science successfully operated by the Worcester Polytechnic Institute Data Science program since 2016. This new site offers 30 additional students from a range of geographically diverse locations around the country access to vibrant scientific research projects and undergraduate mentorship. Comprehensive support for the REU participants, from close research mentoring to professional development, are provided. Students have the opportunity to network with professionals from the data science advisory board, alumni and industrial partners from companies and organizations as diverse as Google, MathWorks, and MITRE Corporation, thereby encouraging them to pursue Data Science in their careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The REU site has provided students with access to vibrant scientific research projects and undergraduate mentorship at which WPI excels. Participants in the WPI REU site have researched the fundamental scientific principles governing analytics in impactful projects. The site provided comprehensive support for the REU participants from close research mentoring to professional development. Students have had the opportunity to network with professionals at various industry network events, thereby encouraging them to pursue Data Science in their careers. Thus, we enrich the professional lives of the REU participants, as the program has encouraged students to consider graduate advanced degrees in STEM fields. Several students accepted internships in the STEM companies we visited through our REU field trips the subsequent summer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Impact on Diversity and URM Representation</strong>. This site has aimed to boost retention of URM members, especially of Hispanic, African American, female students and members of other under-represented groups in STEM professions by inviting students to become part of a thriving research community for a summer, while also observing a variety of different STEM pathways. &nbsp;Within these five years from summer 2019 to 2023, 562 students have applied to our REU program. More than 43% of the applicants were female, showing robust interest from female students. Over 54% of the applicants were URM members, including African American, Hispanic, Latino, Native American, and Pacific Islander (compared to less than 29% from the 2016-2019 REU Site). Among 562 applicants, 35 highly qualified students (10 each year plus 5 on REU Site Supplements) were chosen to join our summer program. Of these 35 students, 20 students identified as female and 15 identified as male. In addition, 15 of the 35 students (over 42%) identified as underrepresented in STEM, i.e., female, African American or Hispanic. Students were recruited from local institutions as well as national level universities to assure geographic diversity, with our 35 students coming from 28 institutions spread across 14 distinct states. &nbsp;We offered the participants professional development activities to facilitate future entry into rewarding professional careers. Our program improved their communication skills, professional networking skills, broadened their knowledge base, helped them become self-directed researchers, and encouraged students to better find their interest and more seriously consider graduate studies. In an exit survey, the vast majority of participants indicated that our site met or exceeded their expectations both professionally and personally.</p>\n<p>In summary, this DS REU Site has addressed a critical need to give talented students, including female and URM, the opportunity to engage in state-of-the-art research in a STEM field of great importance and with the potential for discovering future leadership career opportunities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/11/2024<br>\nModified by: Elke&nbsp;A&nbsp;Rundensteiner</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div
