The 2019 BEST meeting will take place in Ashland, Oregon, on the campus of Southern Oregon University, during June 19-21. BEST is an international conference featuring talks on a broad range of recent advances in set theory research. It particularly aims to support the careers of young researchers in set theory. The conference is organized in Boise, ID and is structured as a symposium of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Pacific Division (AAAS-PD). For more information please visit https://math.boisestate.edu/best.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
