 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will create opportunities for teachers to develop programming content knowledge and new understandings of the creative possibilities in computer science education, thereby increasing opportunities for students to develop conceptual and creative fluency with programming. K-12 introductory programming experiences are often highly scaffolded, and it can be challenging for students to transition from constrained exercises to open-ended programming activities encountered later in-and out of-school. Teachers can provide critical support to help students solve problems and develop the cognitive, social, and emotional capacities required for conceptually and creatively complex programming challenges. Teachers - particularly elementary and middle school teachers, especially in rural and Title I schools - often lack the programming content knowledge, skills, and practices needed to support deeper and more meaningful programming experiences for students. Professional development opportunities can cultivate teacher expertise, especially when supported by curricular materials that bridge teachers' professional learning and students' classroom learning. This research responds to these needs, addressing key national priorities for increasing access to high-quality K-12 computer science education for all students through teacher professional development.\r\n\r\nThe project will involve the design and evaluation of (1) an online learning experience for teachers to develop conceptual and creative fluency through short, daily programming prompts (featuring the Scratch programming environment), and (2) educative curricular materials for the classroom (based on the online experience). The online experience and curricular materials will be developed in collaboration with three 4th through 6th-grade rural or Title I teachers. The project will evaluate teacher learning in the online experience using mixed-methods analyses of pre/post-survey data of teachers' perceived expertise and quantitative analyses of teachers' programs and evolving conceptual knowledge. Three additional 4th through 6th-grade teachers will pilot the curricular materials in their classrooms. The six pilot teachers will maintain field journals about their experiences and will participate in interviews, evaluating use of the resources in practice. An ethnography of one teacher's classroom will be developed to further contribute to understandings of the classroom-level resources in action, including students' experiences and learning. Student learning will be evaluated through student interviews and analyses of student projects. Project outcomes will inform how computer science conceptual knowledge and creative fluency can be developed both for teachers and their students' knowledge and fluency that will be critical for students' future success in work and life.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

K-12 introductory programming experiences are often highly scaffolded, and it can be challenging for students to transition from constrained exercises to open-ended programming activities encountered later in and out of school. Problem-solving strategies and debugging are essential practices for computer programming and computational thinking. Teachers can provide critical support to help students solve problems and develop the cognitive, social, and emotional capacities required for conceptually and creatively complex programming challenges. Professional development opportunities can cultivate teacher expertise, especially when supported by curricular materials that bridge teachers' professional learning and students' classroom learning.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project responded to these needs, addressing key national priorities for increasing access to high-quality K-12 computer science education for all students, through teacher professional development and the development of new curriculum materials. This award supported the design and evaluation of Getting Unstuck, which consisted of two components: (1) an online learning experience for teachers to develop fluency with the Scratch programming environment through short programming projects, and (2) a 10-module intermediate computing curriculum to help teachers and students develop greater fluency with Scratch. The curriculum, which is available at <a href=\"https://gettingunstuck.gse.harvard.edu\">https://gettingunstuck.gse.harvard.edu</a>, reimagines the classroom as a design studio: a culture of learning in which students explore, create, share, and reflect. Design studio culture is joyful, engaged, and collaborative. The design studio is brought to life in each module through a collection of activities that foster this culture of learning and students' evolving computational fluency.</p>\n<p>First, we developed the curriculum materials and designed the online professional learning experience in collaboration with upper elementary school teachers from Title I or rural schools. Then, we piloted the curriculum in collaboration with upper elementary teachers. The pilot teachers maintained field journals about their experiences and participated in interviews, evaluating use of the resources in practice. Finally, we revised and released the curriculum as a free, online resource, in addition to conducting data analysis. This project evaluated teacher learning in the online experience using mixed-methods analyses of pre/post survey data of teachers' perceived expertise and quantitative analyses of teachers' programs and evolving conceptual knowledge. We investigated teacher and student learning in the pilot by drawing on classroom observations, teacher and student interviews, teachers' field journals, and student projects.</p>\n<p><strong>Findings</strong><br />Through collaborative design between researchers and upper elementary teachers, this project developed a model for organizing learning in the classroom: the \"design studio\" model, inspired by architecture and other design professions. This model (which we defined as consisting of exploring, creating, sharing, and reflecting activities) can help teachers and students understand the different aspects of the project creation process. Piloting the curriculum took place during the 2020-2021 school year with 219 students at six schools across the U.S., during the COVID-19 pandemic. All six pilot teachers had participated in the 2020 online learning experience. Each pilot teacher taught three Getting Unstuck projects to the same group of students, starting with the first project in the curriculum (When Clicked) and then choosing two other projects from the remaining nine.</p>\n<p>Pilot teachers shared positive feedback, describing the curriculum materials as comprehensive, flexible, and full of ideas and resources that helped them experiment with new teaching practices. Teachers noticed growth in their students' fluency with Scratch over the course of the projects, noting how students tried new blocks and became invested in their projects. From the pilot, we focused on three areas for revision: supporting learner fluency through selection of model projects; supporting differentiated student pacing in pursuing open-ended projects; and supporting sharing and reflecting through student writing. We completed this final set of revisions and released the materials in summer 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact</strong><br />Getting Unstuck findings demonstrate the feasibility of curriculum that supports the development of fluency with Scratch for both teachers and students. Getting Unstuck demonstrates the impact of supporting design studio culture in the classroom. When teachers and students have opportunities to explore, create, share, and reflect, they are better able to explore their own ideas and interests through creative programming projects. This research also demonstrates the feasibility of flexible and modular curriculum that is designed for teachers to make adaptations for their particular classroom contexts.</p>\n<p>Broadening sustained participation in computing requires opportunities for young learners to express their ideas through computer programming, and as with any medium, the more we use it, the greater our fluency with it becomes. Getting Unstuck offers teachers an effective approach for supporting young learners in bridging the gap between more introductory computing experiences and opportunities to engage in more advanced computer programming educational experiences.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/03/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Karen&nbsp;Brennan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1908110/1908110_10611951_1661794450752_GettingUnstuck--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1908110/1908110_10611951_1661794450752_GettingUnstuck--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Getting Unstuck Website\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1908110/1908110_10611951_1661794450752_GettingUnstuck--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Getting Unstuck Website\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The site for the Getting Unstuck curriculum, available at https://gettingunstuck.gse.harvard.edu</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Creative Computing Lab at Harvard University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Karen&nbsp;Brennan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Getting Unstuck Website</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1908110/1908110_10611951_1661793878987_Creating--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1908110/1908110_10611951_1661793878987_Creating--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Creating in the Design Studio\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1908110/1908110_10611951_1661793878987_Creating--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Creating in the Design Studio\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Page from the Getting Unstuck curriculum orientation; an overview for teachers of what can happen in the classroom as students work on their projects.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Creative Computing Lab at Harvard University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Karen&nbsp;Brennan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Creating in the Design Studio</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1908110/1908110_10611951_1661793988672_RedYellowGreen--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1908110/1908110_10611951_1661793988672_RedYellowGreen--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Red Yellow Green Student Work\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1908110/1908110_10611951_1661793988672_RedYellowGreen--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Red Yellow Green Student Work\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Three students\ufffd feedback on another student\ufffds Scratch project, using the feedback protocol of Red-Yellow-Green.
