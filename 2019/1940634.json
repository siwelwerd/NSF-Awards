 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collaborators on this endeavor will use a telescope called WHAM to complete a long-term project to map the warm gas in the Milky Way Galaxy and nearby \"satellite\" galaxies known as the Magellanic Clouds. The telescope is a rather unusual design and was built specifically for this purpose. WHAM was constructed and has been maintained and operated for 20 years primarily with NSF funding. WHAM has led to Postdoctoral degrees and active careers in science for a large number of young researchers. After a decade at the Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona the telescope is now located in Chile. It is operated remotely (over the internet) and can map the Milky Way in the light produced by different atoms and ions (charged atoms).  Since this warm gas is an important component of the galaxy, astronomers can better understand how the galaxy is changing and can test theories of how it was formed and how it is evolving. Graduate and undergraduate students will continue to be involved in data collection and analysis as part of the operations team.\r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative project from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Space Science Institute in Boulder that seeks to continue operations support for the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM), a remotely controlled facility that is dedicated to the detection and study of faint optical emission lines in the disk and halo of the Milky Way. \u00a0The WHAM facility consists of a 15 cm aperture dual-etalon Fabry-P\u00e9rot spectrometer coupled to a 60 cm aperture siderostat, which together provide a one-degree field-of-view on the sky and produce a 12\u00a0km/s resolution spectrum across a 200 km/s\u00a0spectral window. \u00a0A CCD camera serves as a multichannel detector, recording the spectrum as a Fabry-P\u00e9rot \"ring image\" without scanning. WHAM began operations on Kitt Peak in January 1997 from where it surveyed\u00a0H-alpha emission throughout the entire northern sky (the WHAM-Sky Survey, or WHAM-SS). Complementary observations of various regions in other diagnostic emission lines were also obtained. WHAM has subsequently been refurbished and moved to Cerro Tololo, Chile, achieving first southern light in March 2009. The WHAM-SS has since been completed, and observations in other lines ([SII] and [NII]) have begun. With this award the team will complete mapping in [SII] and [NII], and extend the WHAM (H-alpha) survey to broader velocities. The overarching goal is to complete existing surveys and support current students through to the completion of existing projects. The combined datasets will be used to probe the composition, temperature, heating, and ionization of the Diffuse Ionized Gas (DIG) and Warm Ionized Medium (WIM). The team will investigate the relationship between these components and regions of active star formation. The WHAM facility can also be used to study the earth's atmosphere, comets, zodiacal dust, and lunar sodium.",

Unlike the opaque, dense, molecular gas from which stars form near the galactic plane, the WIM is a diffuse, atomic, ionized gas distributed in a thick layer (about 5,000 to 10,000 light-years from top to bottom) about the Galactic plan. Similar gas is found in most other spiral galaxies as well. Emission from this gas is enhanced in regions where star formation is most active, forming a network of ionized material between the bright emission nebulae in spiral arms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From our vantage point inside the Milky Way, the WIM pervades the whole sky. Like bright emission nebulae, it is most easily studied through radiation emitted by free electrons and protons combining to form a neutral hydrogen atom. One of the brightest of these \"recombination\" lines is Balmer-alpha (H&alpha;), emitted at 656.3 nm, a red \"line\" in the optical part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike nebulae, WIM emission is faint and difficult to detect with traditional instrumentation.</p>\n<p>We built a dedicated instrument extremely sensitive to its large-scale, wide-spread H&alpha; emission. Sacrificing spatial resolution for the ability to record spectra---the distribution of light intensity versus wavelength---the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) has proved to be an exceptional tool. With the ability to detect emission nearly a billion times fainter than the Orion Nebula, WHAM can examine the faintest ionized regions in the local universe and tackle large-scale mapping projects quickly. It was built and tested in Wisconsin and then spent 11 years (1997-2007) on Kitt Peak in Arizona. From there it produced the partial-sky \"WHAM Northern Sky Survey\", revealing details in the WIM that could be compared to other components of the ISM for the first time. In 2008, we refurbished WHAM's hardware and relocated it to Cerro Tololo in Chile to capture emission from parts of the Galaxy only visible from the southern hemisphere. The WHAM Sky Survey (WHAM-SS), an all-sky map blending northern and southern observations, was publicly released in 2016. Researchers can now explore global dynamics of the WIM and local motions within nearby diffuse nebulae, bubbles, and superbubbles.</p>\n<p>As a remotely-controlled facility, WHAM continues to be efficiently operated during most clear, dark-moon nighttime hours. During this renewal (2017-2021) we began exploring emission from other elements in earnest, including nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. Comparing light emitted by other elements to hydrogen, we can start to trace the physical conditions of the gas: its temperature, degree of ionization, and elemental makeup.

Before WHAM, only the neutral hydrogen from these structures could be mapped. During this renewal, we released the first survey of diffuse ionized gas that surrounds the Small Magellanic Cloud.
