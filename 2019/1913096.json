 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on developing reliable and efficient\r\ncomputational methods for solving equations obtained from\r\ndiscretization of elliptic partial differential equations that arise\r\nin engineering and science.  The methods are expected to be of direct\r\nuse in the fast solution of various problems in electrostatics and\r\nmaterials engineering and also to have utility in accelerating\r\ncomputations associated with numerical methods for time dependent\r\nsimulations.  The project will extend a class of highly stable\r\northogonal methods based on sparse banded representations to equations\r\nwith more complicated structures than have been considered before in\r\nthe context of this class of algorithms.  The stability and efficiency\r\nof the methods will be analyzed and an efficient software\r\nimplementation of all the methods will be developed and released.\r\n\r\nThe project involves the development of fast direct algorithms for\r\nelliptic partial differential equations.  The methods are based on\r\nGivens-weight techniques that exploit rank structure in order to limit\r\nfill-in when computing a QR or LQ factorization.  There are four main\r\ncomponents to the project: The extension of orthogonal Givens-weight\r\nalgorithms to strongly admissible rank structures, the development of\r\nefficient block operations acting on blocks that are obtained from\r\ndiscretization of particular subdomains, the analysis of the methods\r\nfor numerical stability and complexity, and the development of an\r\nefficient software library implementing the algorithms.  The\r\noverarching goal is to bridge a gap between the more flexible classes\r\nof methods that have uncertain numerical stability and the highly\r\nstable orthogonal methods that are applicable only to problems with a\r\nrestricted weakly admissible rank structure.  The techniques used are\r\nexpected to lead to algorithms with linear or near-linear complexity,\r\ngood practical efficiency, and provable backward stability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe goal of the project was to provide fast and reliable methods for solving equations that arise often in modeling and simulation in engineering and science. The focus was specifically on problems associated with partial differential equations and integral equations, which can be used in structural engineering, modeling of fluid flow, and in other areas. Commonly used methods are iterative, in that they generate approximate solutions and then refine them. Such methods can be challenging to work with and what works well on one problem might fail to generate acceptable approximations on another. In this project, we investigated a class of direct methods, which directly compute a solution without going through a sequence of successive approximations. Many such solution methods have been proposed in the past and in theory they can avoid some of the difficulties of iterative methods. However there are large challenges to using them in practice, including loss of accuracy due to rounding in computations, difficulty of formulating and implementing them in sufficient generality to really be applied to realistic problems, and computational efficiency of implementations. This project has generated a software library that is computationally efficient, reliable, and more flexible in its applicability than what is common for the class of algorithms considered. The software has been made publicly available for use by other researchers or those needing to solve these types of problems. The approach taken has also provided a mathematical framework for deriving related algorithms and establishing their robustness despite the effects of rounding. The software and theory provide a foundation for future work in this area.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MichaelAStewart\n"
