 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to the American Physical Society (APS) for conference planning and student travel to participate in the joint Canadian, US, and Mexican physical societies' graduate student conference (CAM2019), to be held in Sudbury, Canada, July 24-27, 2019. This is an opportunity for physics graduate students to begin networking across borders. Throughout the conference, students will discuss current research in both formal and informal settings with international peers and professors. \r\n\r\nThe CAM2097 workshop is designed for and by graduate students in all areas of physics. Plenary sessions will be given by well-known scientists in their sub-disciplines including Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Nuclear Physics, Condensed Matter Physics, Biophysics, Optics, Atomic Physics, Nanoscience, Computational Physics, and Materials Physics. The plenary sessions will be followed by contributed talks from the students. There will be two panel discussions on \"International Physics Collaboration\" and \"Communication and Research\" highlighting CAM2019's goal to foster student ability to transcend boundaries in physics. All students who attend will present their research in either a contributed talk or poster session. The organizers will continue a peer feedback program that was introduced at CAM2017 and was well received by the student speakers.  In addition to the traditional scientific program the CAM conference provides, CAM2019 attendees will be able to visit a major international physics facility (SNOLAB).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
