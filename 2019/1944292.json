 "awd_abstract_narration": "The RAPID project responds to the July Ridgecrest earthquakes in Southern California and develops and tests a tool to monitor stress in the Earth and how it changes after large earthquakes. The project takes GPS and satellite radar data and in near real time computes how the Earth's crust and upper mantle are deforming from the mainshocks and aftershock sequences. This project supports two graduate students to work on developing these new tools and testing them in the immediate aftermath of an earthquake. This project could lead to a future real-time aftershock forecasting method.\r\n\r\nThe first major earthquake in southern California in the last 20 years provides an opportunity to test a postseismic stress evolution monitoring system that would operate in near-real time. Coulomb stress changes from the mainshock of an earthquake are routinely computed to examine the potential for triggering earthquakes on nearby faults. It is known that aftershocks within about one fault-length of the rupture can largely be attributed to coseismic stress changes, but at larger distances, stress changes due to deeper postseismic deformation process such as mantle flow are larger than the coseismic stress change. The Ridgecrest earthquake triggered aftershocks greater than 100 km from the mainshock that are not consistent with Coulomb stress changes from the mainshock.The near real time technique developed through this research has potential to be implemented in future real-time aftershock forecasting. An advantage of this approach is that much of the heavy computation required to compute postseismic deformation is pre-computed and stored. The postseismic deformation calculations are relatively inexpensive and suites of models can be easily computed near real time. The Ridgecrest earthquake sequence provides the first opportunity with modern geodetic data to test a stress evolution monitoring system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
