 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop, analyze, and share a database tracking yearly changes in population and migration for approximately 80 individual Arctic Alaska towns and villages, doubling the size of extant databases on this topic. Some of these communities face serious threats from erosion while other communities may see substantial impacts from transportation or resource development in the changing Arctic. All are experiencing complex and rapid socioeconomic changes as Indigenous communities in a globalizing environment. This database will measure population change and net migration, which provides key social indicators for assessing overall effects from many competing forces, and informing plans for the future. Previous work with preliminary versions of this database tested hypotheses about the impacts of the 2008 recession, and consequences of rising erosion in some villages on population dynamics. Newer analyses have compared population trends in northern Alaska with those of two other Inuit Arctic regions, Nunavut Territory in Canada, and Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe organization of this database facilitates integration of community demographics with other types of data such as resource use, environmental observations, and regional or place-based socioeconomic and health indicators. The data collected focus primarily on demographic data, including birth and death rates as well as migration patterns. Applications to date include characterizing demographic aspects of community change; modeling electricity consumption of individual communities; and testing hypotheses about environmental and economic effects on net migration. New analyses planned for the first two years of this project will address (1) inter- and intra-regional comparisons of Arctic community trends; (2) detection and testing for change in response to sudden events, new policies, or economic and environmental forces already in motion; (3) magnitude and impact of continuing gender differences in migration from indigenous communities; and (4) further analysis of differences between communities of Arctic Alaska, Greenland and northern Canada. Reports on project findings, in appropriate formats, will address a range of scientific, Alaska stakeholder, and general public audiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Providing context for these community-level data, a second database integrates data on population, net migration, natural increase, and overall growth rates for each of Alaska's 39 county-equivalent units (boroughs, census areas, municipalities) over 1990-2022. A third data product involves slides forming a \"graphical library\" of individual graphs tracking annual changes in population and net migration for each of the 104 towns and villages. Under creative commons licensing, other users are free to use any of these graphs for their own research, presentations, proposals or other purposes. All three data products have been archived and made publicly accessible through the NSF's Arctic Data Center.</p>\n<p>Analysis of the Arctic Villages database obtained a number of significant results:</p>\n<p>1. We find little evidence for enhanced out-migration from communities threatened by climate-linked erosion. On the contrary, populations of many communities classified as threatened have continued to grow, increasing the number of people at risk--and the need for action.</p>\n<p>2. Broadly speaking, northern Alaska towns and villages exhibit patterns of demographic change different from those of two other Inuit Arctic regions, Nunavut and Greenland:</p>\n<p>- Northern Alaska: high rates of natural increase (births minus deaths) coupled with net out-migration, resulting in uneven but overall slow population growth.</p>\n<p>- Nunavut, Canada: high natural increase coupled with little net migration, resulting in rapid population growth.</p>\n<p>- Greenland: low natural increase coupled with net out-migration, resulting in negative population growth for most municipalities.</p>\n<p>3. There are substantial place-to-place variations in demographic trends, even among neighboring Alaska communities. These variations provide important context for current and future research, as well as public discussions of sustainability, environmental impacts, and change.</p>\n<p>Analyses behind these conclusions, based on earlier versions of the database, have been published in two open-access articles:</p>\n<p>Hamilton, L.C., J.
