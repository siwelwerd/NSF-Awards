CCNY and QSDI aim to establish Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) as a field of interdisciplinary academic rigorous research. In 2018, the first annual conference took place with this aim in mind as well as to foster academic and industry collaborations.  The funding for this conference will be used to support the planning and implementation of the 2019 conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
