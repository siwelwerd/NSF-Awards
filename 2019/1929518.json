 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 21st International Conference on Biochemical and Molecular Engineering (BME XXI) will be held in Mont Tremblant, Quebec. July 14-18, 2019. The theme of the BME XXI conference is Emerging Technologies in Tomorrow's Products and Processes, and it will be organized under the auspices of the Engineering Conferences International (ECI). This international conference will bring together established researchers, young investigators, private sector scientists and engineers as well as graduate students to assess the present and chart the future of the field of biochemical and molecular engineering. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe focus of the conference will be on microbial consortia (microbiome), systems metabolic engineering (systems biology to synthetic evolution), and emerging technologies (optogenetics and epigenetics) in combination with (protein engineering, process development, and scale up. One of the workshops, on Entrepreneurship, will highlight case studies from entrepreneurs around ideas/concepts that drive successful startups and business solutions. Another workshop, on Biochemical Engineering Education, will address important issues relating the industries need for a workforce trained in certain engineering areas, and academia's ever increasing focus on techniques to analyze Big Data/Modeling. The outcome of the meeting will be summarized by a report that will highlight opportunities and new directions in the area of biochemical and molecular engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award is being co-funded by CBET (CBE program) and MCB (CDF and SSB programs).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
