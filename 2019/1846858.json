 "awd_abstract_narration": "Powders and particles are extensively used and processed in industry.  Particulate materials are used in pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, detergents, and consumer products.  Despite their wide use, few engineering and design principles exist to guide the processing of particulates.  Existing models are empirical and specific to certain particle sizes or shapes. Thus, there is a critical need to study particulate systems.  This research will use experiments to  gain insights into the particle-liquid interface and property-processing relationships.  Education and outreach activities will help prepare students to work in this important technological area and increase the participation of women in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nIn this CAREER award, the wetting and granule formation behavior of practical, complex powder formulations will be quantified via static single drop granulation experiments.  The single drop granule formation information will be used to scale-up to industrial granulators.  Linking the material properties (micro-scale) to the process parameters (meso- and macro-scale) and product granule structure (meso-scale) will provide a scientific means, via semi-empirical models and regime maps, to design and predict granules of tailored properties.  Here, new knowledge will be created with the potential to predict granular product properties based on the characterization of the powder-liquid interface, along with the raw feed material and process parameters.  This work aims to transform the granulation process, allowing granulation to be more broadly applied and expanded to new industries, such as biomass and metal-organic frameworks.  Two novel scientific broader impacts of this work include: (1) the ability to predict granulation routes, and (2) the application of granulation to a variety of new industries.  Through this award, students from middle school through graduate school will be engaged and supported in chemical engineering, and specifically particle technology research, to inform and prepare students for career opportunities in this field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
