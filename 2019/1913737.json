The title is: \"The Brain Produces Mind by Modeling\". Speakers include a large variety of world leaders in computational and behavioral modeling of the brain-mind connection. The colloquium will bring together various threads and approaches in neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychological science by focusing on computational modeling that attempts to bridge the gaps between these fields. It aims to present a coherent view of the brain as a model builder, using the model to maximize survival and utility in a complex world.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
