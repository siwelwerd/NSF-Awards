 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, graduate students from US universities obtain international research experience in social and hydrological sciences while working on a scientific problem with real-world implications. Changes in climate cause communities to adapt to enhance resiliency and foster practices that are more appropriate for new conditions. In regions where dry seasons are increasingly long, the shorter rainy seasons experience more severe storms. Rural and agricultural communities are especially vulnerable to new seasonal conditions and their resources for adaptation are limited. The Dry Corridor of Central America (spanning parts of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) is an important region for agriculture and needs adaptation strategies. The project location is ideal because of its many-decades history of changing climate. Regions of the western United States are also becoming more arid and experience more extreme rainfall events. Effective adaptation and resiliency strategies incorporate combinations of technological and societal changes. The collaborative model in this study consists of experts in hydrology and watershed studies, ethnography and participatory research, agriculture, and community outreach. Researchers and professionals from Michigan Technological University, the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI), and Lutheran World Relief (LWR), a US-based international relief organization that is starting a multiyear project to strengthen communities for disaster mitigation, provide needed expertise to achieve project objectives. The project team and student participants are incorporating hydrometeorological data into forecasting tools to provide data-driven recommendations for rural agricultural communities so they are more resilient to water scarcity and flooding. Students learn new collaborative research methods in an international context to enhance their capabilities for working in socially and culturally diverse settings to address complex problems in land-use management in a changing climate and challenging landscapes.\r\n\r\nStudents work with mentors/experts in social and hydrological sciences research and education in agricultural communities in the Dry Corridor of El Salvador. The project participants work with local farmers and agricultural stakeholders to gain experience in adapting to climate change. The interdisciplinary scientists and development professionals work together in participatory research in communities experiencing water scarcity and extreme rainfall events. Students collect hydrometeorological and community data to use in computational tools to understand and forecast the hydrological system in steep-sloped, semi-arid area subject to changing land-use. The increased hydrological understanding along with participatory, community-based research better informs decision-makers about more appropriate agricultural and water management practices in response to observed changes in the regional climate. The research team measures the effectiveness of these strategies on crop yields, water usage, and impacts of precipitation-related hazards. The research aims to inform farmers and other local stakeholders about hydrological factors that influence crop yields in areas with highly variable weather and climate. The research will influence decisions regarding crop selection, planting practices, and irrigation. Each year a new diverse cohort of ten US graduate students with different, but complementary, disciplinary backgrounds work together on issues related to these hazards. The students participate in an 8-week international educational and research experience, working with experts in hydrological modeling, participatory research, agriculture, and hydrological and meteorological monitoring. Professional development activities for the student participants further the broader impacts of this work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The three cohorts of students had not conducted research abroad before. Climate change often requires communities to adapt to enhance their resiliency and foster practices that are more appropriate for new conditions. In regions where dry seasons are increasingly long and more severe, the shorter rainy seasons lead to fewer but more severe storms, which can result in flash flooding. Rural and agricultural communities are especially vulnerable to new seasonal conditions and resources for adaptation are more limited. Varied rainfall patterns are particularly challenging to rural farmers&rsquo; agricultural calendars and traditional practices where entire crops can be lost during unpredictable midsummer droughts or extreme rainfall events. The Dry Corridor of Central America (spanning parts of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) is an important region for agriculture, and long-term climate changes are spawning new adaptation strategies for dealing with changing drought conditions. Natural disasters, loss of agricultural livelihoods, and food insecurity are impacted by climate and are some of the root causes of migration from this region. Effective adaptation and resiliency strategies incorporate combinations of technological and societal changes. The collaborative model in this study consisted of experts in hydrology and watershed studies, ethnography, agriculture, and community outreach. Researchers and professionals from Michigan Technological University, the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc., and Lutheran World Relief, a US-based international relief organization, collaborated in this multiyear project to conduct research on how communities effectively adapt to longer and more severe dry seasons and shorter rainy seasons that experience more extreme rainfall events. The project team and student participants collected and incorporated hydrometeorological and hydrological data, adapted water-assessment models to analyze flash-flood hazards and characterized issues affecting water access and water usage in small, rural communities. The students lived and worked in the communities and learned how to conduct ethnographic research to better understand the societal, economic, and policy impacts on water access. Students learned new collaborative research methods in an international context to enhance their capabilities for working in socially and culturally diverse settings to address complex problems in a changing climate and challenging landscapes. The project participants worked with local farmers and agricultural stakeholders to gain experience in how residents adapt to climate change for growing crops on small scales. The research team learned that issues affecting water access in rural communities are a complex combination of social, political, and land-title conditions. Our work demonstrated that projects by nongovernmental organizations are more sustainable where efforts are also focused on growing effective community leadership groups through training opportunities and continued active engagement. The international research experience was impactful for each of the students, especially in fostering more confidence in being able to effectively work in a different sociocultural setting. For some, the experiences were transformational. Some students changed their research projects afterward to base their graduate work on the experience. Some students used the research experience to later apply for funding and fellowships related to their work in El Salvador. For others, it inspired them to pursue doctoral studies and to conduct their research in El Salvador. The international partners benefited from the research results in helping to understand the most sustainable and impactful approaches for their project work in these communities. Collaborations formed throughout the project formed new connections that led to new risk reduction projects.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/11/2025<br>\nModified by: John&nbsp;S&nbsp;Gierke</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1855690/1855690_10604184_1736605726896_Students_at_Tank--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1855690/1855690_10604184_1736605726896_Students_at_Tank--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"IRES and UES students touring educational farm facility.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1855690/1855690_10604184_1736605726896_Students_at_Tank--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"IRES and UES students touring educational farm facility.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">IRES students visited the experimental farm operated by the University of El Salvador and learned about agricultural projects conducted by the UES students and shared in the hydrological work that was carried out in this project.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">B.A. Bartel</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;S&nbsp;Gierke\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">IRES and UES students touring educational farm facility.</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1855690/1855690_10604184_1736606261194_Students_installingArable--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1855690/1855690_10604184_1736606261194_Students_installingArable--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"El Salvador IRES participants installing weather station\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1855690/1855690_10604184_1736606261194_Students_installingArable--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"El Salvador IRES participants installing weather station\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Meteorological data was collected using weather stations installed at fincas among the communities for this work.
