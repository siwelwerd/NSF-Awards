 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator plans to improve systems that rely on brain-computer interfaces that are used in virtual and augmented reality environments. These improvements will enhance comfort and reliability when used by individuals with disorders within the autism spectrum. The benefits of these improvements will advance the effectiveness of treatments for emotion regulation and behavioral interventions.  There is a growing interest in complementing such behavioral clinical treatments with various low-cost and easy-to-access technology-based tools to improve therapy efficacy. However, it was shown that training through existing technology-based Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) intervention tools does not usually generalize to real-life activities for many reasons. The investigator will develop an intervention for ASD to reinforce emotion regulation strategies based on real-time monitoring and analysis. Specifically, the planned electroencephalography (EEG)-guided brain-computer interface (BCI) technology could be used to complement all clinical treatments that focus on emotion regulation to decrease clinician time spent with each patient. The novel scientific discoveries and engineering enhancements will have overreaching contributions to develop ASD intervention techniques for (i) decreased depression and anxiety; (ii) decreased problematic behaviors including aggression in social interactions; and (iii) decreased functional impairment across different settings including school, work, home and community. Research and education goals will include: (i) course development; (ii) inclusion of researchers from K-12 to graduate level in cutting-edge interdisciplinary research environment to promote STEM careers; and (iii) establishing new outreach activities to inform the broader public about the proposed research outcomes and the latest technological advancements in research for technology-based ASD intervention.  \r\n\r\nThe research objective of this specific project is to introduce a framework that will enable EEG-guided closed-loop: (i) monitoring of the brain responses of individuals during technology-based ASD intervention, and (ii) control of the presentation of clinical treatment strategy cues for emotion regulation in individuals with ASD. In particular, for such human-computer interfaces: (1) the proposition of monitoring brain responses through EEG during ASD intervention is novel, and (2) formulating  design  principles  for  model-based  optimal  EEG-guided  closed-loop  clinical  treatment strategy cue presentation is transformative.  These propositions of real-time probabilistic analysis of EEG are unique, and present a potentially game-changing opportunity to advance the generalization effect of existing technology-based ASD intervention for emotion regulation.  This project will also contribute to developing new machine learning algorithms and neuroscience methods to identify EEG features associated with emotion regulation to classify between distress and non-distress conditions, and to distinguish among different distress levels.  The developed models will be based on a solid mathematical framework based on variational autoencoders and Bayesian optimal statistical inference, information theoretic measures of feature selection for efficient learning, and computationally efficient optimization of modular and submodular monotonic or non-monotonic functions.  Optimization algorithms will provide computationally efficient solutions that generate(sub)optimal feature selection strategies with performance guarantees.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Every summer a high-school student was hosted in the PI&rsquo;s laboratory (a total of 6 high-school students) to perform research in this specific project. &nbsp;The research resulted in a total of 8 refereed journal articles. &nbsp;We recruited 74 autistic individuals (University of Pittsburgh IRB #STUDY17070496) to be enrolled in a 12-week clinical treatment program, and they were randomized between EASE and a control treatment (EASE and Control Groups). Participants were recruited to attend EEG data collection sessions at the beginning and end of the clinical treatment program using an EEG-based BCI. We denote these sessions as visit 1 (pre-visit) and visit 2 (post-visit).&nbsp; 71 individuals agreed to participate in visit 1, only 43 individuals agreed to attend visit 2. In both visits, the participants completed a 10-step protocol: &nbsp;(1) Game 1 without EEG collection to learn the response speed; (2) Game 2 without EEG collection to introduce the Affective Posner task to the players; (3) Rest State EEG collection;&nbsp; (4) EEG collection during Game 3; (5) Rest State EEG Collection (6) EEG collection during short mindfulness EASE treatment exercises guided through auditory instructions; (7) Rest State EEG Collection; (8) Repetition of Game 3; (9) Rest State EEG collection; (10) Repetition of Game 2. Card games are based on the Affective Posner Task with deception (Figure 2). Using the EEG data collected from 21 participants of Visit 1, we investigated the EEG features that could differentiate between distress (WIN) and non-distress (LOSE) conditions of the games. Results showed that the WIN and LOSE conditions could be distinguished with average accuracy of 81%, LOSE and rest-EEG conditions with average accuracy 94.8%, and WIN and rest-EEG conditions with average accuracy 94.9%. Most informative EEG features and their contributions to the decisions were identified (Figure 3). &nbsp;Analysis of Visit 1 rest state EEG data (35 participants) showed significant differences between before (Pre-MF) and after (Post-MF) short mindfulness exercises. Frontal and temporal EEG channels were most informative: total powers in the beta band (16-30 Hz), and relative power in alpha band (8-12 Hz) (Figure 4). A classifier using the selected EEG features from selected channel locations separated Pre-MF and Post-MF resting states with an average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 80.76%, 78.24%, and 82.14% respectively. We also investigated the pre-visit and post-visit EEG data to distinguish between the EASE and Control groups and explored the impacts of mindfulness practice. &nbsp;Using random forest classifiers over the post-visit EEG features baseline corrected by pre-visit, the study achieved 88.48% to 91.86% accuracy in distinguishing EASE and Control groups under distress, non-distress, and neutral conditions. A 2-way ANOVA explored the impact of group (EASE vs Control) and visit (pre-Visit vs post-Visit) information on the EEG features as identified through the classifier, revealing significant interactions in theta and alpha band power at prefrontal regions. The EASE group showed increased theta and alpha band power from pre-visit to post-visit, indicating heightened relaxation, while the Control group experienced decreased activity (Figure 5). These findings underscore mindfulness' positive influence on emotion regulation potentially showing its effects as neural oscillations matching the results from existing literature. Subgroup analysis based on Clinical Global Impressions threshold scores identified responders and non-responders, with T-tests confirming greater EEG feature changes in EASE subgroups compared to controls. Our findings provide insights into potential benefits of mindfulness-based interventions for autistic people, highlighting the neurophysiological effects and integration of EEG-based BCI in the clinical interventions in the future to monitor distress during simulated scenarios in virtual or augmented reality environments.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/23/2025<br>\nModified by: Murat&nbsp;Akcakaya</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1844885/1844885_10593152_1745429231589_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1844885/1844885_10593152_1745429231589_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1844885/1844885_10593152_1745429231589_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A) Game paradigms where T refers to a complete trial, (B) the proposed complete task-trial based on the Affective Posner with deception.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Figure 2</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Murat&nbsp;Akcakaya\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1844885/1844885_10593152_1745428890504_Figure1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1844885/1844885_10593152_1745428890504_Figure1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1844885/1844885_10593152_1745428890504_Figure1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Overview of the envisioned EEG-based BCI.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Figure 1</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Murat&nbsp;Akcakaya\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1844885/1844885_10593152_1745429139363_Figure5--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1844885/1844885_10593152_1745429139363_Figure5--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Figure 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1844885/1844885_10593152_1745429139363_Figure5--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Figure 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mean plots of theta band power at pre-frontal regions, alpha band power at pre-frontal regions, and relative beta band power at temporal brain regions for each feedback condition across all participants.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Figure 5</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Murat&nbsp;Akcakaya\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 5</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1844885/1844885_10593152_1745429169018_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1844885/1844885_10593152_1745429169018_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1844885/1844885_10593152_1745429169018_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A) The percentage of relative occurrence of the spectral features across participants in the classification of Pre-MF and Post-MF.
