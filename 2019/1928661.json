 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decision-making in healthcare requires rapid synthesis of information from multiple sources, and failure can lead to patient harm. Expert, high-performing nurses can quickly grasp complex situations and perform the skills required for effective patient care. New nurses, however, often lack experience and the expertise that comes with it, hindering their ability to take immediate proper action. Currently, no technological aids exist to support decision nursing decision-making. This award will develop a model of expert nurse responses in ambulatory (outpatient) care and use this model to develop real-time support. With an aging population and care moving to home environments, decision-support technology can have an impact on the health across populations. The technology can also elevate the quality of care in underserved regions and improve training.  In addition, this work will advance undergraduate curriculum with new models linking technology with decision-making and improve K-12 education through new project modules that introduce the impact of technology on health. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to augment performance of ambulatory care nurses by integrating physiological sensing of behavior and cognitive function with models of expert behaviors. First, the project will develop models for expert nurse decision-making and actions. The fundamental processes of nursing expertise at the individual and system levels will be modeled with a mixed method approach that includes ethnography and eye-tracking measurements. Second, the project will use physiological sensors (eye tracking and EEG) to monitor nurse capability and behavior. The sensor data and models that use them will be used to identify appropriate times for coaching interventions that will provide decision support to nurses in real-time through augmented reality. The entire system will be evaluated in a controlled setting at the Center for Nursing Education and Simulation with nursing trainees.  The goal of this planning project is to develop the necessary infrastructure, and foundational work to expand the opportunities for studying future technology, workers, and work at the level of a full Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier research proposal.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
