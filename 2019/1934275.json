 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop features senior scholars of color sharing their expertise on recruiting and retaining faculty of color at the department level, the college level, and the institutional level.  The workshop has three tangible outcomes: 1) To educate search committees on the best practices of recruiting and retaining faculty of color. 2) To educate college leaders on why faculty of color leave, and how to create campuses that welcome faculty of color, and 3) To identify specific institutional changes college leaders may make to ensure the faculty body reflects the student body.  The workshop will be of interest to department chairs, search committee chairs, and campus trustees.  In order to maximize attendance, the workshop is being held at the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
