 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chytrids are a poorly studied group of aquatic fungi that ubiquitously inhabit bogs, ponds, and oceans. These fungi are fundamental to the cycling of nutrients, such as through the degradation of pollen, keratin, or through parasitism of organisms such as algae or frogs. Most of what is known about the diversity of chytrids is based on microscopic observations over the last century or from pure cultures established in the last few decades. However, diversity based assessments using the more recently developed DNA-based environmental approaches challenge whether we truly know chytrid diversity, because the species documented in this way typically fail to match species identified using traditional approaches. This project will implement multiple approaches to provide a holistic picture of chytrid diversity and classification that avoids biases of any particular method. Understanding taxonomy of this poorly known group and other fungi is vital for cataloging biodiversity and predicting its environmental impacts. This project will support one Postdoctoral Fellow, a graduate student, and will provide training to undergraduates. Web-based content on the chytrid biology, classification, and will be developed in order to disseminate information to a broader audience. A week-long, hands on workshop on chytrid methods will be held at the University of Michigan Biological Station in order to encourage continued research on this understudied group.  \r\n\r\nThis project leverages an existing and growing historical collection of chytrid cultures and recently developed methods to sequence DNA from single cells. The proposed research includes generating or completing at least 840 ribosomal RNA sequences and 20 genome sequences of chytrids in the Collection of Zoosporic Eufungi at the University of Michigan (CZEUM). It will also employ a single cell approach to phylogenetically characterize uncultured diversity. Specifically, chytrid fungi will be identified in situ in from field sites, photographed, and single cells subjected to genome amplification. From the successfully amplified genomes, 100 diverse samples will be targeted for whole ribosomal RNA operon sequencing using long-read, single molecule DNA sequencing. An additional 20 samples will be used for genome sequencing. A major outcome will be a phylogenetic analysis of the chytrids combining both ribosomal RNA and genome sequencing into a supertree. A final aim of the project is to screen and sequence novel diversity of fungal viruses from the CZEUM collection and to determine the effect of ecology and morphology on viral prevalence. This project will serve as a model for addressing systematics in eukaryotic lineages where culture-based approaches produce an incomplete picture of diversity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In other cases, species long known to exist have not been added to the fungal tree of life, because they are only known from species descriptions and have not been cultivated. This project investigated the biodiversity of the fungal group Chytridiomycota using a variety of innovative molecular approaches to tackle both cultivated and uncultivated fungi. These approaches serve as benchmarks for research in other fungal groups. The Chytridiomycota (chytrids) are a group of fungi that are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems and serve a number of important ecosystem functions. Most of our knowledge is based on either microscopic observations of uncultivated taxa or cultured taxa from baiting aquatic samples with substrates favored by chytrids. Our primary approaches were to use single cell DNA sequencing (both whole genomes and the ribosomal RNA barcoding marker) to find novel chytrids in aquatic habitats, photograph them, and to place them into the fungal tree of life. We also used whole genome sequencing of cultures and nearly whole operon ribosomal RNA sequencing to catalog our fungal collection and investigate the biology of these organisms. A number of outcomes emerged as intellectual merit from this investigation. A primary outcome was the revision of the phylogeny of the zoosporic fungi and the revision of our understanding of the basic life cycle of the early fungi. Instead of being comprised of organisms with a haploid-dominate life cycle, we found the chytrids were primarily diploid-dominant for most of their life cycle. A second major outcome was a study that documented 127 uncultured cells by microscopy and placed them in the fungal tree of life using ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Most of these cells have now been used for complete genome sequencing and will greatly expand our knowledge of the function and phylogeny of chytrid and other zoosporic (fungi with swimming spores) fungi. This project also facilitated the sequencing of the Collection of Zoosporic Eufungi at the University of Michigan (CZEUM) to develop molecular barcodes for better identification of cultures. Four new genera of fungi were described in Cladochytriales and one new genus in the Rhizophydiales. The project also screened the CZEUM collection for viruses and found that many of the chytrids were host to fungal viruses which are currently being investigated for their impacts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader impacts include the continued development of the CZEUM collection, which has grown to over 1350 strains available for use by the community. We held a workshop at the University of Michigan Biological Station in 2022 that trained over 15 researchers on techniques to work with the group. The workshop was led by a global team of chytrid experts. Videos documenting the methods used to study chytrids have been posted to YouTube.
