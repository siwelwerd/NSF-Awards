 "awd_abstract_narration": "Energy consumption is a critical factor in the economy and national security. Global energy is largely obtained from burning nonrenewable fossil fuels that release carbon dioxide (CO2) as the primary waste product. Successfully recycling CO2 emissions back into energy-rich chemical compounds could produce commodity chemicals and renewable fuels economically while reducing waste. However, CO2 is hard to react and requires additional complexes (catalysts) to assist in the conversion to other molecules. Despite considerable progress, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the principles that connect catalyst structure with catalyst performance. In this project, Dr. Jurss is developing new catalysts to understand how to develop more efficient CO2 catalysts. Dr. Jurss is actively engaged in recruiting and mentoring underrepresented undergraduates and Mississippi high school students through hands-on research programs.  These programs promote careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Dr. Jurss  and his students contribute to a series of engaging newspaper articles in Lafayette County, MS to increase public awareness and scientific literacy through the lens of renewable energy. \r\n\r\nWith funding from both the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) of NSF, Dr. Jurss (University of Mississippi) develops molecular catalysts based on two strategies involving highly tunable redox-active ligands and well-defined bimetallic catalysts, by which multiple redox equivalents can be accumulated at modest potentials to facilitate the efficient multielectron reduction of CO2. These complementary strategies center on understanding how geometric and electronic structure dictate activity, selectivity, and mechanism. In order to control catalyst structure, multidentate ligand frameworks with limited flexibility are developed to achieve more reactive geometries or explicit interactions between multiple metal active sites. Dr. Jurss is analyzing these systems with electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques, including UV-visible and infrared spectroelectrochemistry, to establish structure-activity relationships, to elucidate reaction mechanisms, and to validate design principles for catalyst development. In parallel, Dr. Jurss is providing research opportunities in his laboratory that aim to increase the involvement of underrepresented students in STEM disciplines. These summer research experiences, along with a public outreach activity in which Dr. Jurss is writing newspaper articles on emerging energy technologies for The Oxford Eagle, support the broader impacts of the project and highlight the role of scientists in addressing global energy challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
