 "awd_abstract_narration": "ACIDS (Advanced Computing Infrastructure Driving Long-tail Sciences), supports and enables multidisciplinary research in LTS (Long Tail Science) projects that are not traditionally supported by large scale computing centers. The system whose acquisition is enabled by this award is expected to act as a catalyst for the regional advancement of LTS. The projects combine large collaborations and research programs requiring advanced computing infrastructure to work with the data and perform the latest analyses and simulations. The instrument supports the increase of knowledge in multiple domains since these machine learning methods are data hungry and computationally expensive.\r\n\r\nThe instrumentation advances scientific inquiries to improved antiviral developments, effective public policy decisions, efficient pathological review, and large-scale neuro-imaging data mining. The application of deep learning techniques, structural biology, neuroscience, public health evaluation, language translation, anomaly detection, etc., constitutes a common theme running through these projects. All participating faculty, staff, postdocs, and students across multiple centers and colleges will have access to ACIDS through collaborations and partnerships. Thus, training, outreach, and education will be supported in multiple application areas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
