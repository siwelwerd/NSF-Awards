 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras, California State University Stanislaus, University of the District of Columbia and Northern Michigan University will address the dearth of Ancestral Computing for Sustainability in computer science education. The primary goal of this project is to research the incorporation of ancestral knowledge systems and computer science education as disciplines that co-create positive learning ecologies for marginalized communities, especially women of color, towards sustainable computing. This project aligns with the and can fill a void in the current broadening participation body of work.\r\n\r\nDespite aggressive broadening participation efforts from a wide range of initiatives, those focused on women of color continues to lag.  There is a need for women of color to see themselves as intellectual contributors to society within the curricula. Expanding on  culturally responsive curriculum and ethnomathematics, this project intends to research students' multiple identities as these relate to ancestral knowledge systems and sustainable computing. This is done to create computer science education curricula that ensures women of color lived world experiences are endogenous. In addition, Ancestral Computing for Sustainability has the vision to create new epistemologies and axiologies to reconfigure the bodies of knowledge that are mediated by computer science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over the course of three and a half years the project, titled Ancestral Computing for Sustainability (ACS), brought together scholars to explore the possibilities of opening intellectual interdisciplinary conversations; a purposeful weaving together of computer science education, ethnic studies, and Indigenous studies. This exploration centered ancestral knowledge as thee core framework binding the three disciplines together. This investigation considered the ways ancestral knowledge may have the potential to expand possibilities for creating encouraging learning environments for marginalized communities, especially women of color, in fields where computing is central. In practice, the research team created an academic bond reimaging what it means to be a network of BIPOC scholars navigating academia and giving life to a meaningful and distinct professional connection. In light of the COVID-19 Global Pandemic, this academic bond proved both nurturing and steadying in uncertain times for the participating faculty and scholars. Two significant activities of the team were the engagements with female students of color from each campus through an anonymous survey as well as a series of contemplative focus group sessions. Through these engagements; researchers gleaned valuable insights and have accomplished the following:&nbsp;presented preliminary findings at multiple conference presentations, published a journal article, and secured a book chapter in a forthcoming text. A long- term goal includes the production of a book that will highlight the multi-faceted conversations as well as expand on varying conversations associated with computer science education that will range from the wellness of the student of color enrolled in such a field to the responsibilities of sustainability and the wellness of the earth.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/27/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeffery&nbsp;Fleming</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1938211/1938211_10638919_1674857032546_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1938211/1938211_10638919_1674857032546_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ancestral Computing for Sustainability Logo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1938211/1938211_10638919_1674857032546_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ancestral Computing for Sustainability Logo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Burgundy and gold image depicting the intersection of rooted ancestral  Earth wisdom and modern , computer-based technology.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">The ACS logo</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michelle&nbsp;C&nbsp;Chatman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ancestral Computing for Sustainability Logo</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1938211/1938211_10638919_1674860740259_AncestralComputingforSustainability(ACS)study(3)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1938211/1938211_10638919_1674860740259_AncestralComputingforSustainability(ACS)study(3)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ancestral Computing for Sustainability UDC Recruitment Flier\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1938211/1938211_10638919_1674860740259_AncestralComputingforSustainability(ACS)study(3)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ancestral Computing for Sustainability UDC Recruitment Flier\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">ACS Recruitment flier for University of the District (HBCU).
