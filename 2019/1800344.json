 "awd_abstract_narration": "M. Scott Shell of the University of California Santa Barbara is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models, and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division to develop broad-based algorithms for systematic coarse-graining.  Computer simulations of the molecular world are an established and invaluable tool for understanding how the concert of atomic motions and interactions gives rise to observed properties in biology, materials, fluid mixtures, etc.  Simulations may also suggest novel experimental directions for the design of new synthetic molecules.  It is very computationally expensive to model every single atom  in a molecule over even the shortest times (millionths of a second).  This expense puts severe limits on the complexity of simulations that can be pursued.  Dr. Shell and coworkers have developed an approach by which unnecessary atomic detail in simulations can be automatically identified.  These unnecessary details are replaced by 'coarse-grained' models that require far fewer calculations. In turn, these coarse models permit simulations on dramatically larger scales.   This capability opens new problems and systems of study.  This project develops this basic approach by creating powerful ways to maintain high accuracy in highly coarse models and applies the new technique to understand peptide-based materials.  This project provides educational opportunities for students at multiple levels, including involvement of those from underrepresented groups. Professor Shell mentors undergraduate researchers and participates in several campus-wide diversity initiatives that contribute to the professional development and research training programs at UCSB's\r\nCalifornia Nanosystems Institute. The team develops strategies to improve the recruitment of women students in theoretical and computational research. A yearly seminar coordinated by Dr. Shell brings distinguished female researchers to campus to serve as role models for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs.  \r\n\r\nWhile coarse-graining methods have been vigorously pursued in recent years, major practical and conceptual barriers remain that compromise coarse-grained (CG) model accuracy, transferability, and automation, and thus limit the general reliability of these all-important modeling approaches.  This project leverages the relative entropy framework developed by the Shell group to create general new strategies for addressing these limitations.  These new methods are rooted in rigorous statistical mechanical theory and state-of-the-art molecular simulation techniques.  Specifically, the project creates robust strategies for efficiently and accurately modeling complex, multibody CG interactions across state conditions, chemistries, and systems, and for seamlessly including external constraints (like experimental information) in the bottom-up CG strategy.  As an application of the techniques, this work develops a next-generation, general but sequence-sensitive CG peptide model suitable for understanding and predicting supramolecular self-assembly in emerging hybrid polymer-peptide materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project has developed new strategies for predictive, multiscale modeling of complex molecular systems. A longstanding goal in the modeling community has been the capability to simulate, from atomistic-scale interactions alone, the properties and behaviors of systems at much larger scales, spanning biology to synthetic materials. However, current atomistic simulation methods while predictive are starkly limited to the simplest of systems, at short length and time scales, even with advances in computational hardware (e.g., GPU computing). The core feature of this projects approach has been a new theoretical framework based on the concept of relative entropy minimization  essentially a quantitative and universal way to optimally design coarser representations of complex systems that retain essential physics and make accurate predictions about larger scale behaviors. Such coarse-grained models open many new avenues to simulate systems in a predictive manner at orders of magnitude larger scales, thus enabling computational insights into mechanistic processes and design of materials not previously possible.\r\n\n\nIntellectual merit. We have made several advances in the development of relative entropy coarse-graining theory and the practical implementation and application of algorithms based on it. (1) We developed new ways to make coarse-grained models more expressive and hence capable of accurately representing effective interactions at large scales, specifically using local-density potentials. (2) We have developed strategies to simulate coarse-grained models of peptide self-assembly at large scale, which we have used to characterize their aggregation in mechanistic models of neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimers disease. (3) In collaborations with groups at Penn State and University of Trento, we extended the relative entropy framework to establish a theory for designing the resolution of coarse-grained models (e.g., the degree of coarsening), and to understand levels of resolution that are naturally emergent and should be targeted for modeling. (4) We advanced new versions of relative entropy theory and algorithms to enable coarse-grained models that are highly transferable, for example, able to construct predictive simulation models applicable over wide ranges of composition, temperature, or sequence space. (5) Finally, we have collaborated with another group at UCSB to use relative entropy coarse-graining to parameterize polymer field theoretic models that can be simulated at even larger scales. This is particularly impactful because it empowers the field theory with predictive capabilities starting from atomic-scale interactions, and ultimately enables rapid screening of systems not easily amenable to particle-based modeling, such as surfactants, high molecular weight polymers, and other complex solution formulations.\r\n\n\nBroader impacts. Multiscale techniques are pivotal to the next generation of modeling efforts, particularly for systems that have little characterization and thus are not amenable to data mining and AI. This significance and impact of this work is a versatile approach to multiscale modeling that provides a systematic route to studying complex systems, based on fundamental molecular-scale interactions and chemistries. Our work has been widely reported to the simulation community through presentations and publications and many of its members have now used these ideas to advance their own modeling work. A version of our coarse-graining algorithm has also been incorporated in an open software package. On the educational front, the Shell group has mentored six graduate and four undergraduate students on this project. The group has also founded a campus-wide seminar series for graduate students in the areas of modern simulation methods that received support from this grant. In particular, the grant supported an annual invited seminar speaker as a part of that series. PI Shell has also been active in outreach and other educational activities at UCSB, regularly delivering workshops on science communication and participating in student-faculty mixers.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/14/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: M ScottShell\n"
