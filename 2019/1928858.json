 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Diversity Workshop and Mentoring Program will be held July 28-31, 2019 at the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) at the Colorado Convention Center. The program brings historically-underrepresented undergraduates, graduates, post-docs, and early career professionals together with more senior statisticians in academia, government, and the private sector for mentoring, networking, and leadership and skills development. The ultimate objective of this workshop is to foster enduring mentoring relationships and prepare statisticians and data scientists of diverse backgrounds for career success.\r\n\r\nThe program will include information sessions, small group discussions and one-on-one meetings of mentor/mentee pairs during the conference. The overarching theme for the sessions is Developing Leaders, Growing Community, and Ensuring a Diverse Profession. Participants will have an opportunity to participate in parallel sessions on topics such as Career Success: Tips and Traps, Graduate School Success, Effective Presentation Skills, Strategic Networking, and Developing Successful Mentoring Relationships. The program will conclude with a Keynote address and a 100th Birthday Celebration of David Blackwell. The program is organized by the American Statistical Association's Committee on Minorities in Statistics with additional support provided by a workshop planning committee. The workshop website is https://community.amstat.org/cmis/events/dwmp/dwmp2019\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
