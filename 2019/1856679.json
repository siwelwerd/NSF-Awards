 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses a fundamental question in the study of life: can we predict the evolutionary success of animals based on their forms? Crabs are one of the most iconic groups of invertebrates, playing an integral role in aquarium trade, fisheries, and aquaculture, and are celebrated in cultures around the world through festivals and parades. This research aims to build the tree of life for all known living and fossil crab families, to investigate how these animals have changed over 200 million years of history. The typical body form that characterizes crabs has evolved separately several times from lobster-like ancestors, and also has been lost several times in different groups of crabs. The new crab tree of life will reveal whether the independent gains and losses of the crab shape predict the immense biodiversity and ecological versatility of the group. The inspiring diversity of crab form and function will engage high school students through museum activities, and undergraduate students in primary research and classroom modules incentivizing critical thinking. Fieldwork will be conducted in Panama, where a training course in tropical crab taxonomy will immerse US and Latin American scientists in the techniques used to expand and investigate the crab tree of life.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of a crab-like body form has evolved four to five times among decapod crustaceans, and has been proposed as a contributing factor to the immense diversification and ecological success within the infraorders Brachyura (>7000 species of true crabs), and Anomura (>2500 species including porcelain crabs, hermit crabs, and king crabs). The objectives of this project are: (1) To construct a well-supported backbone phylogeny for false and true crabs using genomic (extant) and morphological (extant and fossil) data. (2) To employ fossils as age calibrations to construct an evolutionary timeline; this will serve as the foundation for inferring the pattern and geological timing of crab body plan evolution. (3) To test if the rate of diversification has increased in crab-like lineages relative to their sister groups, and likewise has decreased when the crab-like body was secondarily lost. The researchers hypothesize that at least some traits comprise a possible key innovation. These objectives will be achieved by sequencing 500 crab species using target enrichment methods, morphological coding and imaging of living and fossil taxa (including representatives of all crab families), and the deployment of cutting-edge strategies for divergence time analysis and phylogenetic comparative methods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our results have implicated carcinization as the main axis of quantitative morphological variation, and suggests integration (correlated evolution) of the carapace and pleon that may facilitate extreme disparity in crabs. Our work also suggests that the adaptive advantage of carcinization is unclear, which is unusual for the paradigm of convergence that is seen as organisms repeatedly evolving the same solution to an environmental problem. To generalize a predictive framework for the \"rules of life\", it is critical to consider systems like carcinization, where convergence may not be driven by particular ecological factors.\n\n\nOur phylogenetic research spun off to address terrestrialization. Most arthropods that made the journey from water to land only did so once (insects, myriapods) or possibly a few times (arachnids), with most such events occurring more than 300 million years ago. With the abundance of groups like insects, it may seem that most terrestrial niches were already occupied, preventing new groups from joining the land. Yet, we show that over the last 100 million years, true crabs have independently populated land and freshwater at least 17 times (including a newly described extinct taxon, Cretapsara), and have fully returned to the ocean at least twice. Most of these 17 crab groups are only able to survive in semi-terrestrial habitats (e.g. intertidal zones, lagoons, and estuaries). These results suggest that crabs provide an important window into early processes of adaptation to new environments, and different degrees of evolutionary constraint that may help predict these pathways.\n\n\nFurthermore, we have described five new fossil species, redescribed known fossil taxa using advanced 3D imaging techniques, and implemented new strategies for phylogenetic analysis of fossils and divergence time inference. We described exceptional preservation of eye morphology in a Cretaceous true crab fossil (Callichimaera), finding that it may have been an active pelagic predator, an ecological role that is rare among modern crabs. This has in turn informed a survey of comparative eye morphology across brachyurans and revealed numerous examples of preserved fossil eyes.\n\n\nIn total, we have published 10 papers and two preprints (with one paper in review, and at least four in preparation) and given 15 conference presentations. We have published large new collections-based datasets, and improved the global availability of crab data in resources such as MorphoSource and the Paleobiology Database.\n\n\nBroader Impacts: Our research has had unprecedented impact on public interest in convergent evolution, turning \"carcinization\" into a household term. Our collaboration with PBS Eons on the viral video \"Why Do Things Keep Evolving Into Crabs?\" was viewed over 10 million times. Our papers have been covered by over 100 major radio and print sources, reaching millions more. Countless memes, artworks, and even products like clothes and toys have been inspired by carcinization and crab biodiversity, and it has become a new standard of convergent evolution taught in undergraduate biology classrooms.\n\n\nDirect training of one postdoctoral researcher (now in a curatorial position), one post-baccalaureate researcher (now in medical school), and one undergraduate student was supported by this award. We leveraged Zoom to cross-train over a dozen members of both Harvard and FIU groups in phylogenetics and paleontology, where specific phylogenetics coursework has not been offered at Harvard during the award period. We addressed the decade-long deficiency of invertebrate paleontology education at Harvard, offering one new graduate level and three undergraduate courses in Invertebrate Paleontology and Geobiology featuring material from this award (serving ~75 students). We taught a technical workshop at the 10th International Crustacean Congress focused on integrating fossils into phylogeny. Finally, we delivered 24 Zoom talks to community college classrooms (13 at minority-serving institutions, reaching ~1000 students) discussing the relationship between evolutionary biology and misinformation, broadening scientific literacy during a period when these skills have been more crucial than ever in society.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/22/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JoannaWolfe\n"
