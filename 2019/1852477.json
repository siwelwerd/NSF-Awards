 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Collaborative Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site: Solar and Alternative Technologies (SALT) will be hosted by the University of Tulsa to encourage undergraduate students to pursue further studies in alternative energy technologies. Among the many issues with fossil fuels are the exhaustion of conventional sources, pollution and water consumption during production, and greenhouse gases formed during burning. Although new sources of fossil fuels are being found and cleaner extraction techniques are being developed, alternatives to fossil fuels are needed that produce fewer greenhouse gases. The overarching goal of the REU's research projects is to advance knowledge and understanding of alternative technologies while reducing dependence on fossil fuels for the production of energy, fuel, clean water, and/or materials. This REU supports the education of students from institutions with few research opportunities, particularly for under-represented groups and first-generation college students. Students will be actively recruited from 2- and 4-year regional institutions in the EPSCOR states Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma, as well as through the national networks of the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation and American Indian Science and Engineering Society chapters. The students will be mentored throughout their summer research to encourage them to continue their studies in graduate work, with a goal of broadening their representation in academic research.\r\n\r\nThe Solar and Alternative Technologies Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site will involve undergraduate students in summer research projects for 10 weeks developing fuel, catalysts, power, clean water, and plastics from renewable sources or using renewable energy. The projects include water desalination and the production of microalgal biofuel, biocatalysts, and nanoellipsoids. More than half of the projects focus on solar energy, ranging from a new way to produce silicon, to the effects of fluid flow patterns on energy production, to the matching of energy resources and needs to create a micro-grid for local energy needs. The undergraduate students will learn about responsible conduct of research, environmental ethics, technical communication through journal articles and oral presentations, and posting about research on social media. Students will give two progress presentations and a final oral report and prepare a final written formal report, similar to a journal article. Tours will include local hydroelectric, solar, wind, geothermal, and waste-to-energy facilities. The goal of the REU is to encourage under-represented groups in the pursuit of graduate studies by mentoring them in undergraduate research. The University of Tulsa will collaborate with Oklahoma State University to evaluate the REU student experience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe Solar and Alternative Technologies Research Experience for Undergraduates (SALT REU) provided research opportunities primarily to undergraduate students who were unlikely to get similar experiences at their home institutions. SALT hosted 31 participants over four summers from 2019 through 2023. The students worked in labs in chemical engineering, chemistry & biochemistry, mechanical engineering, and physics on a wide variety of projects. As they made advances in the understanding of carbon sequestration in coke, biocatalysts, biofuels production from microalgae, erosion of wind turbine blades, and electrodeposition of thin film photovoltaic devices, among other projects, they learned to use new equipment and new analytical techniques. Their graduate student and faculty mentors trained them in the necessary background literature, experimental design, and data analysis.\n\n\nAs part of workforce development, the participants completed training in responsible conduct of research and in oral technical communications. The students presented two short updates and a longer final presentation of their research. A lunch-and-learn session was about the reasons for attending graduate school, how to prepare for graduate school, what graduate school is like, and how to pay for graduate school. The group took field trips to a wind farm, a hydroelectric plant, a waste-to-energy plant, biofuels companies, and solar installations. Pros and cons of each energy type were discussed in the field trips. \n\n\nThe participants were mainly from non-research-intensive institutions (55%). The 22 home institutions were spread across 13 states. The groups were primarily underclassmen, with 42% participants having completed their freshmen year at the time of the REU and another 29% just out of the sophomore year. Women and under-represented minorities were 52% and 35% of the participants, with Native Americans, African Americans, and Hispanics roughly equal. Of the 18 participants who have finished their bachelor degrees, two are working on their PhDs. One former participant is working on an MS, and another has completed an MS. Three of the participants who have not yet graduated are currently planning to attend graduate school.\n\n\nThree participants presented their work in poster sessions at national conferences. Two proceedings papers have been accepted for another student. A journal article is under review for yet another participant. Other journal articles will be forthcoming. \t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/20/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LauraPFord\n"
