 "awd_abstract_narration": "The BMES Annual Meeting is highly interdisciplinary and is the premiere conference for the Biomedical Engineering community, offering programming at the forefront of discovery and education to leading researchers, professionals, leaders and students in the BME field. The BMES Annual Meeting is an ideal venue to hold the BMES-NSF Special Sessions to engage the broadest possible participation, and to stimulate conversations, questions & answers, and new mentoring relationships across faculty, students and professionals. These Special Sessions will allow audience participants to gain a greater awareness of NSF-sponsored research opportunities, attain a better understanding of how to prepare successful BME grant proposals, and offer participants a place to learn from each other as mentors and colleagues.\r\nTwo sessions are planning:\r\n1) BMES-NSF Special Session on CAREER and UNSOLICITED Awards: This BMES-NSF sponsored Special Session is expected to be held at the 2019 BMES Annual Meeting on Friday, October 18, 2019. The goal of the session is to bring together NSF Bioengineering and Engineering Healthcare grantees, young investigators, junior and senior faculty, and postdoctoral trainees for idea exchange and networking related to conducting and funding cutting-edge research in BME.\r\n\r\n2) BMES-NSF Special Session on Graduate Research Fellowships Program (GRFP): This BMES-NSF sponsored Special Session is expected to be held at the 2019 BMES Annual Meeting on Saturday, October 19, 2019. The goal of the session is to bring together program officers, grantees, reviewers and graduate students to highlight the NSF GRFP and inform undergraduate and graduate students on GFRP guidelines and strategies to develop winning GRFP grant proposals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
