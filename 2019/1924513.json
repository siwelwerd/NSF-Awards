 "awd_abstract_narration": "Statistical and machine learning are revolutionizing scientific fields ranging from computer vision, to medicine, to natural language processing, and inference of natural physical laws. Despite these rapid and impressive empirical advances, machine learning remains only partially understood mathematically. In particular, unsupervised anomaly detection in which algorithms must distinguish background from anomaly with no labeled data and active learning in which only a very small but carefully selected number of points may be queried for labels are ripe for transformational advances. As sensors generate ever increasing datasets, the sheer volume of data overwhelms human capacity for generating the kinds of large training sets necessary for traditional supervised learning algorithms. The future of machine learning relies on developing new mathematical approaches to unsupervised and active learning, where no or little training data is required.  Innovations in this direction have potential to transform fields as diverse as computational medicine, network security, and image processing.  This project will support 1 graduate student in the second and third years of the grant.\r\n\r\nThis research project develops new algorithms for anomaly detection and active learning in spatiotemporal data. The emphasis is on the analysis of high-dimensional, time-evolving data sets in a manner that is robust to nonlinear geometries, variable sampling rates, and large quantities of noise and outliers.  The PI proposes two distinct but related lines of research. First, to devise multitemporal anomaly detection algorithms using landscape cluster networks. This approach handles temporally varying distributions and labels clusters and anomalies at different levels of granularity, providing confidence estimates and uncertainty quantifications. Second, diffusion geometric active learning algorithms for spatiotemporal data will be developed to allow a human analyst to label a small number of queries from the algorithm. These queries are carefully chosen, and the labels provided by the human analyst can radically improve cluster and anomaly detection at minimal computational burden. The proposed methods are robust to complicated data geometries, temporal sampling rates, noise and outliers, and ambient dimensionality of the data. Beyond the topics of machine learning, this project makes broader contributions to probability theory, harmonic analysis, spectral graph theory, high-dimensional statistics, and computational linear algebra.  Mathematical and algorithmic contributions will be developed in parallel with scientific collaborations analyzing large spatiotemporal datasets. This project focuses on anomaly detection and active learning in three distinct spatiotemporal data settings: large-scale commuting networks, hyperspectral image analysis, and high energy particle physics. The proposed methods allow for real-time anomaly and threat detection, are scalable, and mitigate the need for large training sets.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project focused on the development of novel graph and optimal transport-based methods for active learning, clustering, low-dimensional representation learning, and applications to image processing, biological networks, and molecular dynamics. \n\nThe Learning by Active Nonlinear Diffusion (LAND) algorithm was proposed and theoretically analyzed, showing it enjoys strong performance guarantees.  Extensions to multiscale cluster analysis were also developed.  The basic LAND scheme was specialized to image processing by incorporating spatial statistics into the underlying graph construction, allowing for smooth and high-accuracy labeling of high-dimensional hyperspectral images.  This was applied to benchmark data as well as novel datasets collected by remote sensing scientists, allowing for efficient detection of ash dieback disease.  Clustering methods were also applied to develop compression and reduced order modeling tools for molecular dynamics simulations.  Extensions to heterogenous biological network link and function prediction were also developed in collaboration with computational biologists.\n\nNotions of low-dimensional parametrization for measures in Wasserstein space were proposed and analyzed.  Algorithms for efficient projection and computation in these models were developed and applied to image processing and natural lanaguage analysis.  Connections to change point detection and dictionary learning in Wasserstein space were also developed and applied to a range of real data.  This inquiry lays the foundation for ongoing investigations into harmonic analysis and statistical learning in the Wasserstein space and the development of novel data science tools in this context.\n\nIn total, over 20 peer reviewed papers partially supported by this grant were published, with more in review at the time of the writing of this report.  8 publically available software toolboxes were released as part of the work done in this grant, ensuring that computational aspects of the research performed under this grant are reproducible.\n\nFive REU students were supported on this grant across two different summer cohorts of visiting research students from underrepresented backgrounds.  Over the course of this grant, 3 PhD students were supported.  The first PhD student in math graduated in May 2022, with a second math PhD student and a computer science PhD student both scheduled to graduate in May 2024.  Over 30 invited research talks were given on topics pertaining to this grant with 7 workshops and symposia organized through the AMS, SIAM, IEEE, and ICERM, with a focus on achieving parity for underrepresented groups in mathematics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James M Murphy"
