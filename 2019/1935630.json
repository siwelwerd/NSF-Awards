 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will advance human health and well-being, contribute to national security, and advance science through a better understanding of illicit mineral supply chains and ways to disrupt them. Currently in Peru, a large portion of the gold exports are illegal, and other materials central to mining activities are also trafficked, including mercury, explosives, and equipment. However, there are no organized transactional records of illicit activities related to the gold supply chain in Peru, which presents a significant challenge in making decisions to combat them and results in the loss of billions of dollars every year. Furthermore, it is nearly impossible to address the conditions (e.g. child labor and human trafficking) that can be associated with these illicit supply networks and which often extend across international borders. Through an examination of the various networks within and outside of Peru that comprise and facilitate the illicit gold supply chain, this research will advance knowledge of the illicit gold supply chain in Peru and expand the methodological toolbox used to evaluate and understand mineral and other illicit supply chains globally. This project will also train STEM graduate students in interdisciplinary research methodologies and provide them with opportunities to engage in research with societal impacts. \r\n\r\nThis research involves an interdisciplinary team of engineers, social scientists, and attorneys and employs a systems theory approach. Under this approach, the research will include qualitative analyses of legal documents and court cases, as well as ethnographic field work to build a systems dynamics model that captures the structure of the illicit gold supply chain, formalizes the connections among the systems components, and highlights the chains of causal links and feedback loops within the system. This analysis will be used to identify the common pathways of materials (i.e. gold, mercury, explosives) and people (i.e. miners, traders) in the illicit gold supply chain within Peru and across Peru's borders and will provide an indication of the criticalities and vulnerabilities within the system. Using the outputs of these analyses, a mathematical optimization model of the supply chain will be formulated, and a set of decisions will be prescribed to disrupt the illicit activities throughout the supply chain. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to test the behavior of illicit activities under various disruption scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

By integrating legal reviews, literature analyses, field-based qualitative and quantitative data, and system dynamics and optimization modeling, we have deepened understandings of how these complex supply chains function and where critical disruptions may occur.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our research has advanced the state of knowledge in supply chains analyses by developing and validating three system dynamics models for key gold mining regions in Peru&mdash;Arequipa, Madre de Dios, and Puno. At each site, extensive data collection, including policy inventories, legal documents, news articles, and in-depth interviews with miners, government officials, and NGO representatives provided us with a comprehensive understanding of the scope of inputs and outputs that comprise the gold supply chains. This approach allowed us to accurately map the flows of materials, such as mercury, fuel, and gold and use these data to populate the baseline system dynamics model for each region.</p>\r\n<p>The models revealed that gold supply chains are highly context-specific, varying with the nature of ore deposits, mining techniques, processing methods, and the availability of resources. They are also highly integrated and susceptible to internal fluctuations, such as changes in operational practices, equipment availability, labor dynamics, and external fluctuations, including adverse weather events and public health emergencies. For example, in Madre de Dios, we simulated a flooding scenario in our baseline system dynamics model. This simulation exposed critical vulnerabilities in the supply chain, particularly the heavy reliance on fuel and mercury supplies, which are essential for mining operations yet highly sensitive to supply disruptions. In Puno, our research extended these findings, and our fieldwork and interviews provided insights on the intersections between formal and informal mining. This region-specific data informed the creation of an optimization model that evaluated the feasibility of transitioning miners to a central cyanide processing facility. This integrated approach not only highlights the dynamic challenges within these supply chains but also underscores the potential for targeted interventions to enhance resilience and mitigate illicit practices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, our research demonstrated that traditional top-down regulatory approaches often fall short in effectively disrupting illicit supply chains. Disrupting one node frequently prompts illicit actors to quickly adapt and re-establish their activities at alternative nodes in the network. Instead, our findings advocate for a bottom-up strategy that emphasizes capacity building among informal artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) operators. This strategy involves targeted training programs, financial and technical assistance, and the development of infrastructures that facilitate compliance with regulatory standards. By helping ASGM operators achieve and maintain formal status, this approach not only improves their economic viability and working conditions but also offers a more resilient and effective means of mitigating illicit practices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Throughout our project, we have actively engaged with policymakers, industry representatives, and community stakeholders to disseminate our findings and inform decision making. Our work has been shared with Peruvian legislators and regulators through invited talks, workshops and direct meetings, and it has reached a global audience via online platforms such as the GOXI information hub, which hosted our case study on environmental and social management of the ASGM sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we have mentored three graduate students and supported undergraduate research. These efforts have fostered interdisciplinary training in ethnographic methods and system dynamics and optimization modeling, equipping students with the skills to address complex challenges in the extractive industries. Additionally, our legal team, comprising both senior and junior researchers, has benefited from hands-on experience in legal research and cross-disciplinary collaboration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our integrated approach to studying gold supply chains has set a new benchmark for convergence research. By merging qualitative insights with quantitative models, our work has provided innovative analytical tools that can be adapted to other data-scare environments globally.
