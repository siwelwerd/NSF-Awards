 "awd_abstract_narration": "Appalachian peaks are home to many animal species found nowhere else on Earth, including many new species of arthropods (insects, millipedes, and relatives) that await discovery and description. The highest Appalachian mountains (>5000 feet) harbor spruce-fir forests that are relicts of Pleistocene times. These unique communities are threatened by invasive species and habitat loss. However, a lack of information about native species diversity hinders their conservation. This project, a collaboration between Clemson University and Virginia Tech, will fill in large biodiversity knowledge gaps for the arthropods in these unique forests, and will share this information with federal and state land managers responsible for conservation. The project team, with student trainees, will visit each of these spruce-fir 'islands' to survey the arthropods, and will then make a biological library of the species using genomic tools. These tools will allow rapid identification of the hundreds of distinct species, and comparison will reveal the uniqueness of each mountain's inhabitants, as well as their evolutionary histories. The research team, composed of graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral trainees and senior personnel, will work together on data collection and analysis, publishing, and outreach phases of the project. Public events such as lectures and workshops with state and national parks in the region and short videos will share the activities and findings of the project with the widest possible audience.\r\n            \r\nThe specific goals of the project are to: (1) assess diversity at 22 of the highest points in the southern Appalachian Mountains; (2) establish a high throughput sequencing approach to efficiently document leaf litter arthropods; (3) assess the magnitude and geographic scale of endemism and cryptic species diversity; and (4) increase appreciation for the diversity and uniqueness of high elevation faunas, and highlight the urgency to protect them. A voucher-based metabarcoding workflow, utilizing COI and 16S amplicons, will be used as the basis for comparison among communities. This will establish a database of barcode sequences for many novel taxa and yield a rich data set for resolving species boundaries and population relationships. Data analyses will employ phylogenetic, population genetic, and other statistical methods to address questions of evolutionary relationships, historical connectivity and environmental determinants of diversity. Anticipated results include dozens of newly discovered species, thousands of barcode sequences for species as-yet-unrepresented in public databases, and a deep understanding of biogeographic histories for a great swath of diversity across an area of high conservation value.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Many of these peaks host a unique coniferous forest composed of red spruce and Fraser fir. This cool-adapted and boreal forest type presents the biota of the region with a series of &lsquo;sky-islands&rsquo; of suitable habitat for plants and animals that are otherwise restricted to cooler and wetter regions to the north. The spruce-fir forest is known to harbor a number of endemic plant and animal species, species found nowhere else but in these isolated fragments, or even restricted to particular peaks. However, the bulk of the arthropod fauna living in these forests remains very poorly known. With these unusual environmental conditions threatened by changing climate, it is critical that these faunas be better documented so that we know how to effectively manage and protect them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over the course of this project our team sampled more than 30 high elevation sites across the southern Appalachians, collecting over 200 individual leaf litter samples. From these we sorted hundreds of thousands of specimens, and generated DNA barcodes for about 8,000 of them. These sequences served as the basis for almost 30 publications, most coauthored with postdoctoral, graduate, and/or undergraduate researchers. We found very high numbers of species, with as many as 200 arthropod species in the leaf litter at any given site. The high resolving power of DNA sequences provided deeper insights into this diversity, indicating that as many as a third of the species at each site in fact live only a particular site. Many of these unique species are &lsquo;cryptic,&rsquo; recognizable only by unique genetic signatures or by subtle, often internal anatomical characters, highlighting the importance of molecular sequences in biodiversity documentation. However, we also found that databases for the identification of species using their DNA barcodes have very sparse representation of small, unpopular &lsquo;dark taxa&rsquo;; even in the best known groups like spiders we could identify no more than half the species collected. Only 20% of beetles were identifiable using barcodes, and 0% of springtails. These results indicate a great need to improve the representation in these reference databases.</p>\n<p>We used the sequencing results as the jumping off point to name and describe numerous new species. Three graduate student dissertation projects relied on material from this project, together naming and describing over 50 new species of beetles from the area, a number of them along with their associated larvae. Thanks to the expertise of the project&rsquo;s postdoc, we also named new species of terrestrial isopods and millipedes. Moreover, following some molecular explorations within some particularly poorly known groups, our publications attracted taxonomic specialists to borrow and study our specimens to look more closely at the diversity in pseudoscorpions, diplurans, proturans, and springtails. So numerous spin-off publications are expected to continue to appear based on this work, and several ongoing collaborations have been established.</p>\n<p>To share our results with a broad audience, we utilized some online resources, such as iNaturalist and Flickr. Every specimen that we sequenced was photographed, and these photographs were posted to these platforms, with as much identifying information as we could provide. In many hundreds of cases our identifications were improved by online contributing experts, helping to build a reasonably comprehensive portrait of the diversity of numerous obscure arthropod groups. Some of these were also featured in popular media, such as the &lsquo;Through the Loupe&rsquo; feature in American Entomologist (image included). Project personnel interacted closely with biologists and conservation specialists with the National and State Park Services, as well as non-profits like Discover Life in America. In addition to fieldwork with some of these representatives, we provided lectures to audiences of land managers and the general public to raise awareness of the unique high Appalachian litter arthropod fauna.
