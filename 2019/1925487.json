 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses Avian feather lice as a model system to better understand how ecological interactions shape evolutionary patterns. Avian feather lice have repeatedly evolved particular morphologies, they live on different parts of the host's body and they differ in how they escape host defense. For example, some species of lice have evolved to be very thin and narrow and can fit between the barbs of the wing feathers where they cannot be easily removed, while others have evolved large mandibles to bite down on the feathers. The purpose of this study is to better understand the process of how these repeated adaptations have occurred in response to interactions with their hosts. \r\nThis proposal will involve extensive training of three graduate students and a postdoc in both molecular and morphological analysis and support further development of the software aTRAM. A module for undergraduate education will be developed in collaboration with NSF funded Biodiversity Literacy in Undergraduate Education (BLUE).\r\n\r\n\t\r\nTo study repeated evolutionary adaptation this study will use genomic, morphological, and species interaction data to elucidate the pattern and processes underlying repeated co-evolutionary events. The main objectives are to 1) Sequence whole genomes of 280 species of feather lice to determine the number of repeated adaptive radiations in this group; 2) Use morphological measurements from both CT scanned and slide mounted specimens to examine morphological convergence with each ecomorph; 3) Use these sequenced genomes to identify genes with signatures of selection that are associated with ecomorph transitions; and 4) Compare the phylogeny of the lice with that of their avian hosts to evaluate whether ecomorph transitions occur more often at major host switching events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nParasites comprise around half of all the species of life on earth. They are major components of ecosystems and can limit the populations of their hosts. One fundamental question is how and why parasites have diversified to such an extent? This question can be investigated by uncovering the pattern of how species of parasites are related to each other and comparing this pattern to ecological relationships and morphological features. This project addressed this question for a major group of parasites, the feather lice that are parasitic on birds. These parasites eat the feathers of the birds on which they live. One prominent feature of this group is that they differ dramatically in how they escape from the preening defenses of their hosts. Head lice live exclusively on the birds head, where birds cannot preen with their bills. These lice have strong mandibles that they use to hang on to the head feathers to avoid being removed by scratching. Results of detailed morphological scans indicated that head lice have expanded muscles that attach to these mandibles, enhancing their grip. Head lice have a broad triangular head shape that supports these expanded muscles. In contrast, wing lice have a long and slender body form and are adapted to inserting themselves in the spaces between the feather barbs of the wing feathers to avoid being removed by host preening. Body lice have a rounded body form adapted to burrowing in the downy portions of the body feathers to escape preening. Finally, some feather lice are more generalized in body form and move around various parts of the body of their hosts. These differences are categorized as ecomorphs which relate to major differences in morphology and the escape behaviors of these parasites.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis study used genome sequences for over 250 species of feather lice to reconstruct a tree of relationships among them. Using this tree, the history of changes in ecomorphology was reconstructed to determine which ecomorph was the ancestral condition and how many changes in ecomorph occurred over time. The tree of relationships for the feather louse parasites was also compared to the tree of relationships for their avian hosts. From this comparison, the history of how these lice switched between different groups of birds was also determined. Results of these comparisons indicated that the ancestral feather louse was a generalist with many transitions to other ecomorphs over time. These transitions were significantly associated with branches in the tree where lice also switched between host groups or diversified within a single avian lineage. Thus, overall the results of the project indicated that how parasites escape from host defenses has a major impact on their diversification and how they can switch between different host species.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the intellectual merits of this study, this project also had several broader impacts. This project produced genome sequences for a broad diversity of feather lice. Beyond the use of these genome sequences for building a tree of relationships, these sequences were used in other studies to uncover the beneficial bacteria that reside inside these insects that provide them with additional vitamins not found in their feather specialized diet. The genomic data generated for this project have also been made publicly available to other scientists, and have many other potential uses for other areas of science, such as the genetic basis of traits, uncovering population processes, and studies of genome organization. This project also provided training opportunities for four graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher, who were all directly involved in the project. In addition, regular video conferencing meetings were held between the research teams of this project at different institutions, fostering additional training and collaboration. Results of this project were also highlighted in a public press release and press reports on the project, making these results more accessible to the public.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KevinPJohnson\n"
