 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to significantly reduce the cost of electric vehicles (EV). The software platform technology streamlines the design of vehicle swapping networks using a life-cycle approach to scale subsidies. The initial focus will impact existing EV owners and members of peer-to-peer car-sharing platforms. The platform can be customized for a wide range of transportation needs that may benefit from occasional access to specialized vehicles.  The ability to efficiently swap vehicles within a network of drivers and to scale subsidies to the benefits of a specific network will result in reduction in transportation costs that may attract a wide range of users. New users will not need to form their own networks but will be able to build onto initial networks, adding new functions and greater geographic diversity.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project aims to enable drivers to swap vehicles within a network of long-range and short-range electric vehicles (EV's). Recent advances in life-cycle assessment research provide the knowledge needed to develop a software platform that can allow transportation businesses to estimate life-cycle emissions which provide access to federal, state, and local subsidies that are essential to EV profitability.  In particular, life-cycle assessment studies have recently developed regionalized models that account for spatially explicit constraints on emissions as well as detailed impact inventories of battery manufacturing processes. A software application that can assist in the optimal design of these networks to reduce cost and optimize greenhouse gas savings will enhance both the user ability to afford sustainable transportation and the public agency ability to scale subsidies to the actual benefits of a specific vehicle network.  The system leverages research results in life-cycle assessment on electric vehicles that quantifies the economic cost and greenhouse gas emissions across a range of product stages including raw material extraction, manufacturing, vehicle use, and end-of-life recycling and disposal.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nTransportation is the U.S.\u2019s single largest source of CO2 pollution, and this is mostly due to personal vehicles.  While electric vehicles are a rapidly emerging solution to this CO2 problem, critical barriers to adoption for some consumers are costs, range, and environmental impacts of batteries.  Our research group developed a novel approach to car-sharing that addresses these barriers.  In particular, our product is a software planning tool that designs the optimal distribution of vehicle types in the swapping network in order to maximize cost saving and minimize greenhouse gas emissions.  However, the potential consumer demand and broader business model ecosystem for this car-sharing service has yet to be explored.  To address this knowledge gap, our I-Corps project conducted extensive customer discovery research including 141 interviews with individual drivers, enterprise customers, and policy-makers who manage large fleets of vehicles.  The customer discovery research was used to define the marketability but also several design parameters such as the number of long-range driving days and the types of long-range vehicles.  The customer archetypes that emerged from this research provide key insights into pathways for business development while also distinguishing the market segment from existing competitors.  In particular, we eliminated the enterprise customer segment (companies that manage large fleets, e.g. Enterprise, and small fleets, e.g. University of Boulder) that were unlikely to see the transition to electric fleets and the need for a solution as an immediate need.  However, our interviews that focused on the business-to-consumer model, identified urban and suburban drivers from a mix of middle- and upper-income segments who demonstrated a need for an EV solution that was not provided by existing products and services but might be addressed through our EV swapping network.  A value proposition that was identified in these interviews was a desire to have regular access to cars through a service model that was distinct from traditional own and lease models.  In future work, the business-to-consumer model will be pursued through a larger interview sample to identify patterns in the customer archetype.  We shared our findings of our customer discovery research through public forums hosted by regional organizations (Monterey Bay Community Power, Rotary, and Ecology Action) in order to disseminate the sustainability benefits of this technological innovation to a broader audience.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/09/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John E Campbell"
