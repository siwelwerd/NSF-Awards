 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will investigate new ways to control powered prosthetic and orthotic (P&O) devices to assist lower-limb amputees and stroke survivors with the mobility activities needed to navigate their homes and communities. With existing P&O devices, mobility is often limited by stairs, slopes, and uneven terrains. State-of-the-art powered P&O devices are capable of overcoming these obstacles, but most current advanced control methods are specialized to a limited set of specific pre-defined motions -- for example, walking, running, and ascending or descending stairs. Existing approaches must infer the user's intention and switch to the most closely matching pre-defined activity. Even if user intention is correctly interpreted, the desired motion may not match any of the pre-determined options. In contrast, the P&O devices enabled by this project will provide mobility for a continuously changing variety of tasks, including the ability to respond to changing and unanticipated slope and footing conditions. In addition to restoring natural function, the investigated control approach can also adjust the physical environment as experienced by the user. For example, the apparent weight and mass of the user could be reduced to provide increased stability during physical therapy, or even to enhance natural capabilities. This work will significantly improve quality of life and productivity for nearly a million lower-limb amputees, and even more stroke survivors, in the US alone. The integrated education plan will have broad impact by 1) promoting disability awareness and increasing interest in STEM among K-12 and college students, 2) fostering mutual understanding between engineering and P&O students through joint education and research, and 3) educating P&O students in STEM concepts that will be needed to utilize the projected P&O technologies in their future clinical practice.\r\n\r\nThis project supports a paradigm shift from task-specific, kinematic control approaches to task-invariant, energetic control approaches for powered P&O devices that can assist lower-limb amputees and stroke survivors across varying activities. This project will advance knowledge in the control of powered P&O devices through energy shaping, where the parameters and/or formula for the human body's energy are altered in closed loop to achieve more desirable dynamics. In this approach, wearable actuators could reduce mass/inertia parameters in body energetics to dynamically offload the weight of a stroke patient who otherwise would be supported by multiple therapists during gait rehabilitation. Powered prosthetic legs could provide support and propulsion during amputee locomotion by shaping the momentum of the human body. Accordingly, the goals of this project are to 1) understand how to use wearable actuators to shape the energetics of the human body during locomotion, 2) determine specific changes to body energetics that lead to effective control strategies for powered prosthetic legs and powered leg orthoses (i.e., exoskeletons), and 3) understand how different gaits (i.e., kinematic patterns) emerge from body energetics in order to design task-invariant controllers for powered P&O devices. This innovation in dynamics and control will enable P&O devices to assist humans in a continuum of locomotor activities, which cannot be achieved with state-of-art control strategies based on pre-defined, task-specific joint kinematics.",

Even with the help of conventional prostheses and orthoses, patient mobility is often limited by stairs, slopes, and uneven terrains. Emerging powered devices use motors to actively assist patient mobility, but these devices are typically limited to a small set of pre-determined activities or motions; they cannot seamlessly adapt to changes in the user?s activity or environment. The primary result of this project is a new control methodology that enables powered prostheses and orthoses to inject or remove energy from the human body in order to assist the user across varying activities. This control approach, known as energy shaping, does not rely on pre-defined motions like previous control methods, which provides greater flexibility to different conditions and users. This project determined which energetic properties of the human body can and should be shaped by a wearable robot with fewer motors than body joints (known as underactuation). These energetic properties include gravity compensation, inertia compensation, and virtual springs and dampers, which can be selected by intuition or through data-driven optimization to best replicate normative human joint torques given normative joint angles/velocities and ground contact forces as inputs to the control algorithm. These control methods were successfully implemented on several powered orthoses (i.e., exoskeletons), including a unilateral ankle exoskeleton, unilateral ankle-knee exoskeleton, bilateral hip exoskeleton, and modular hip and/or knee system. Studies with able-bodied human participants demonstrated that the control method assisted volitional human motion in a manner that reduced muscle activation for critical muscles during challenging activities such as sit-stand, ramp ascent, and stair ascent. These preclinical results demonstrate the potential for assisting mobility in individuals with weakened musculature (e.g., elderly) or impaired neuromotor control (e.g., stroke or other neurological impairments).</p>\n<p>While the exoskeleton application relies on the human limb to produce volitional joint patterns, the prosthetic application must produce the joint patterns in the absence of a human limb. This inspired two control methods related to energy shaping: one using angular momentum to modify pre-determined joint patterns, and another using virtual springs and dampers (known as impedance control) to produce compliant, biomimetic interaction between the prosthesis, user, and environment. When implemented on a powered knee-ankle prosthesis, both methods were able to produce biomimetic trends in energy injection/removal at the joints across walking speeds. Moreover, the impedance control method enabled biomimetic adaptations of joint patterns to ground inclination, allowing the above-knee amputee participants to seamlessly navigate a variable speed/incline testing environment. These results will allow individuals with lower-limb amputations to navigate their home and community more freely and confidently.</p>\n<p>Over the project period, six U.S. citizens and four international students contributed to this project as PhD students, including two women and one underrepresented minority. Several undergraduate students also participated as researchers. More broadly, this project impacted the prosthetics-orthotics field by 1) developing robotic prosthetics-orthotics technology that will promote better patient outcomes than conventional devices, 2) fostering mutual understanding between engineering and prosthetics-orthotics students/residents through integrated research and education, and 3) educating prosthetics-orthotics residents and practitioners in technical concepts that will be needed to utilize robotic prosthetics-orthotics technologies in their future clinical practices.
