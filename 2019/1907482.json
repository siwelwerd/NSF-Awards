 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1\r\nDespite decades of work on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) at the national level, the geosciences remain the least diverse of STEM fields. Welcoming geoscientists with diverse backgrounds and abilities into this field requires multi-directional action by all members of geology departments. The Geology Department at Western Washington University (WWU) seeks to develop its capacity to address issues of DEI through several targeted interventions. In order to build a more inclusive Geology Department at WWU, we will create a comprehensive\r\nprogram consisting of five components: 1) Development of a new Lab Camp capstone course option in addition to traditional Field Camp; 2) Ongoing renovation of the Field Camp capstone to make the course more accessible; 3) Workshops for graduate student Teaching Assistants\r\nfocused on inclusive teaching practices; 4) Professional development opportunities for WWU Geology faculty focused on DEI; and 5) Department seminar speakers who focus on topics related to DEI. This program emphasizes the development of a new Lab Camp because doing\r\nso will create a more accessible alternative to the traditional Field Camp model and it will provide students with opportunities to develop high-impact lab-based research skills that are increasingly valuable in geoscience professions. Creating a more inclusive and accessible department will result in the recruitment and retention of a more diverse population of undergraduate and graduate students. Once implemented, this model for change can be adapted and transferred to other geology programs nationwide.\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\nField Camp is the most common form of capstone course offered in undergraduate geoscience programs in the United States. About half of all geoscience students participate in some version of field camp while earning their bachelor's degree, and those who do not are often encouraged to participate in other types of field experiences. Most undergraduate geoscience programs also emphasize learning in the field by including a range of field experiences in regular coursework. However, little research has been conducted on the learning benefits of field-based geoscience capstone courses. This project will examine the learning benefits of field camp capstone courses\r\nby (1) characterizing the educational impact of field-based and lab-based courses and (2) comparing the two experiences. To evaluate this, we will use pre- and post-course assessments of learning gains. The research team will also measure accessibility and inclusion in field and lab camp courses by leading students in ongoing qualitative analysis activities. Focus groups and interviews will be used to evaluate the impact of the program on faculty and graduate student instructors? views on accessibility and inclusion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In fact, field camp is sometimes considered a de facto boot camp, an experience that pushes students to their intellectual, physical, and emotional limits. While this type of challenging environment helps some students bond and grow into their newfound geoscientist identity together, the same environment can alienate other students, especially those from minoritized groups. For this reason, field camp is considered one of the many reasons that the geosciences attract far fewer students from underrepresented groups than other STEM fields (Bernard &amp; Cooperdock, 2018).
