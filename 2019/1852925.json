 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, this Track 1: Scholarships & Stipends project at Texas Lutheran University aims to serve the national need of preparing high-quality STEM K-12 teachers for high-need school districts. The project has the potential to advance collaboration between science and education faculty in addressing the critical shortage of teachers in STEM fields in Texas. Through partnerships with regional high-need school districts, the project will recruit biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics majors for high school teaching careers. The project will support at least twenty new teachers with scholarships, mentoring, and specialized training for their transition to and success in the classroom. Undergraduate recipients will receive up to two years of scholarship support to complete the Bachelor of Science degree in their selected discipline, while also completing requirements that prepare them to successfully obtain teaching certification upon graduation. \r\n \r\nThe project focuses on the intersection of passion for teaching, cultural awareness, and modern science and mathematics practices. As such, the project will implement best-practice techniques for training teachers to identify cultural barriers, recognize and address related issues, and promote inclusion for broad participation in STEM fields. The emphasis on culturally responsive teaching using research-based pedagogies will be the hallmark of the program. Noyce Scholars will participate in extracurricular enrichment activities designed to broaden cultural perspectives and foster passion for and commitment to teaching as a career. A key component of the project is the support and engagement of program graduates through continued virtual and in-person connections with STEM and Education faculty at Texas Lutheran University. In-service teachers will participate in professional development workshops at the University and be supported by experienced mentors at one of the four partnering high-need regional school districts. This work aims to increase understanding of how the small liberal arts college setting, combined with close faculty-student mentoring, nurturing of passion and vocation, and rigorous preparation in STEM content areas, can affect the recruitment, motivation, and persistence of STEM teachers. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts and experienced and exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The primary goal was to increase the production of STEM majors certified to teach 7-12 STEM subjects, aimed at meeting the multiple high-needs school districts in south-central Texas. This effort was implemented through positive career awareness style recruiting, highlighting the benefits of teaching as a career option. The project also encouraged interest in teaching through creative, informal&nbsp; \"try teaching\" programs. The second objective of the project was to provide pre-service teachers with cultural awareness growth opportunities in all aspects of their preparation, including STEM courses. This required involvement of faculty mentors and co-curricular modules for pre-service teachers. Lastly, the project aimed to keep the close-knit undergraduate community in place by providing consistent, caring post-graduation support to ensure that TLU Noyce Scholars pursue long-term employment as classroom teachers. The program, called TLU TOP Dogs, started of with an afternoon \"signing ceremony\" where friends and family, along with the campus community, were invited to join the celebration as the first four TLU Noyce scholars committed to their interest in becoming STEM teachers at the secondary level, as shown in the photos.</p>\n<p>PIs worked with several surrounding school districts to find strong secondary STEM mentors for pre-service student teachers and continued this connection as teachers entered service.
