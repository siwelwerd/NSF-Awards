 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will provide funding in support of participation by U.S. graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, and early-career researchers at the Third International Symposium on Nanoporous Materials by Alloy Corrosion on February 24-28, 2019 in Philadelphia, PA.  The presentations and discussion/collaboration fostered at the symposium will highlight new aspects of nanoporous materials synthesis and properties, as well as develop the guiding principles that will outline future directions for the field in applications such as catalysis, fuel cells, plasmonic devices, and sensors.  The symposium will provide a rare opportunity to bring together a diverse group of industrial and academic researchers in a common setting under conditions that will promote research collaboration and identification of new technological opportunities for nanoporous materials. Key outcomes will be a journal article describing future directions for the field, and education of young researchers about career opportunities related to nanoporous materials.    \r\n\r\nNanoporous metals and nanoporous materials, in general, span many fields of basic science and they see utility in a broad range of applications. Full realization of the useful properties of nanoporous materials and development of synthesis strategies that facilitate control of those properties would create substantial impact over a broad range of applications. To this end, the conference will facilitate information sharing and collaboration that would not be possible outside of the meeting.  One of the keys to the impact of this meeting is the targeted involvement of graduate students and early career scientists. The combination of young scientist talks, nightly poster sessions, and a communal atmosphere between established scientists and young graduate students will have an important and lasting impact on the future careers of the younger attendees.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
