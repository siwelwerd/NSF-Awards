 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this NSF CAREER project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Tianbiao Liu of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Utah State University is developing low-cost, tunable, and well-defined redox active molecules for aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs).  These flow batteries are useful for low-cost and more environmentally-friendly energy storage.  The project focuses on the in-depth understanding of the structure and battery performance relationships of battery components. The new knowledge provides guidance in developing low-cost redox active molecules for the use of redox flow batteries as a environmentally-friendly and scalable energy storage platform, thus, alleviating the global reliance on fossil fuels and enhancing the sustainable development of our society. The project lies at the interface of organic, inorganic, materials, and electrochemistry, and is therefore well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.  Professor Liu develops educational programs serving Utah Stat University and wider communities throughout the State of Utah. Students at all education levels participate in building the necessary talent pool of the next generation of scientists and engineers to work in the critically important and emerging field of renewable energy storage. Specifically, Professor Liu works with the USU Eastern Blanding Native American Summer Mentorship Program (NASMP) and the USU Stars Program. These programs focus on attracting and training native American students who are underrepresented in STEM disciplines and on stimulating interest and curiosity in science of academically-talented local high school students. \r\n\r\nAqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) employing redox active organic molecules have been demonstrated to be highly attractive for energy storage. Previous studies of AORFBs have primarily emphasized full flow battery performance using redox active molecules. However, few studies have paid attention to the in-depth understanding of the correlation between physicochemical properties of individual redox active molecules and their battery performance. This project focuses on the molecular engineering and property studies of redox active viologens (anolyte), ferrocenes (catholyte) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy molecules (catholyte), and their battery performance in AORFBs.  These three classes of redox active molecules are investigated to answer the following questions: 1) How do the molecular structures of redox active molecules determine their physicochemical properties including solubility, redox potential, number of electrons involving redox processes, diffusion coefficient, electron transfer rate constants, and membrane permeability? 2) How do the functional groups of redox active molecules influence their chemical and electrochemical stabilities in both charged and discharged states? and 3) Can superior redox active molecules be developed through in-depth mechanistic understandings to enable high energy and high power densities, long cycling redox flow batteries?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Research Outcomes&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Aqueous redox flow batteries represent one of the most promising energy storage technologies for the integration of renewable energy and balancing the electricity grids with a capacity scale of up to GW/GWh and a time scale of from minutes to days, because of the technical merits of decoupled energy and power, high power input and output, and non-flammable and low cost aqueous support-ing electrolytes. &nbsp;To address the challenges encountered by existing inorganic RFBs, we initiated the development of pH neutral AORFBs employing water-soluble viologen (anolyte), TEMPO (catho-lyte), ferrocene (catholyte), and ferrocyanide molecules. First, redox-active molecules consisting of earth-abundant elements are sustainable and affordable. Second, synthetic tunability could lead to desired energy storage properties, including high oxidation/reduction redox potentials, high solubili-ty, and low permeability. Particularly, pH neutral AORFBs are free of corrosion, safer, and envi-ronmentally benign compared to acidic and alkaline RFBs. The PI&rsquo;s NSF career award, which ended in January 2024, has been centered on redox active viologen anolyte molecules (substituted 4,4&prime;-bipyridinium dihalide) coupled with a variety of redox active catholyte molecules, including water soluble TEMPO, ferrocene, and ferrocyanide neutral AORFBs (Figure 1). This NSF career award has been very productive, yielding 14 research articles, 2 invited reviews, and 1 invited perspective.&nbsp;We have developed cationic and anionic viologen molecules with redox potential around -0.39 to -0.45 V vs. NHE as one electron storage anolytes for anion exchange and cation exchange AORFBs (see Figure 1). &nbsp;Correspondingly, we have developed ammonium functionalized ferrocene and TEMPO as catholytes for anion exchange AORFBs and ferrocyanide for cation exchange AORFBs (Figure 2). Our studies have established that ionic substituted viologens are highly stable anolytes molecules for one electron storage for pH neutral AORFBs, which is also further confirmed by follow-up studies by others. For the catholyte side, we have advanced the molecule designs for ferrocene, TEMPO, and ferrocyanide and gained a significant understanding of their cycling stabil-ity. Up to now, ammonium functionalized ferrocene (e.g., C3-FcNCl) and TEMPO &nbsp;(e.g., N2-TEMPO) are the most stable catholytes for pH neutral anion exchange AORFBs. Ammonium ferro-cyanide, (NH4)4[Fe(CN)6], is the most capacity dense and stable catholyte for pH neutral cation ex-change AORFBs. However, it is worth noting that the energy storage performance of viologen AORFBs is limited by the catholyte in terms of cycling stability.&nbsp;&nbsp; For pH neutral cation exchange AORFBs, the combination of (NPr)2V and N2-TEMPO is the top performer and exhibited 1.35 V cell voltage and stable cycling up to 400 cycles at 1.0 M or 26.8 Ah/L capacity (Figures 2A and 2B). &nbsp;The combination of 3,4-S2V and (NH4)4[Fe(CN)6] (Figures 2C and 2D) was demonstrated at 13.0 Wh/L for 1700 cycles or 100 days without observing chemical degradation. Furthermore, a 13.0 Wh/L 3,4-S2V / (NH4)4[Fe(CN)6] AORFB was demonstrated for 50 days of authentic energy storage with total capacity retention of 97.77% or a temporal capacity re-tention rate of 99.955% per day, representing the most stable, longest cycled AORFB to date. In ad-dition, it is worth highlighting that the 3,4-S2V / (NH4)4[Fe(CN)6] flow battery is the first AORFB being verified for calendar energy storage up to 50 days to date. The reported energy storage per-formance of 3,4-S2V stands as a new record for organic flow batteries, superior to all reported AORFBs.&nbsp;In the past five years, we have conducted comprehensive spectroscopic, electrochemical, and computational studies to gain an in-depth understanding of the relationship between the structure and properties of these molecules and their battery performance. We understood how N-substituents of viologen molecules affect their solubility, chemical stability, redox potential, diffu-sion, and charge transfer rates. We also developed degradation mechanisms for the ferrocene and ferrocyanide catholyte molecules. The new fundamental knowledge obtained from this NSF career award will lead to developing competent and low-cost redox active molecules for their utilization in redox flow batteries as a green and scalable renewable energy storage platform, thereby alleviating our reliance on fossil fuels and enhancing the sustainable development of our society.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><br />II.
