 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF IUCRC Center for Solid-State Green Electric Power Generation and Storage (CEPS) is based on long-term partnerships between universities, industry, national laboratories, and state and federal institutions. The IUCRC CEPS goal is focused on fundamental mechanisms of novel superfast solid-state glass-ceramic conductors and on correlation of these mechanisms with respect to corresponding solid-state energy storage. The IUCRC CEPS will advance the NSF mission by expanding fundamental scientific knowledge related to charge transfer in solid state applications.  IUCRC CEPS will provide solutions for safe, high efficiency, and eco-friendly sustainable energy storage leading to energy security, stronger national defense, and advancements in the interests of national health.  The role of the SDSMT center is to develop the next generation of solid-state energy storage architectures through a fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships.  The SDSMT center effort is focused on alternative solid-state deposition approaches that will provide a cutting edge strategy for manufacturing of solid-state energy storage devices. The faculty associated with SDSMT center will advance the NSF mission of diversity by mentoring young scientists and minority students, and providing broad multidisciplinary educational experience. \r\n\r\nThe prospective Center focuses on advancing understanding of fundamental mechanisms that take place in novel superfast solid-state glass-ceramic conductors under electric transient conditions and correlation of these mechanisms with the corresponding transport mechanisms for high efficiency, safe, and environmentally friendly all-solid-state energy technology.  New knowledge and scientific contributions to the field of solid-state ionics will be generated through the following: 1) Mechanisms of micro- and nanostructural evolution of novel nano-architectures at atomic scale; 2) Understanding mass and charge transfer mechanisms by in-situ operando studies; 3) Self-charging mechanisms within intrinsically integrated solid-state energy storage multilayer structures involving perovskite solar cells; 4) New miniaturization technology leading to safe, human-friendly, and long-lasting solid-state energy storage systems for medical applications; and 5) Solid-state energy storage integration into green power generation systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
