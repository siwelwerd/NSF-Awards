 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Cameron Gokee (Appalachian State University) will lead archaeological research to study the impact of the Atlantic slave trade on village communities in West Africa. Historical sources, which are few in number, describe how these communities fought or fled slave raiders, but a key question remains unanswered - how did these strategies transform political, economic, and cultural relations among societies on the edge of the Atlantic world? Archaeology is well-placed to answer this question by examining evidence for changing social relations within and between village communities before, during, and after the rise of the Atlantic slave trade in the 17-18th centuries. Most broadly, this research will cast new light on the historical causes and consequences of a violent social rupture shared by both Africans and the African Diaspora in the Americas. More specifically, it will foster innovative research opportunities for university students and public outreach collaborations with local communities, including the installation of  a museum exhibit at a UNESCO world heritage cultural center in the region. By exploring local responses to global processes over the long-term, this research can also inform forward-looking approaches to US political and economic engagement in rural Africa and other regions on the periphery of the modern world system. \r\n\r\nDr. Gokee and his research team will examine how the Atlantic slave trade impacted social life in a West African \"hatter zone\" - a region where people fought, fled, and/or joined the predatory political economies of neighboring states. Focusing on the Bandafassi region of eastern Senegal, this project will identify the social rules of of inclusion and exclusion that defined who could be enslaved by whom, and under what conditions, over the past several centuries. Researchers will identify these patterns through landscape survey and detailed mapping of past village sites, including riverside locales associated with merchants and militias and highland settlements associated with the people avoiding them. Analyses of the artifacts from these sites, including a microscopic study of pottery, will document how economic processes of production and exchange also shaped the social relations within and between different village communities. The specialized collection and luminescence dating of pottery samples will then reveal how the village societies of Bandafassi did or did not change over time, particularly in response to the Atlantic slave trade in the 17-18th centuries. These methods will generate new data for better modelling how global forces impact local communities in shatter zones past and present, while also providing novel opportunities for public outreach and student education and research in the US and Senegal.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

First, the BRAP team, including faculty and students from the US, Senegal, and Guinea, surveyed nearly 46 km2 to record 355 archaeological sites, including camps, iron furnaces, and settlements representing past landscape use from the Stone Age to the early-twentieth century. For the 96 settlement sites, we also collected surface artifacts (e.g., pottery sherds, glass beads, gunflints) and mapped visible architectural features (e.g., hut foundations) to interpret the socio-economic relations among neighboring households. Second, our team undertook test excavations to chart the histories of five villages in the BRAP study area, and to develop a regional chronology based on 29 radiocarbon and OSL/TL dates from buried sediments and pottery sherds. Finally, we initiated macroscopic and microscopic analyses for thousands of artifacts found during survey and excavation to explore how local economic activities (e.g., cooking, crafting, trading) and social identities (e.g., ethnicity, class) responded to the Atlantic and interior slave trades.<span> </span></p>\n<p>Our results illustrate key changes and continuities in village communities as southeastern Senegal developed into a shatter zone over the past millennium. From AD 1000-1400, this region was home to diverse agro-pastoral families dispersed among small homesteads, where they sometimes made pots and smelted iron for blacksmithing. From AD 1400-1700, many of these families assembled into large villages on the Bandafassi plateau for defense against raiding by neighboring states, while others settled into market villages on the Gambia River for trade with these same states. In both cases, village life in this emerging shatter zone involved new forms of leadership and greater emphasis on ethnic and religious identities.

Second, our methods illustrate new ways to the study the impact of slave-raiding on small-scale societies, where political instability often increases regional mobility and reduces visibility in the archaeological record. These results will inform future research on shatter zone dynamics in and beyond West Africa--anywhere the absence of deeply stratified sites has been an obstacle for studying long-term social change and continuity.</p>\n<p>This project has made broader impacts through public outreach activities and research opportunities in Senegal and the US.

We then developed a mobile exhibition for presentation to village communities across the Bandafassi region, including adults and primary school children. The final presentation took place at the Bandafassi Cultural Center where the exhibition will now remain on display for community members and tourists. These outreach activities, together with fieldwork, involved training three American and ten Senegalese graduate students in diverse excavation and survey methods. Meanwhile, online exhibition design and artifact analyses at Appalachian State University provided opportunities for six students at a public university in the rural South to collaborate on international research and gain practical skills for their careers in archaeology and public history.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/29/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Cameron&nbsp;D&nbsp;Gokee</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1842204/1842204_10598801_1693333120923_Image03_ExcavationBRAP_2019--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1842204/1842204_10598801_1693333120923_Image03_ExcavationBRAP_2019--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"03 -
