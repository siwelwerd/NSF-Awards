 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recurrent flooding, which is flooding that occurs repeatedly related to precipitation events, high tides and storm surge, is increasing in coastal areas.  Although characterized as a temporary nuisance it may result in cumulative local economic losses to both residents and businesses.  This project will conduct a workshop which will identify research questions related to the impact of and responses to recurrent flooding in a coastal region.  The workshop is designed to broaden participation across sectors, to include community stakeholders, researchers, decision makers, and practitioners, and will allow for new and diverse perspectives and co-production of knowledge that can advance awareness of existing adaptation behaviors, potential adaptive response strategies, and real-world constraints faced by vulnerable populations and communities.   By 2020 it is estimated that 47 percent of the United States population will be living along coastlines, this workshop will provide the main societal benefit of advancing inclusive, collaborative adaptation opportunities which are needed to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare.  \r\n\r\nThe workshop focus is recurrent flooding, linking natural systems and population-based systems, in the Hampton Roads urban environment. The workshop approach is designed specifically to develop research questions within five themed-topic areas of manage coastal flooding, safeguard vulnerable populations, protect and sustain economic vitality, promote and enhance public health, and increase adaptive capacity, and frame these within the context of longer-term dynamics that facilitate the migration of human and economic activities away from risk.  The 2-day workshop includes plenary and thematic information sessions, five thematic charrette sessions and a roundtable session, followed by a researcher work session for synthesis of research topics, which will result in a prescriptive-based white paper that identifies high priority research topics for coastal environments and natural hazards in populated coastal regions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
