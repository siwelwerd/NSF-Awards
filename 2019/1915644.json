 "awd_abstract_narration": "This multi-institutional project aims to serve the national interest by improving college writing instruction and the technical writing abilities of engineering students. Although writing is a critical skill for engineers, employers frequently complain that engineering graduates need better writing skills.  Undergraduate engineering curricula typically require various general education writing courses early in the program of study. However, engineering educators often do not have the tools to connect students' learning from early writing courses to their writing in engineering courses. The goal of this project is to improve the transfer of writing skills from college writing courses into engineering courses.  To accomplish this goal, the project will develop an instructional module to facilitate transfer of writing skills from writing courses into the laboratory component of engineering courses.  It will also evaluate whether the instructional module enhances student writing of engineering lab reports. This project expands on a previous project that demonstrated success in this approach at one institution.  In this follow-on study, the writing module will be further refined and implemented at multiple institutions.  The partnering institutions were chosen because of differences in the general education writing course requirements for their engineering students.  Thus, this research study could identify writing instruction strategies that are transferable across different types of institutions.  \r\n\r\nThis Engaged Student Learning project will identify what transferable knowledge students bring from three far-transfer models: concurrent transfer in which students build on first year composition and technical writing courses; vertical transfer in which students have only completed first year composition; and absent transfer in which students have completed a literary course but lack both technical writing and the preparation in composition that is characteristic of first year composition. The collaboration includes at least one institution representing each of the three models, enabling exploration of two key research questions: \"How can writing transfer be adapted across the US to a wide range of writing curricula in lower-division courses?\" and \"How can a transfer-focused writing module be implemented effectively in diverse engineering lab classrooms taught by any instructor?\" Informed by a mapping of students' collective zone of proximal development, a lab report instructional module will be refined by adapting multiple scaffolds to support students' incremental engagement with lab report writing as engaged disciplinary learning. The module will include direct instructional materials and reference materials as supports for writing lab reports. The project will conduct quantitative and qualitative assessment of students' lab report writing as disciplinary meaning making, as well as students' development of technical communication skills. Results from this integrated mixed methods approach has the potential to advance knowledge about the impact of transfer-focused writing pedagogies on students' lab report writing competencies. This project is based on results from an exploratory project that showed statistically significant improvements in engineering students' lab report quality after implementing a writing transfer-focused lab report module at two institutions utilizing a vertical transfer model. These results suggest that a student-centered pedagogical approach that explicitly reinforces writing knowledge and skills from prior post-secondary writing experiences can be more productive than the traditional case study approach often employed in engineering writing instruction. With these encouraging prior results, the results of this project have the potential to be applicable to diverse engineering laboratory course settings across diverse engineering curricula.  This project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources.  This program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project investigated the impact of different writing preparations on students' lab writing outcomes, developed instructional modules using a scaffolding approach, and assessed the effectiveness of these efforts on students and instructors across various engineering lab course disciplines. The project sought to enhance students' technical communication skills by providing scaffolded instructional modules for students and dedicated writing guidance for lab instructors, teaching assistants (TAs), and students; these Engineering Lab Writing Guides are now available at engineeringlabwriting.org.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project's investigation into the transfer of writing knowledge revealed critical insights into how engineering students from three different institutions approach lab report writing. Each institution represented a common writing preparation curricular model: a first-year composition course followed by introductory engineering lab-report writing courses (vertical), a technical writing course taken at the same time as introductory engineering lab-report writing courses (concurrent), and no required writing course prior to or taking introductory engineering lab-report writing courses (absent). Students from these models showed varying levels of preparedness, with concurrent transfer students displaying a higher proficiency in areas such as lab data analysis. The research highlighted that while lab report conventions were often transferred automatically, more complex skills, such as rhetorical awareness and data interpretation, required targeted instruction. Building on these findings, we developed structured instructional modules for instructors and TAs tailored to promote students' writing transfer by using shared language to describe and reinforce foundational writing terms (e.g., audience, claim, critical thinking, evidence, source). These terms, commonly used by writing faculty, were repackaged for immediate use by engineering faculty who are not necessarily versed in foundational writing instruction. We also added a 'Writing with AI' module to cover the issues related to generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project developed 13 transfer-focused instructional modules for students using a scaffolding approach: A Student's Guide to Engineering Lab Writing. The guide covers foundational to advanced writing skills, such as building the IMRDC (introduction, methods, results, discussion, conclusion) structure, analyzing lab data, and presenting results effectively to the technical audience. The guide was continuously updated based on a community-of-practice approach, incorporating feedback from participating students, TAs, and instructors to ensure effectiveness. The guide was tested in more than ten lab courses in civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering programs across four institutions, including a 2-year institution. The results showed that students (n = 42) who participated in lab courses where the guide was implemented outperformed the control group (n = 64) in lab courses before implementation. The areas improved by the guide implementation included audience awareness, data presentation, and data interpretation. These findings suggest that implementing the modules improved students' writing skills and enhanced their disciplinary learning in engineering labs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project's broader impact extended beyond engineering students, supporting transfer-focused writing pedagogies for instructors and TAs through professional development workshops offered in 2022 and 2023. These workshops equipped over 20 educators across multiple institutions using the Instructor's Guide to Engineering Lab Writing to improve lab report writing pedagogy, creating a community of practice around engineering writing education. The online dissemination of the instructional modules (at engineeringlabwriting.org) further broadened the project's reach, offering scalable resources to support both engineering students and lab educators nationwide. The site visitors are over a million until the end of the project period, and the trajectory is going upward. We hosted a Sunday Workshop at the 2024 ASEE Annual Conference to disseminate the modules to 30 engineering educators across the nation. We also offered outreach workshops in hands-on engineering experiments with writing activities for pre-college underrepresented groups by partnering with Math Engineering Science Achievement (MESA).&nbsp;The generated new knowledge about writing transfer, writing pedagogies, writing with AI, and community of practice in engineering writing has been disseminated in two peer-reviewed journals, 15 peer-reviewed conference papers, and six presentations at national conferences, including both engineering and writing studies venues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In summary, this five-year project successfully achieved its goals of identifying gaps in writing transfer, developing open-source instructional modules available freely online, and fostering improvements in both student learning and instructors' teaching practices in introductory engineering labs. The scaffolded modules and professional development efforts have significantly impacted how engineering lab report writing is taught and evaluated, providing long-term benefits to students, instructors, and the engineering education community.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 09/30/2024<br>\nModified by: Dave&nbsp;Kim</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1915644/1915644_10615816_1727526161163_Guide3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1915644/1915644_10615816_1727526161163_Guide3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"A Student's Guide to Engineering Lab Writing\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1915644/1915644_10615816_1727526161163_Guide3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"A Student's Guide to Engineering Lab Writing\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The cover page of the instructional modules prepared for students to enhance their writing in engineering labs.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">N/A</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dave&nbsp;Kim\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">A Student's Guide to Engineering Lab Writing</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1915644/1915644_10615816_1727526037025_Guide2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1915644/1915644_10615816_1727526037025_Guide2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"An Instructor's Guide to Engineering Lab Writing\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1915644/1915644_10615816_1727526037025_Guide2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"An Instructor's Guide to Engineering Lab Writing\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The cover page of the instructional modules prepared for engineering lab instructors and teaching assistants to support lab report writing pedagogy</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">N/A</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dave&nbsp;Kim\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">An Instructor's Guide to Engineering Lab Writing</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1915644/1915644_10615816_1727525855942_Guide1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1915644/1915644_10615816_1727525855942_Guide1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Engineering Lab Writing Guides - cover page\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1915644/1915644_10615816_1727525855942_Guide1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Engineering Lab Writing Guides - cover page\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The cover page of the Engineering Lab Writing Guides, providing scaffolded instructional modules for students and dedicated writing guidance for lab instructors and teaching assistants (TAs)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">N/A</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Dave&nbsp;Kim\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Engineering Lab Writing Guides - cover page</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
