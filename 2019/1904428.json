 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Summary:\r\n\r\nMaterial objects with dimensions on the micrometer or nanometer length scales can exhibit much higher strength than macroscopic objects. To realize the exciting new opportunities offered by such objects, it is necessary to understand the laws of plasticity, or material deformation, in defect-free nano-scale systems. Such laws are largely unknown and are likely to be different from those in macroscopic metals. The US and Israeli Principal Investigators will conduct a collaborative research program that tightly integrates experiments and computer modeling to achieve a deeper fundamental understanding of the laws and mechanisms of plasticity in nano-scale metals and alloys. This research will create a theoretical framework for the design of new nano-scale materials combining the highest-possible mechanical strength with other service characteristics. This research will impact many areas of science and technology where mechanical strength is one of the goals of materials design. The Principal Investigators will disseminate the results of this project through presentations at interdisciplinary meetings, publishing overview articles, and by organizing workshops/symposia on broad topics emphasizing nano-scale phenomena across disciplines. This will include a series of US-Israel nano-mechanics workshops with broad international participation. To reach out to broader communities, significant efforts will be put in popularizing this research using online scientific news outlets. The US Investigator and the students will visit local (Fairfax Co.) high schools to give popular presentations including examples of nano-scale phenomena and their impact on modern technology.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary:\r\n\r\nThe US and Israeli Principal Investigators (PIs) propose a collaborative research program that tightly integrates experiments and computer modeling to achieve a deeper fundamental understanding of the laws and mechanisms of nucleation-controlled plasticity in nano-scale metals and alloys. The research will be focused on Ni and several Ni-based alloys strategically chosen to probe some of the key factors that can impact the particle strength. Such factors will include the particle size and shape, the surface oxidation state, the chemical composition of the alloy, the long-range order, and the phase transformations. This research will create a theoretical framework for the design of new nano-scale materials combining the highest-possible mechanical strength with other service characteristics. The PIs will disseminate the results of this project through presentations at interdisciplinary meetings, publishing overview articles, and by organizing workshops/symposia on broad topics emphasizing nano-scale phenomena across disciplines. This will include a series of US-Israel nano-mechanics workshops with broad international participation. To reach out to broader communities, significant efforts will be put in popularizing this research using online scientific news outlets. The US PI and the students will visit local (Fairfax Co.) high schools to give popular presentations including examples of nano-scale phenomena and their impact on modern technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
