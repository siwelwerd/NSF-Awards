 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data science is becoming increasingly relevant in the workplace and everyday life; therefore, there is a need for students to have opportunities to work with data and view data science as inviting and feasible. This project will focus on the integration of computer science and mathematics through data science in after-school data-science clubs and camps in rural and urban settings with middle school youth. The project will create modules for teaching and learning data science that can be shared with educators in informal and formal settings. The modules will engage youth in conducting their own data investigations using computer tools for engaging with large and small data sets. Data science education is a new field and the project will contribute to developing knowledge about how to best teach data science and how to create effective learning environments for students. The project is funded by the STEM+Computing program, which seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within disciplinary STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (preK-12).\r\n\r\nThe project will use a design-based research framework to develop, test, and revise the learning modules in urban and rural settings. The data science concepts include variability in data, organizing data, data structure, data representations, and statistical reasoning. These concepts are connected to both mathematics and computer science concepts. The project seeks to develop knowledge about how to design learning environments for students to learn data science using computational tools.  The research questions include examining the design of the units and students' learning about data science concepts. The data to be collected include interviews with students, observations from the after-school clubs and camps, and students' work from the modules. Educators who lead the learning experiences will also provide feedback to inform revision and implementation.",

Our goal in that context was to design and study a model for introducing both urban and rural middle school students to the basics of data science. Over the course of the project, we developed three, 10-hour out-of-school modules in which students use the Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP, <a title=\"CODAP link\" href=\"https://codap.concord.org/\" target=\"_blank\">codap.concord.org</a>) to explore complex data on topics we chose for this particular audience. The three modules focus on the following topics: teens' use of social media; Lyme and other tick-borne diseases; and injuries due to sports and other leisure activities. The modules are available to request for free from our website: <a title=\"Data Clubs website link\" href=\"http://www.terc.edu/dataclubs\" target=\"_blank\">terc.edu/dataclubs</a>. We also created a professional development workshop for teachers to support them in finding and integrating data into their science, math, and engineering classes.</p>\n<p>Below are some of the most important things we have learned in exploring our model, which we hope will be useful guidelines for future projects.</p>\n<p>Students are generally not motivated by \"data\" per se, but by the topics the data allow them to investigate and/or what data empower them to do. Middle school students are highly interested in social issues and questions of fairness and inequity, as well as in themes that are relevant to their own world (such as health concerns).</p>\n<p>Students appreciate the opportunity to ask their own questions of data. To facilitate this, it is important to provide datasets with multiple related variables. It is also helpful in curating datasets to make sure there are interesting discoveries for students to make when they explore the data.</p>\n<p>Because we focused first on the topics of our modules, rather than on particular statistical concepts, the statistical ideas introduced in each module emerged from the structure of the datasets we used. This situation led us to an unanticipated focus in our research. Many datasets that youth might find interesting include a large number of categorical variables; in particular, our module on sports and leisure injuries used a dataset where the majority of variables are categorical. Observing students who engaged with this module led us to study how they analyzed relationships between two categorical variables, a notoriously tricky topic, as it requires proportional reasoning with changing \"wholes.\" The Common Core Math Standards and the Next Generation Science Standards encourage this kind of reasoning, though it is not a focus of school curricula. Thus, our results have the potential to move the field forward.</p>\n<p>Teachers are eager to integrate data into their classes, but do not have the resources available to support them in finding and preparing appropriate datasets. Our project helped teachers find and wrangle datasets that were customized for their particular course needs. This issue is beginning to be recognized more widely in the data science education field, but there is still no general solution. Our approach of pairing a data scientist with a teacher to find and customize datasets worked well, but a more scalable approach is needed.</p>\n<p>While it can be useful for students to collect their own data, using large, publicly available datasets provides rich context and analytical opportunities that are difficult to achieve with student-collected data. However, it is critical when using these data sources to query the provenance of the data and consider how, when, where, why, and from whom the data were collected. These details have significant implications for the types of questions that can be asked and inferences that can be drawn from any dataset.</p>\n<p>Just as it is important to help students and teachers find good datasets, it is critical that they have accessible data tools. Our participants found CODAP easy to use; they were able to create graphs and maps with only a very short orientation to the software. Learning how and when to do more complex \"data moves,\" however, is more challenging.</p>\n<p>Interpreting data representations is also a challenge for students. In an out-of-school program with limited time, students can learn to interpret graphs showing distributions of one variable, either numerical or categorical, and to read graphs of a variable changing over time. Throughout our program, students also interpreted multiple bivariate graphs, a task that was largely unfamiliar to them. This is an important area for school mathematics to focus on.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/31/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Janice&nbsp;Mokros</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1917653/1917653_10520829_1667228483178_2019-05-0615.06.44copy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1917653/1917653_10520829_1667228483178_2019-05-0615.06.44copy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CODAP data exploration\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1917653/1917653_10520829_1667228483178_2019-05-0615.06.44copy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CODAP data exploration\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A Data Clubs student explores data in CODAP, a free online data tool.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Data Clubs</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Janice&nbsp;Mokros</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CODAP data exploration</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1917653/1917653_10520829_1667228128533_IMG_0274--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1917653/1917653_10520829_1667228128533_IMG_0274--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ticks and Lyme state cards\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1917653/1917653_10520829_1667228128533_IMG_0274--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ticks and Lyme state cards\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two students explore state case cards for rates of Lyme disease around the US as part of the Ticks and Lyme module.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Data Clubs</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Janice&nbsp;Mokros</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ticks and Lyme state cards</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1917653/1917653_10520829_1667228735966_IMG_9410--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1917653/1917653_10520829_1667228735966_IMG_9410--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ticks CODAP exploration\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1917653/1917653_10520829_1667228735966_IMG_9410--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ticks CODAP exploration\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Pairs of students in the Ticks and Lyme module begin to learn how to use CODAP, a free online data tool, using physical \"CODAP challenge cards\" to support their learning.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Data Clubs</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Janice&nbsp;Mokros</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ticks CODAP exploration</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
