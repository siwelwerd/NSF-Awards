 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important problems of space plasma physics is understanding how high-energy charged particles are generated. There are a huge variety of mechanisms suggested for accelerating electrons in the region of the geomagnetic field known as the current sheet. This project will help distinguish between these theories to help determine which are at work in the magnetosphere. This is directly relevant to the National Space Weather Plan, since the work can lead to better models and forecasts of space weather, which affects national commercial and defense satellites and space-based communications. Additionally, graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the research.\r\n\r\nThis project quantifies the impact of the electron thermal anisotropy on the magnetotail current sheet structure and investigates the variation of characteristics of electron thermal anisotropy with geomagnetic activity. The anisotropic electron population can be responsible for generation of strong currents (induced by particle curvature drifts) and can serve as an energy source for various electromagnetic wave emissions. The project uses observations from five spacecraft missions (Geotail, Cluster, THEMIS, ARTEMIS, and MMS) covering the entire magnetotail within the radial distances from 10 to 80 Earth radii downtail. Using several years of THEMIS/ARTEMIS observations in the near-Earth and middle magnetotail, the work studies both the radial distribution of the electron thermal anisotropy and the impact of electron anisotropic currents on current sheet structure for different magnetotail configurations. Moreover, using MMS observations with the high-resolution plasma measurements the work will for the first time statistically reveal the fine structure of the electron anisotropic population and its contribution to the current density.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
