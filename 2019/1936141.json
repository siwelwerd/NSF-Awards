 "awd_abstract_narration": "An NSF ADVANCE Adaptation grant will support the creation of a supportive campus community for STEM faculty at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE).  SIUE is a doctoral and professional university with over 13,000 students. The project will implement three components: recruitment and hiring: Progressive Recruitment Initiatives Mark Excellence (PRIME); improving departmental climate and support for female faculty Keeping Educators through Equity Programming (KEEP); and mitigating bias in the tenure and promotion review processes University Promotion (UP).  This project builds on work from a previous ADVANCE IT-Catalyst grant which resulted in some changes at SIUE such as stop the tenure clock and family leave policies.  This project will target persistent issues with climate and culture at SIUE.  \r\n\r\nSIUE will implement projects to enable search committees to conduct better searches with equity advisors, create an advocates and allies program, create dean and department chair toolkits and implement equity scorecards, train tenure and promotion committees on un-conscious bias, coordinate with dual career staff, and create leadership opportunities for STEM faculty.  The Adaptation project aligns with and supports the institutional strategic plan and mission of the institution.  SIUE anticipates that the ADVANCE Adaptation project will result in changes in the culture and climate of the organization which will enhance the recruitment, retention, promotion and success of all STEM faculty.\r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.  ADVANCE \"Adaptation\" awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based strategies to academic, non-profit institution of higher education as well as non-academic, non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Programs to recruit, retain, and promote diverse women faculty in science, technology, engineering, math, and the social and behavioral sciences (STEM/SBS) from previous successful ADVANCE programs were adapted for Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, a doctoral/professional university located in the Midwest.  Six key initiatives will be sustained past the grant funding:  (1) equity advisors for search committees; (2) an online Chair Toolkit that contains resources related to department climate, faculty hiring, and faculty evaluation; (3) an equity scorecard for dean accountability; (4) an Advocates and Allies group of men faculty; (5) additional mentoring support for early career faculty through the Growth Network program; (6) additional professional development for mid-career faculty.  \nThe equity advisors have been trained to reduce bias in the search and hiring process.  The program has been expanded beyond faculty searches to include staff and administrator searches.  The program is now overseen by the Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.  \nIn addition to other resources, the Chair Toolkit includes a list of important questions for reviewing tenure and promotion requirements for bias.  The questions were piloted to provide feedback to two departments and two schools, which resulted in positive responses from recipients and the incorporation of some of the recommendations already by one school.  The Toolkit was highlighted in three publications targeting department chairs to be published in 2024 and available in pre-print in the SIUE repository.  \nThe equity scorecard provides a method for deans to reflect on and report to the Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs how they will encourage the use of relevant resources to increase the diversity of faculty and support those faculty.  \nTwo engaged faculty are leading the Advocates and Allies in learning how they can reduce bias and support diverse faculty across the University.  \nWith support from the Provost?s Office, the Center for Faculty Development and Innovation is overseeing the mentoring and professional development programs. \nThe initiatives and results were shared through 57 presentations and workshops, one thesis, four publications, and four brochures and flyers.  Relevant resources were also added to the ARC Network Online Resource Library and are included on the project website.\n \nThe combination of initiatives empowers individuals, departments, and schools to enhance equity and promote a supportive and inclusive gender climate across the University. Together these collaborative initiatives provide a comprehensive approach that are expected to result in long-term diverse applicant hires, improved retention and promotion of diverse women STEM/SBS faculty, and, ultimately, stronger academic programs that retain and graduate more diverse students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Susan M Morgan"
