 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Consortium on Ocean Leadership (COL) will host a workshop to focus on the issues surrounding the representation of women in tenure-track and tenured faculty positions in the ocean sciences. Given the percentage of women receiving doctorates in ocean sciences for the last two decades, the number of women in these faculty positions in the ocean sciences is lower than expected.  The workshop will invite representatives of academic institutions to review and discuss the available data on the representation of women at various levels in the ocean science doctorate-to-tenured-faculty pipeline, to consider the factors that influence women's experiences and decisions related to academic careers, and to determine if further investigation into these factors is needed. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will be held at COL headquarters in Washington, DC with about twenty-two participants in late 2019. As a deliverable for this workshop, COL will provide an analysis of available data on the representation of women in the ocean sciences workforce, and results of the data analysis and recommendations from the workshop will be published in a major oceanographic journal. This workshop will support NSF goals of ensuring a diverse scientific workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
