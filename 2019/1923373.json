The project will gain insight into the obstacles to CS education faced by high school students living regions such as Appalachia with high rates of poverty, and it will develop a comprehensive program to prepare and support their teachers in teaching an AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) course.\r\n\r\nCS4App will develop a Networked Improvement Community (NIC) partnering AppState faculty and regional teachers with an interest in offering CSP at their school. The Friday Institute will deliver an effective blend of research-based teacher professional development (PD) including a 4-week, intensive training in the summer and continued interactions during the school year. The PD will introduce CS technical and pedagogical content, as well as leadership development, inquiry-based instruction, and student equity issues.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
