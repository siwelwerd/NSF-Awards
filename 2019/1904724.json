 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support meetings of the Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar (PNGS) to be held at the University of British Columbia, the University of Washington, the University of Oregon, Oregon State University, Portland State University, and Lewis & Clark College, beginning in Spring 2019. PNGS meetings generally feature six invited research talks by leading experts in differential geometry and geometrical analysis. The meetings also include discussion sessions in which the speakers and participants assess the state of various areas in geometry and highlight open problems in these areas.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of very active researchers in geometry scattered throughout the various colleges and universities involved in the Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar. PNGS meetings will bring these researchers together for consultation, collaboration, and stimulation of new ideas. A significant number of research programs have been initiated as a result of interactions at past meetings. The PNGS series is especially valuable for graduate students in geometry at the participating universities which have small geometry groups. PNGS meetings give these students an excellent opportunity to see the broader picture of research in geometry. The meetings are also very valuable for the growing number of geometers working at some of the smaller universities in the region, such as Pacific University, Seattle University, and Idaho State University. More information can be found on the conference website: www.math.washington.edu/~lee/PNGS\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
