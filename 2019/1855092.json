 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much about the early evolution of life on earth still remains a mystery, and while advances have been made in recent decades, major questions remain, especially about the relationships between biology and the rise of oxygen in the earth's atmosphere. Our proposal will measure organic carbon isotopes of microscopic fossils that represent our best window into the evolution of life before the rise of animals. These measurements will help us figure out where in the oceans early organisms were living and if early life could thrive in waters with little to no oxygen. This work will involve undergraduate students in every aspect of the research, analysis, and writing. We will create new geochemical and paleontological educational modules for K-12 and college educators, develop innovative organic geochemistry techniques that will be shared with the broader scientific community and add information on early fossil life to the open-access Paleobiology Database. \r\n\r\nWhile we have learned a significant amount about the Proterozoic Earth system in the last few decades, major questions remain, especially about the interplay between biology and the rise of atmospheric oxygen. One window into the biological record of the Proterozoic is via organic carbon isotopes, which track the isotope systematics of fixed carbon. However, these measurements are almost always done on bulk samples that represent the entire biological community time averaged into a sedimentary sample, which limits our ability to use these measurements to reconstruct short-term carbon cycle dynamics and to probe the structure of ancient ecosystems. Recent advances in NanoEA-IRMS now allow us to reliably measure the carbon isotopic composition of a single organic microfossil and compare that value to the bulk 13C. We seek to use this new technique to explore how organic carbon isotopes can illuminate two persistent unknowns in the Proterozoic Earth-life system: 1) What were the habitats and metabolisms of early eukaryotes? and 2) What can single microfossil carbon isotopes reveal about the controls on bulk carbon isotopes in the Proterozoic stratigraphic record and what do these records tell us about the Proterozoic Earth system?. We will approach these questions by analyzing bulk, kerogen and fossil organic carbon samples from four richly fossiliferous units that span the history of Proterozoic eukaryotes. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this proposal include continued development and refining of stable isotope analysis techniques, and integration of the Proterozoic microfossil record into the open-access Paleobiology Database. The proposal team will involve undergraduate students in all aspects of the research, and undergraduates will be meaningfully involved in data collection and interpretation. The team will also develop new educational activities for both high school and college-level audiences. The proposed work will include a postdoctoral fellow who will be mentored by all three PI's on research, professional development, and teaching.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Often the affinities and ecology of these organisms are not known, making it difficult to decipher how the evolution of Earth&rsquo;s environments influenced the evolution of life. The primary focus of this grant was to apply a newly developed tool for measuring the carbon isotope ratios of individual microfossils to Precambrian organic-walled microfossils to infer whey they lived in the water column. (Carbon isotope ratios often become lighter with depth, reflecting the processes of photosynthesis in surface layers and organic matter degradation in deeper waters, and therefore we hypothesized that we might see differences in the C isotope ratios of planktonic vs. benthic taxa.) We focused our efforts on the richly fossiliferous strata of the &lt;770 to 730 million-year-old Chuar Group, located in the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. We found that, as predicted, species thought to planktonic on the basis of fossil morphology showed heavier values while species thought to be benthic (e.g. mat-building filamentous or sheet-like forms) showed lighter values. We extended this work to older units (the 1 billion-year-old Bylot Supergroup in Canada and the 1.6 billion-year-old Changcheng Group in China) and found similar patterns wherein mat-building forms were consistently lighter than the other species in the assemblage. In addition&ndash;and to our surprise&ndash;we found that the average isotope ratios of fossils in the Chuar Group remained more or or less invariant throughout the 40-million year interval, despite wide swings (positive excursions of +10 per mil) in carbon isotope ratios measured on bulk organic carbon isolated from the same rocks. Based on our measurements of the individual components of the organic matter in each sample, we propose that different factors contributed to the different positive excursions. In one case, the delivery of very enriched older (perhaps older- rock-derived) organic carbon appeared to drive the positive excursion; in the other case we proposed that blooms of bacteria&mdash;preserved as abundant ~1 &micro;m ellipsoidal fossils&ndash;drove the excursions in bulk organic matter.
