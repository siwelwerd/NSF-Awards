 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum simulators (emulators) are used to simulate computationally complex and experimentally inaccessible problems using a controllable quantum system. Such a simulator is a task-specific device that mimics the physical behavior of a system of interest that is computationally hard to model or experimentally difficult to realize. Different platforms for simulators, such as cold atoms in an optical lattice, quantum nanostructures, superconducting circuits, and defects in diamond, have been proposed and some partially realized. Under this research program the team will take a distinct approach based on half-light half-matter quasiparticles (a.k.a. exciton-polaritons) as a \"programmable quantum matter\" platform to realize chip-scale quantum emulators. Specifically, the researchers will use organic molecular systems combined with light-trapping structures to simulate systems ranging from magnetism to electron transport in quasicrystals. This architecture, which relies on the latest advances in photonics and solid-states physics, can also be leveraged to solve diverse computationally intractable problems from protein folding and neural networks to the dynamics of financial markets. The program will help train a cadre of graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral associates in the broad area of quantum technologies. The program will also benefit from strong international partnerships. Outreach efforts will focus on developing a high school curriculum to introduce concepts of quantum technologies and public events targeted at making the public aware of quantum technologies.  \r\n\r\nQuantum emulators leverage the control of interacting degrees of freedom to simulate complex quantum phases of matter arising in many-body systems that are outside the reach of classical computers. Through this research program the team aims to develop a chip-scale quantum emulator platform based on lattices of exciton-polaritons (strongly coupled half-light half-matter quasiparticles). This platform for analog quantum emulation will exploit exciton-polariton condensates in lattices, an alternative to more widespread atom-lattice approaches. Owing to their hybrid character, the photon component lends the system small mass, coherence, and ability to engineer the potential energy landscape, while the matter component provides the necessary nonlinearity and interactions that can be controlled on demand. The research program will use excitons in organic molecular systems as the material component, which presents unique advantages such as elevated operational temperature, tunability, and the possibility to engineer the optical properties through molecular design.  Through careful engineering of the photonic band structure, polariton lattices with complex band-structures will be realized. Additionally, exciton polariton condensates, being intrinsically a driven dissipative system, present an ideal platform to emulate and uncover out-of-equilibrium quantum orders. Specific program goals include the demonstration of exciton polariton condensate lattices with controlled interactions to simulate: (i) ferromagnetism and anti-ferromagnetism in a one-dimensional polariton lattice, (ii) disorder protected non-equilibrium quantum orders in quasiperiodic lattices, and (iii) topologically protected states in two-dimensional lattices with engineered chiral symmetries.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Quantum Leap Big Idea Program and the Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
