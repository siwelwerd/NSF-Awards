 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Instrumentation Programs. Professor Christopher Hartley from Miami University in Ohio and colleagues Michael Crowder, Meredith Erb, Dominik Konkolewicz and Wei Liu are acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with flow monitoring accessory to monitor kinetics and an automatic sampler. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as facilitating studies of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The NMR studies improve understanding of synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research. This broadly accessible instrumentation strengthens the regional NMR analytical infrastructure and help advance the scientific careers of many regular users of undergraduate and graduate researchers and postdocs. The spectrometer enriches the education and training experience of underrepresented undergraduate students in several NSF supported science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs and several hundred undergraduate students in chemistry and biochemistry laboratory classes at this institution.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The spectrometer is especially useful for studying o-phenylene foldamers and non-equilibrium systems and for monitoring flurorination reactions. It is also essential or studying kinetics of polymerization and small-molecule reactions and metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes. The spectrometer aids researchers exploring coordination compounds of high-spin cobalt(II) and those studying enantioselective catalysis. It is also in exploration of heterogeneous electrocatalysis of carbon dioxide and methane.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
