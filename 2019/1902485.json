The conference is expected to attract around 120 participants. The conference proceedings will be published in a special issue of the International Journal of Number Theory.\r\nThis conference will bring together prominent national and international figures to discuss current research trends and recent advances in combinatorial and analytic number theory, and for collaborative research discussions. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe invited speakers represent a broad range of topics including algebraic combinatorics, representation theory, special functions,modular  and other automorphic forms, partition theory, symbolic computation, L-functions and many others. In addition we will have many contributed talks on diverse areas of number theory. More details are available at the conference website: https://math.illinois.edu/nt2019\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
