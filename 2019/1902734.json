These two families of disordered systems have broad mathematical interest and are relevant in a variety of other disciplines, including experimental physics, machine learning, and network theory.\n\nMajor outcomes include:\n\nA new variational formula for the time constant in first-passage percolation.  This formula led to an affirmative answer to an open problem regarding convergence of the empirical measures of edge-weights witnessed along geodesics.\n(joint work with Y.
