 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"How well did I sleep last night? How relaxed am I right now? Will I feel better or worse tomorrow?\"  These questions are increasingly answerable with personal data collected through fitness trackers and other sensors. Many of the tools that enable this kind of self knowledge rely on visualizations of the data to help users make sense of it. Choices made in the design of these visualizations typically focus on how data are displayed, which data are given priority, and how different types of data will be compared. All of these decisions impact how self-knowledge is created and supported by personal data tools. For populations with complex social identities (such as people experiencing serious mental illness or members of marginalized communities), visual conventions applied to personal data often carry problematic assumptions regarding what is \"normal\" and what \"progress\" looks like.  For example, common data science techniques for visually representing data such as statistical smoothing, normative baselines, and continuous temporal models often do not match well with the lived day-to-day experiences of people with mood or cognitive disorders who self-track as a form of therapy. This project will develop design methods and recommendations for personal data visualizations that better match unique needs of people's identities.  The work will also result in non-discriminatory data visualization practices, teaching materials, and professional resources for more reflective approaches to the design of personal data visualizations. \r\n\r\nThis research and related educational activities will focus on the visual encoding of personal data for populations particularly vulnerable to discriminatory and biased technology. Empirical design research will engage two vulnerable groups: 1) transgender and gender nonconforming young adults, who are at risk for mental illness and whose identities often badly match common gender assumptions in personal informatics systems and 2) autistic young adults, for whom social activities and visualizations may be quite different from neurotypical individuals. A series of grounded design inquiries will provide HCI, visualization, and data science communities with: 1) evidence of how non-expert data practices are formed through interacting with visualizations; 2) participatory design activities and collaborative visual elicitation protocols; 3) analysis of opportunities, impacts, and implications of non-discriminatory visual encodings of personal data; and 4) development and assessment of medium-fidelity prototypes for personal informatics systems for vulnerable populations. Educational activities will train data science students in human-centered design methods to provide future data scientists with tools to mitigate discriminatory design practices as they enter the workforce. Educational assessment will focus on impacts of these methods to prepare students to advocate against biases and make responsible decisions when working with data of vulnerable stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
