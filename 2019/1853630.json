 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important aspect of seeing is deciding what to focus on. Such decisions are governed by activity across multiple brain areas. State of the art models of the human visual system tend to treat it as a feedforward machine, but feedback connections are also very important to the efficiency of biological vision. This project will develop mathematical models of the visual system that demonstrate how visual processing, decision making, and attention are intimately linked. These models will tested on three tasks: visually tracing a curve, visual searching a tree, and detecting motion. Results will show the degree to which the human visual system does not simply filter images, but can perform complex decision making tasks. Treatment of blindness with visual prostheses requires continued research on camera-to-brain interfaces that require deep computational knowledge of the brain's visual processing abilities. This project will develop novel and important mathematical insights into the efficiency of the visual system and the underlying neural principles. Results from this work will also be leveraged to develop course material for newly developed major and professional masters in Statistics and Data Science at CU Boulder, training the next generation of data scientists. In addition, this work will augment typical machine learning approaches to modeling human vision, and potentially inspire new technologies for computer-aided vision and categorization. \r\n\r\nMathematical theories of vision must be extended to address cognitive tasks that reflect the complexity of the natural world. This project advances this effort for three main reasons. First, it focuses on understanding how the visual cortex participates in decision-making, a ubiquitous cognitive process. Most studies of the visual system consider object filtering and image classification. This project will develop spatially-extended neuronal network models that both process spatiotemporal inputs and interpret them to make complex decisions. These models will reflect the geometry of the visual world that humans observe and interpret, and the resulting theories will help to predict strategies people use to make everyday visual decisions. Second, the project is grounded in mathematical models of the visual cortex we will validate with the data sets of experimental collaborators. These models are amenable to mathematical analysis, so the architecture of neuronal networks can be linked to the cognitive computations they perform, providing testable predictions. This skill set will be crucial for analyzing models of spatiotemporal activity in visual cortex. Trainees will become conversant in techniques for the analysis of nonlinear and stochastic systems as well as probabilistic models of decision-making applicable to many problems in science and industry. The PI will share educational graphics, software, and outreach materials on a webpage to communicate findings widely.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Mathematical models of these decision-making processes can be built to try and identify what strategy is best to maximize a particular objective such as accuracy while penalizing costs like time spent or resources consumed to gather information. While such models may tell us what works best, this is not always what people do. People are limited by their own biases and by the finite computational (brain) resources they have available to solve the problem. The outcomes of this project focus on the diversity of strategies people may use to make decisions, especially about visual evidence, the different sources of information (e.g., private research and social information) they may use, as well as the role of neuronal network architecture in shaping the processing of information and the maintenance of choices across time. We have demonstrated that people do use a diversity of strategies to make decisions, but that these strategies often do approximate normative (ideal) strategies, with the caveat that this gets harder to do with more challenging tasks. Our models also demonstrate how evidence individuals collect on their own can be merged with beliefs of their neighbors in a social network, especially showing that it is important to consider neighbors' biases and infer the other information they have received when doing so.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Spatiotemporal activity in neural circuits can implement a combination of evidence accumulation and decision maintenance across time with a carefully balance of spatially arrange excitatory and inhibitory interactions. As part of this project, we were interested in how features of an individual's environment determine biases in their future decisions that may arise through changes in the neural circuits that code for choice.&nbsp;Natural stimulus distributions often exhibit bias humans may learn in order to predict what they will observe next. We developed neural attractor models capable of learning such distributions in tasks where people has to provide an estimate of a color they were shown after a short delay. Long-term synaptic plasticity, a process whereby the connectivity of a neural circuit is changed over time due to the activity of that circuit, has been shown capable of implementing probabilistic inference, where a probability distribution describing the stimuli one expects to see in the future depends on those they see in the past. We validated this theory using published response data from a large human cohort, showing models that learn distributions fit data better than those with fixed network architecture. Extending this work, we have also demonstrated that short term plasticity can help to stabilize (or destabilize depending on the form) memories of visual stimulus estimates across time. In this case, it is important to consider the fact that there are both neurons that provide excitatory input to their targets and those that inhibit. Interestingly, the inhibitory neurons can decrease the stability of visual working memory, in contrast to previous models in which they always serve to stabilize runaway activity.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Beyond modeling observations in laboratory tasks, we have become increasingly interested in how people and other animals integrate and use visual information in the wild, and how these processes are implemented in neural circuits. A first step in this process has been to build evidence-accumulation models of foraging, a process which involves the integration of visual input, and is also implemented by a diversity of organisms in the wild. Thus far, we think the accumulation to bound models we have built provide a bridge between ecology in neuroscience, such that animal behavior can shed light on the plausible neural circuit architectures that could be implementing information integration and decisions. Visual information about one's neighbors in an important component of these decisions too, and we have simple models that could be extended to consider the more complex spatiotemporal landscape of visual information and how this is mapped to complex spatiotemporal activity in the brain.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Looking forward, we think that developing more experimental studies that consider decisions made based on complex spatiotemporal visual information would better help to explain the role of the intricate architecture of visual cortex in shaping decision-making. Given the rapidly growing interest in machine learning algorithms capable of processing and then generating novel visual content, neural data and neural theory informed models could complement these high-throughput deep networks to better build understanding of the processes underlying how artificial intelligence works. Moreover, the brain appears to execute these types of tasks using very low energy overhead, so considering resource-limitations is crucial to having artificial intelligence better mimic human intelligence.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/20/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zachary&nbsp;P&nbsp;Kilpatrick</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1853630/1853630_10616074_1666287617351_schematic--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1853630/1853630_10616074_1666287617351_schematic--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Social foraging\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1853630/1853630_10616074_1666287617351_schematic--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Social foraging\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Coupled accumulation to bound models for social foraging decisions.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">PhD Student, Subekshya Bidari</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zachary&nbsp;P&nbsp;Kilpatrick</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Social foraging</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1853630/1853630_10616074_1666287812719_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1853630/1853630_10616074_1666287812719_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Model of neural activity encoding a remembered continuous variable.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1853630/1853630_10616074_1666287812719_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Model of neural activity encoding a remembered continuous variable.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Excitatory/inhibitory neural circuit for storing and recalling continuous variable values.
