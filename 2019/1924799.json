 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a combined experimental and numerical study of droplet generation by breaking wind waves in the presence of surfactants and salt water.  Measurements of the average spatial distribution and diameters of droplets in wind wave systems have been made in wave tanks and in the field, but the connection between the dynamics of wave breaking and the generation of droplets is unclear as are the effects of water salinity and surfactants on these generation processes.  By combining experimental measurements of the breakers and droplets with numerical simulations of the same breaking events, the strengths of each research method will be used synergistically to explore the physics of the droplet generation mechanisms in breaking waves.  Air-sea transfer of mass, momentum, energy and heat is an important component of the dynamical system controlling the weather and global climate, and droplet generation by breaking waves makes an important contribution to these transfer processes.  The results of this study will be useful for numerical models of the system.  They will also be applicable to understanding engineering flows in which free surface and spray generation are involved, for example in chemical engineering flows. Finally, the droplet diameter and trajectory measurement system used in the proposed study is thought to be adaptable for use as a field measurement system. This project will also contribute to the education of students by fully supporting two graduate students, a half-time postdoctoral researcher and an undergraduate student during the summer months.  At the University of Maryland, the PI will organize a week-long summer school on nonlinear water waves. He will also host students and teachers from a middle school program called ThinkStem in visits to his laboratory.  At the University of Minnesota, the PI will organize and outreach program for high school students from Native American communities. The program consists of a summer camp aimed at enhancing the students' understanding of the environmental fluid flow processes at the water surfaces in the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\nThe experiments will provide, among other quantities, highly resolved measurements of the temporal evolution of the breaking wave profiles and similarly resolved measurements of the size and motions of droplets with diameters down to 100 microns and smaller, while the simulations will compute the evolution of the air and water flow fields with state-of-the-art spatial resolution.  In both the experiments and simulations, the breakers will be generated mechanically with highly repeatable dispersively focused wave packets and augmented by wind.   By introducing soluble surfactants and salt into the water in the experiments and simulations, their effects on wave breaking and droplet generation will be explored.  Both the experiments and simulations will identify the time, location and characteristics of the important droplet generation events during the breaking process.  The experimental measurements of the droplet generation events will be used to provide data and focus for the numerical simulations and provide data for droplets smaller than the simulations can compute.  The simulations will explore the physical processes that generate these droplet ejection events and develop and test sub-grid models for the generation of the smallest droplets.  The effects of salinity and surfactants on each droplet generation process will be examined.  The knowledge of the effects of salinity and surfactants on the droplet production at these experimental/numerical scales will be used to estimate droplet production at some field-scale conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

When waves steepen and overturn during breaking, splashing entraps air and sprays droplets. Bubbles that form under the ocean surface pop at the ocean surface, creating tiny droplets. In the presence of wind shear, the force between the moving wave and the blowing wind creates large droplets known as spumes at the wave crests. These droplets are essential for exchanging heat, mass, momentum, and gas between the ocean and the atmosphere. Quantifying the bulk air-sea exchanges is vital to understanding weather patterns, storm development, and atmospheric chemistry, such as aerosol production. Figure 1 shows a snapshot of a simulated 3D breaking wave with droplets and bubbles generated under different wind conditions.</p>\r\n<p>This project focused on understanding the mechanisms behind the spray droplet generation in breaking waves. To achieve this, we used experiments and computer simulations. Our collaborators performed experiments where they operated a wave tank to generate waves under controlled conditions and measured the droplets' size, speed, and behavior as the waves broke. In tandem, we used high-fidelity computer simulations to capture flow details, such as velocity, pressure, energy, and vorticity distributions. This allowed us to explore details that are difficult to observe in experimental studies of wave breaking.</p>\r\n<p>Through high-fidelity simulations, we studied breaking waves under different wind conditions. The simulations revealed that wind speeds significantly influence droplet size and residence time in the air. At higher wind speeds, we observed more production of droplets. The smaller droplets generated remain airborne for longer times and have high residence times, increasing their potential to influence atmospheric processes. Figure 2 shows the distribution of droplet sizes and their corresponding residence times, highlighting these dependencies. These distributions follow power law behavior. Our results indicate that increased wind speed primarily unaffected the power law behavior.</p>\r\n<p>One of the key findings from our simulation data analysis is that the formation of spray droplets is affected by factors such as breaking intensity (the steeper the wave, the more intense the breaking is observed), wind strength (higher wind speeds cause a violent wave breaking compared to low winds), and whether substances like surfactants are present in the water (it is observed that surfactants affect wave evolution, formation of jets, and air entrainment compared to clean water breaking waves). Surfactants are surface-active agents, such as algal blooms, organic matter, and pollutants, that alter the surface tension of water and are found to play a critical role in bubble dynamics and droplet generation.</p>\r\n<p>We have developed a numerical framework to model insoluble surfactant transport in two-phase flows. In fluid dynamic systems such as breaking waves, the waves evolve rapidly, and bulk diffusion is usually negligible, so the assumption of insolubility is often justified. We studied a single bubble rising in quiescent fluid with and without surfactants. Our simulations revealed that surfactant-laden bubbles rise slowly compared to clean ones. The surfactants accumulate at the bubble bottom as they rise, making the bubble immobile in the accumulated region. This leads to increased overall drag on the bubble motion, thus affecting its shape during the evolution. Figure 3 illustrates the effect of surfactants on bubble velocities and bubble shapes, which are of broader importance in modifying the dynamics of air-sea interactions.</p>\r\n<p>Building on this understanding, we conducted simulations to study the effect of surfactants on breaking waves. Simulations of 2D breaking waves with surfactants revealed changes in the wave profile, jet formation, and air entrainment, as shown in Figure 4. We have also conducted a 3D breaking wave with surfactants; Figure 5 shows a snapshot of our 3D breaking wave simulation with surfactants. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating surfactant effects in climate models that quantify air-sea exchanges. The insights into the role of wind and surfactants in droplet and bubble dynamics from simulations will contribute to a better understanding of how oceanic and atmospheric systems interact.</p>\r\n<p>This project used experimental and numerical studies of breaking waves to fill the current research gaps in spray formation under different environmental conditions. The experimental data provides validation for the simulations, while the simulations offer a detailed view of the processes that are challenging to observe directly through experiments. Together, they advanced our understanding of wave-breaking and droplet dynamics. They also improve the accuracy of models that predict weather and climate and provide insights relevant to environmental issues such as aerosol transport and ocean-atmosphere exchanges.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/04/2024<br>\nModified by: Lian&nbsp;Shen</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1924799/1924799_10626477_1733347326757_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1924799/1924799_10626477_1733347326757_Figure_1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1924799/1924799_10626477_1733347326757_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Simulated spray droplets generated by plunging breaking wave at varied wind speeds.
