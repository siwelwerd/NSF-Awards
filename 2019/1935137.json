 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support fundamental research uncovering new dynamic behaviors in structures, which will promote both the progress of science and technological advance in the field of materials and structures. Metamaterials are engineered systems that exhibit properties not commonly found in conventional materials, which can enhance the control of sound, vibrations and mechanical waves beyond what current technology can produce. Despite recent progress in metamaterial research, fundamental performance limits exist; the effective working frequencies are too high and narrow for many useful structural applications. This project supports fundamental investigations into new dynamical interactions addressing these operational limitations, thereby accelerating the implementation of metamaterials into structural applications. Specifically, the derived theory will yield a new class of dynamical interactions allowing the manipulation of low frequency vibrations, relevant for applications in civil, aerospace, automotive and medical industries, such as constructing resilient infrastructure, vibration attenuation and providing local power to the internet of things. The uncovered new physics and potential applications will positively impact the U.S. technological and scientific edge, ultimately benefiting its economy and society. This research involves multiple disciplines including engineering, physics and applied mathematics, which will allow for leveraging the obtained results to promote Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education. Furthermore, the educational activities will support the participation of underrepresented groups in research, contributing to broadening diversity in engineering education.\r\n\r\nMetamaterials exhibit effective, unconventional properties by engineering unit cells at the micrometer or millimeter scales. However, these properties are strongly dependent on the size of the unit cells, restricting the effective behavior to narrow, high frequency bands or resulting in large arrangements. Thus, there is a need to discover mechanisms allowing to obtain unit-cell size independent, broadband metamaterials. This research investigates a mechanism enabling low frequency, broadband behavior exploiting new types of nonlinear interactions involving transition waves in multistable metastructures. Concretely, this effort will establish physics-based models capturing the excitation of metastructural vibration modes by transition waves, and vice versa. Theoretical and numerical analyses will reveal the dynamical regimes and metastructures' parameters for which such interactions occur. Experiments are planned using 3D-printed multistable metastructures to validate the key physics of such nonlinear interactions. These activities will test the hypothesis stating that transition waves allow for low frequency, broadband dynamical behavior enabling unconventional manipulation of vibrations in structural applications. The overall outcome is a mathematical framework for designing and analyzing metastructural nonlinear interactions, thereby enabling the implementation of metamaterials in structural applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The studied physical mechanisms are based on strongly nonlinear interactions involving non-dispersive waves known as topological solitons or kinks.</p>\n<p>Firstly, we uncovered a new class of nonlinear interactions involving wave (i.e., topological solitons) and vibration modes that we refer to as solitonic resonance. Concretely, these interactions appear in metastructures (e.g., bistable metabeams) that feature a bistable microstructure, the response of which promotes nonlinear coupling between wave and metastructural modes (see Figure 1), generalizing the fluxon-cavity mode resonance observed in superconducting electronics to mechanical systems. We observe both low-to-high and high-to-low incommensurate frequency interactions in the metabeams, thus enabling energy exchange between bands two orders of magnitude apart, providing a general method to extreme frequency conversion in mechanics (see Figure 2). Notably,&nbsp;<em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">the soliton resonant interactions enable extreme frequency conversion and response manipulation in mechanical systems without recourse to dispersion-related phenomena, which are the most prevalent physical mechanisms used for realizing metamaterials.</span> </em></p>\n<p>Secondly, we established that bistable lattices (i.e., lattices with units that can adopt two stable states or phases) could be used for harvesting energy from quasi-static and dynamic inputs without relying on resonantly matched responses. The reliance on resonance has greatly limited the promise of energy harvesting from vibrations, as minor mismatches in the input frequency from which energy is transformed result in a poor conversion. Furthermore, the fundamental connection between unit cell size and effective frequency band for harvesting metamaterials results in implausible large unit cells as most vibrational energy lies in the structural range (below 200Hz). Through analysis, simulations, and experiments, we demonstrated that the dynamics of multistable metastructures allow input-independent energy conversion leveraging phonons exhibiting a single, dominant frequency as they radiate from propagating kinks (see Figure 3). Consequently, the phonon?s frequency invariance enables input-independent resonant harvesting with conventional energy transduction mechanisms localized at a few unit cells. We captured this by observing the formation of a topological wave harvesting pass band where the potential for energy conversion increases almost monotonically.&nbsp;<em>Collectively, these contributions show a mechanism (phonon emission from propagating kinks) that fundamentally&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">breaks the link between the unit cell size and the metamaterial?s operating frequencies</span>, offering a broadband solution to energy harvesting that is particularly robust for low-frequency input sources </em>(Figure 4)<em>. The observed frequency-invariant phonons are intrinsic to the discrete bistable lattices, enabling broadband energy harvesting to be an inherent metamaterial property.</em></p>\n<p>The obtained understanding of the unveiled physics required the derivation of analytical and computational tools. To this end, we developed an analytical model for bistable lattices with graded properties. Our results showed that introducing grading allows for bidirectional excitation of topological solitons from a single site in bistable lattices. This implies that compression and tension (i.e., rarefaction) waves could be achieved by input located at a single lattice site. Consequently, graded properties are crucial for realizing extreme dynamics in metamaterials featuring bistable lattices by enabling continuous excitation from external inputs.</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal of metamaterials design is to utilize extreme dynamics in engineering applications. For strongly nonlinear metamaterials, continuum approximations based on the behavior of unit cells can miss some relevant physics. To address this gap, we develop a dedicated solver capable of handling the strong nonlinearities in multistable metastructures using an efficient computational architecture: the message passing interface (MPI). Our solver is shown to be stable and orders of magnitude faster than commercially available counterparts used for simulating multistable metastructures, such as Abaqus. This software addresses the gap in literature impeding the study of the dynamics of strongly nonlinear, high-dimensional systems (see Figure 5), such as multistable metastructures.
