 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Earth is composed of several distinct layers: the crust at the surface, the mantle which comprises the bulk of our planet, and the metallic core at its center. Heat released from the core drives slow convection of the hot mantle. This process results in the movement of tectonic plates, produces volcanism, and reshapes continents. Recent geophysical studies have suggested that the pattern of convection changes in the mid-mantle, from 800-1300 km depth. The upwelling plumes and subducting slabs which dominate mantle convection appear in seismic tomography images to become deflected in the mid-mantle. It is unknown whether this is due to composition or viscosity.  The upper mantle is known to have similar seismic discontinuities that are thought to be caused by variations in chemistry or mineral phase changes as the mantle gets hotter and pressure increases with depth.  The goal of this research is to use new methods to understand the large reflectors in the mid-mantle by developing comprehensive maps of the small-scale seismic properties, and comparing them to characteristic signatures for different types of geodynamic flow domains, such as known slab or upwelling regions.   This project will support both graduate and undergraduate student research.  The project will foster new international collaborations between New Mexico State University, a Hispanic-serving institution, and universities in Europe and Australia. The work will benefit various other disciplines across the wider Earth Sciences community, and promote Geophysics to minority students in New Mexico.  This project is jointly funded by the Geophysics Program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). \r\n\r\nThis project will determine the varied origins of mid-mantle seismic reflectors, ascertain their spatial relationship to flow patterns in the mantle, such as downwelling cold slabs or upwelling plumes, and investigate potential formative processes and compositional origins. The work will generate comprehensive regional-scale seismic maps of reflectors from 800-1300 km depth in the mantle. Novel and established analytical methods will be applied to compile and evaluate complementary datasets (SS and PP precursors; ScS and PcP reverberations; receiver functions), to constrain reflector geometry, apparent impedance contrast, sharpness, and heterogeneity across multiple length-scales of lateral resolution (100-1,000 km). These observables will be tested and linked via forward modelling of synthetic seismograms. Results will be analyzed in the context of global seismic tomography and geodynamical models, using seismic velocity as a proxy for geodynamical flow. This research will establish the characteristic signatures of mid-mantle reflectors for several well-sampled velocity domains representative of diverse geodynamical settings, incorporating statistical correlations and clustering analysis. Reflector properties from each domain type will be assessed within the framework of global geodynamical numerical simulations, and testing against the influence of different scenarios of convection history. Subsequently, this will inform regarding likely formative mechanisms and thermochemical origins for the reflectors. Synthetic seismic data generated from different geodynamical models will provide a direct comparison to seismic observations. This multidisciplinary approach will inform regarding the influence of seismic transitions on mantle convection and vice versa and elucidate the role of flow for generating physical structures. The project will help to map the seismic signatures of global mid-mantle circulation, characterize thermochemical exchange between lower and upper mantle, and provide insight into the history and style of mantle mixing and dynamics. The results will provide valuable inputs for the next generation of geodynamical simulations and mineral physics studies in the mantle, and have wide implications ranging from the mapping of primordial unmixed mantle reservoirs, to tracing the deep origins of continental volcanism.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Defined as depths from around 300 to 1300 km, the region is characterised by numerous seismic discontinuities, which result from mineral phase transformations, and thermal and compositional heterogeneity. Global discontinuities at approximately 410 and 660 km depth bound the mantle transition zone, and control heat and material flux between the upper and lower mantle. Their depths are influenced by temperature such that their separation provides a first order thermometer for the mantle transition zone, thereby helping to map convection patterns.</p>\n<p>Seismic tomography models reveal that both hot upwelling plumes and cold downgoing slabs become stagnant and trapped at various depths in the upper and mid-mantle (Fig. 1 cartoon). Some of this deflection occurs as a result of the 660 discontinuity, for which the primary phase transition acts to impede both cold downgoing and hot upwelling. A secondary phase transformation of the 660 is associated with very high temperatures, and acts to promote the passage of hot upwelling material. These mechanisms are fairly well documented. However, deflection is also observed at various depths beneath the 660, for reasons which are still debated. Possible causes include a further phase transformation, a jump in viscosity, or large, unmixed ancient structures interfering with the flow of material.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The numerous seismic reflectors detected in the mid-mantle vary widely in their properties, including size, depth, strength, topography, visibility. Yet, there are few mineral phase transformations predicted to occur at these depths in order to explain their presence, and those that do occur here are for very limited compositions. This project combined global seismological observations with mineral physics calculations and dynamical simulations in order to provide improved insights into the nature of the Earth&rsquo;s upper and mid-mantle, its temperature and composition, and dynamic processes.</p>\n<p>The work requires the compilation and processing of huge amounts of seismic data. Here, we use waves which reflect from the top or underside of the mantle discontinuities. In order to expedite data collection, we developed a new computational algorithm &ldquo;Autopicker&rdquo; which uses Convolutional Neural Networks to identify seismic wave phases (Fig. 2). The code automatically and consistently identifies the phases, along with a statistical measure of quality, and with no human input. We show that Autopicker performs at least on par with a human seismologist, and have used the code to compile a massive new dataset sensitive to the upper and mid-mantle.</p>\n<p>Following data compilation, the datasets are analysed in order to extract signals from the mantle discontinuities. This requires &ldquo;stacking&rdquo; &ndash; adding together multiple seismograms, to remove incoherent noise, and amplify the small amplitude discontinuity reflections. Prior studies use regional bins with a fixed parameterisation, however this can introduce bias into the observations, and may not capture topography variations. As part of this project, we developed a new &ldquo;adaptive stacking&rdquo; process, for which the stacking parameterisation is driven by the data itself, incorporating spatial coverage, noise, and topography (Fig. 3).</p>\n<p>Mineral physics modelling reveals the effect of temperature and basalt proportion on the various seismic signals (Fig. 4). Temperature primarily affects depth, whereas basalt fraction causes changes in amplitudes. Temperature also diminishes visibility for some signals. These synthetic calculations allow us to invert our seismic observations in order to determine the best matching thermochemical models for the upper and mid-mantle, as well as generate full catalogs of synthetic databases.</p>\n<p>We examined areas associated with high temperature, and determined a link between the edges of these regions and locations of volcanic activity at Earth&rsquo;s surface (Fig. 5). Dynamically, this identifies regions of hot material stagnant in the mid mantle, trapped beneath the 660. Only the very highest temperature upwellings are able to access the secondary phase transformation of the 660 and traverse the mantle transition zone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A full thermochemical inversion (Fig. 1) revealed various regions of basaltic enrichment and compositional layering, in both hot and cold regions. Analysis in the context of reconstructions of recent plate tectonic history reveal that the cold basaltic regions are associated with recent subduction zones, as a result of compositional segregation of the crust during subduction. The overall basalt enrichment of the mid-mantle indicates the ponding of geochemical reservoirs here, interpreted as due to gravitational trapping.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot basaltic regions suggest global recycling of oceanic crust through the full depth of the mantle, subducted down to the core-mantle boundary where it subsequently becomes entrained into upwelling plumes and stagnates in the mid-mantle.</p>\n<p>Our work has highlighted the need to integrate observations, calculations, and modelling, in order to simultaneously constrain physical structures and establish likely compositional and formative origins, within the context of dynamic setting.&nbsp;These multidisciplinary approaches represent the next step for understanding the nature of the Earth&rsquo;s upper and mid-mantle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/28/2024<br>\nModified by: Lauren&nbsp;Waszek</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1853662/1853662_10607131_1711674343676_ScS--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1853662/1853662_10607131_1711674343676_ScS--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"3.
