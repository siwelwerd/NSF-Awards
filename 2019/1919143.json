The AmpaCity project in Essen Germany is one such example.  However, a major obstacle to achieving that goal is understanding how to design new superconductors that work increasingly close to room temperature. A surprise in recent years was the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in materials that have nothing in common with good metals. Consequently, understanding how such materials superconduct cannot be done with the standard building blocks of solid-state physics.  This award supports research and education towards developing theoretical models to understand such superconductors. The PI will focus on analyzing a new class of recent experiments that offer unprecedented insight into the fundamental building blocks of the cuprate superconductors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to training and mentoring graduate students, the PI will continue broad educational and outreach activities that include giving lectures to local middle-schools and public lectures to raise public awareness of physics.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhile the strange metal has always stood as the basic obstacle in developing a theory of superconductivity in the cuprates, experiments designed to reveal the universal excitations that underly this state of matter have been nonexistent until now. The new experiments, momentum-resolved electron-energy loss spectroscopy (MEELS), measure the two-particle susceptibility and hence have all the many-body information needed to construct the dielectric function and also the single-particle electron self-energy. This award supports research and education towards extracting such information from the MEELS data. \r\n\r\nSpecial emphasis will be placed on comparison with optical measurements. Optical conductivity experiments measure the transverse dielectric response, while MEELS measures the longitudinal dielectric function. A key unanswered question is whether the two are equal. Certainly, they are expected to be equal in the limit of zero-momentum transfer, as any distinction between longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions disappears in this limit.  However, the PI's analysis of the experimental data shows that this is not the case. The same analysis on other materials such as tantalum-diselinide, ruthenates, and even iron-pnictide superconductors reveals complete agreement between zero-momentum limits of the transverse and longitudinal dielectric functions. As this is the first instance where these two limits disagree, the cuprates represent an unprecendeted class of materials. Understanding of this discrepancy is at the heart of this project. The key question that arises is:  Does the discrepancy between these two limits stand at the heart of strange-metal physics? Specific models will be studied to obtain a discrepancy between the two limits, and these models will be used to examine if they simultaneously explain the key characteristic of the strange metal, namely T-linear resistivity.\r\n\r\nIn addition to training and mentoring graduate students, the PI will continue broad educational and outreach activities that include giving lectures to local middle-schools and public lectures to raise public awareness of physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn 1986, a new class of high temperature superconductors were discovered.  Superconductors are important because they are the most efficient means of carrying an electrical curent as no elecrtical loss is incurred.  Aside from energy transmission, superconductors also have great use in medical imaging technology such as MRI.  Hence, finding the next generation of superconductors is of great utility.  The earliest superconductors required refrigeration to liquid helium temperatures.  The new materials exhibit superconductivity at temepratures at which air liquifies.  Refrigeration at such temperatures is cheaper than beer. Hence, such materials represent a major leap forward. What remains bizarre about these materials is that they defy all the traditional rules of how to make a superconductor.  The key dictum was that superconductivity requires a material that is a good metal. Not so with the new materials.  These materials start off their lives as insulators and they become superconducting when a few carriers are introduced into them.  The key theoretical question is where does one start to formulate a theory.  We have managed to accomplish this in this funding period.  We constructed an exactly solvable model for superconductivity and the insulating state and established the conditions under which superconductivity arises.  We have been able to explain several unsresolved experimental features of these materials .  Our theory makes predictions that could be useful in the designing of new superconductors. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/18/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip W Phillips"
