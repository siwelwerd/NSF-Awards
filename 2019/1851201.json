 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use field observations from ship and numerical modeling to study circulation variability in the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River plume in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The region is characterized by a strong sea breeze which leads to the flow and wave variations on relatively small spatial scales of less than 1 km. The observations will take place during two field campaigns including ship, moored, and autonomous platforms. The modeling will include both realistic and idealized models for testing the hypotheses. Two graduate students and two postdocs will participate in the research. In addition, summer research experiences in the field will be provided to 2-3 undergraduates through the TAMU Summer Research Program for Undergraduates, for which applications from underrepresented groups and from local community colleges will be encouraged. The PIs will visit local, minority-serving undergraduate institutions to give presentations on the research and engage students in the summer research program. The project is a collaboration between the US and the United Kingdom (UK) with the UK component being supported by the UK National Environmental Research Council (NERC) through an agreement with NSF.\r\n\r\nRecently theories for ocean dynamics posit that submesoscale flows interacting with near-inertial motions are important for understanding the dynamics of both phenomena. This project will test theories of energy exchange at the submesoscale by studying circulation patterns in the Mississippi-Atchafalaya river plume in the northern Gulf of Mexico using a pair of field campaigns and idealistic and realistic numerical models. Observations from ship, moorings, and autonomous platforms will be made during two field campaigns. The modeling will include a hydrostatic ROMS model and idealized, non-hydrostatic Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The objective will be to characterize, quantify, and understand the energy exchanges between balanced and unbalanced motions and the turbulent cascade that can result from the interaction. Wave-mean flow interactions in the Mississippi-Atchafalaya river plume system could enhance mixing and vertical exchange, which are important for understanding coastal hypoxia and the dispersal of pollutants in the northern Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n \n\n\nThe coastal ocean contains a rich array of physical processes that control the distribution of heat, freshwater, nutrients and other properties that influence ecosystems. The coastal Gulf of Mexico off the Louisiana and Texas coasts is a particularly dynamic region, influenced by the strong and meandering outflow of freshwater from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya River system. That river water is much lighter than the saltier ocean it encounters; as a result it spreads out on top of the ocean, forming a cap of sorts. That cap, and the density contrast it embodies, limits vertical exchange of water masses between the surface and the bottom waters of the coastal ocean. As a result, the bottom waters on the coast are often anoxic - the animals living there use up the dissolved oxygen in the water until the values are too low to effectively support life. So-called ventilation of this bottom boundary layer, by vertical exchange or mixing with water closer to the surface, is necessary to replenish that oxygen. Unfortunately, the physical ocean processes controlling that ventilation are poorly understood. At the same time, the build-up of heat in the upper ocean plays a large role in providing heat that fuels tropical storms and hurricanes in the Gulf. The same poorly understood vertical exchange and mixing processes also set the geography and seasonality of that heat availability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Submesoscales Under Near-Resonant Inertial Shear Experiment (SUNRISE) was designed to better understand the processes that lead to vertical exchanges and mixing of water in the coastal Gulf of Mexico. With NSF funding we carried out substantial numerical modeling over several years, and major fieldwork campaigns in the summers of 2021 and 2022. The fieldwork included making vertical profiles of ocean temperature, salinity, density, dissolved oxygen concentration and turbulent mixing from two research vessels operated by the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, deployment and recovery of surface wave powered Wirewalker profiling instruments, and sampling by novel remotely controlled zodiac boats outfitted with a suite of scientific instrumentation.  The modeling has included both a high resolution detailed regional simulation of the ocean, and idealized process studies designed to explore some of the physical phenomenology in more detail. A key facet of this experiment on all fronts has been collaboration with our partners in the United Kingdom working to understand the same sorts of processes.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur sampling and analysis focused on the interaction between the fronts at the edges of the river plume and something called inertial oscillations. On a rotating planet, the Coriolis effect means that anything that trying to go in a straight line (with respect to the stars) appears to us to curve to the right in the Northern Hemisphere. This effect plays an order one role in global scale ocean currents and atmospheric storms, including Hurricanes. It also has an effect on a smaller scale - when wind impulsively shoves the surface ocean waters, the start moving then curve to the right due to Coriolis, and keep going right and right some more until they move in a circle. The resultant inertial oscillations can be very energetic, especially in this region where they are resonantly forced by the local daily sea breeze.  At the edges of river plumes, this inertial circular sloshing of water back and forth can lead to convergences that pump warm oxygenated water downwards.  As those inertial motions propagate downward, they can also lead to convergent sloshings at the bottom of the coastal ocean that pump colder anoxic water upwards. These observations and new insights will be used to improve forecast modeling of the Gulf of Mexico and its ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JenniferAMackinnon\n"
