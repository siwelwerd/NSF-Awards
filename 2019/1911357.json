 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal targets two important areas of human health through the development of an innovative technology that will improve the efficacy of chemotherapy for cancer patients, and also for antibiotic treatments for patients with septic shock therapy. Biodynamic imaging, a method to detect intracellular motion developed under a previous NSF grant, has the potential to fill this need.  This project will extend biodynamic imaging to measure cell signals in response to immunotherapies as well as antibiotics for bacterial infections. \r\n\r\nBiodynamic imaging uses low-coherence digital holography to detect intracellular Doppler signals from diverse cellular motions inside in vitro and/or ex vivo living tissue. Cellular motions are endogenous and provide a functional imaging approach to measure the pharmacodynamic response of patient tumors or infected tissues to treatment. The long-range goal of this project is to establish biodynamic imaging as the premier phenotyping technology for the selection of personalized medical treatment when drug resistance is the principal barrier to effective treatment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMotion is the defining characteristic of life.  Life is constructed of motions upon motions, from the molecular level to the macroscopic level of the organism.  Therefore, studying motion in living systems yields insights into the mechanisms of health and disease.  This project \"Biodynamic Imaging of Drug Resistance in Living Tissue\" has developed new tools to measure motions inside living tissue by illuminating them with light and measuring the dynamic changes in the reflected light as the tissues were challenged with medical treatments.  New discoveries over the duration of this award include ultra-stable measurements that can detect speeds inside cells down to nanometers per second, phase-contrast detection to track rare intracellular events associated with the health of the tissue, signatures of bacterial infections and their response to antibiotics (including antibiotic resistance) and the first Doppler spectral signatures of immunotherapy.\n\nIntellectual Merit:  The study of intracellular motion through Doppler light scattering, called biodynamic imaging, is a novel new research tool for studying biological tissue dynamics, yielding information on small-scale motions that are below the resolution limits of even super-resolution microscopy.  Biodynamic imaging is opening new territories to explore with potential for new scientific discoveries related to the mechanical dimensions of disease.\n\nBroader Outcomes:  The treatment of disease carries many unknowns, and many patients do not respond to their therapies.  By measuring the direct physiological effect of medicines on living tissue, this research program may have found a way to improve medical therapies by personalizing treatments to the patients based on biodynamic measurements of their own tissues responding to treatments.  This project helped educate four graduate students who received their PhD and became part of the high-tech US workforce, as well as several undergraduates and exchange students from Colombia.  The results of this research have been disseminated to a broad community, educating the public on the important issues of improved disease treatment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David D Nolte"
