 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry supports the research of Professor Elizabeth Jarvo in the Department of Chemistry of the University of California, Irvine.  Professor Jarvo is developing new ways to make carbon-containing molecules used in agriculture, pharmaceuticals, polymers and other materials.  Traditional methods of making these molecules rely on precious metals that are limited in supply and thus, expensive and sometimes hard to obtain.  Dr. Jarvo is trying to replace those metals with more earth abundant nickel-based reagents that would be more environmentally sustainable.  With a focus on how the reaction occurs, the Jarvo laboratory is gaining new insight into carbon-carbon bond forming reactions that are important industrially. This project provides hands-on training to graduate and undergraduate students.  Professor Jarvo also organizes career-development workshops that target female and underrepresented faculty and graduate students.  She co-organizes a day-long research symposium for Southern California undergraduate students and participates in outreach programs that connect the UC Irvine campus to nearby underserved middle schools.\r\n\r\nProfessor Elizabeth Jarvo is developing stereospecific cross-coupling and cross-electrophile coupling reactions of benzylic sulfonamides using nickel catalysts.  These new, catalytic methods enable the synthesis of complex biologically active molecules. For example, the work is defining stereoselective strategies for the synthesis of cyclopropanes, a privileged moiety in medicinal chemistry.  Importantly, mechanistic experiments clarify the factors that govern reactivity of organonickel complexes to favor two-electron reactions versus single-electron reactions, a long-standing challenge in development of nickel-catalyzed reactions. Structural characterization of organonickel intermediates provides experimental evidence for the oxidation state of key catalytic intermediates and facilitates the design of new catalysts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit:\n\n \n\nCatalytic reactions are the cornerstone of efficient and selective syntheses in the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries, however, most examples employ precious metals such as palladium.  Use of sustainable base metal catalysts has been limited, to a major part by lack of detailed mechanistic understanding of the inherent reactivity preferences.  By taking a mechanistic approach to developing new transformations using base metal nickel catalysts, my laboratory provides new catalytic reactions with unique reactivity patterns, at the same time addressing gaps in understanding, reducing our dependence on precious metals and increasing sustainability.  Under this grant, we established an important early step to defining ligand-based control of one- versus two-electron pathways for nickel catalysts.  In general, in development of nickel-catalyzed transformations, there is a common perspective that the choice of substrate is the major determinant in whether reactions proceed through closed or open shell organonickel intermediates.  We provided experimental evidence in the form of competitive reactions of 4-halotetrahydropyrans, that clearly demonstrate that ligands can provide the tuning control and promote either one- or two-electron reactions.  Our data provides context and insight into general ligand trends observed across a broad range of nickel-catalyzed reactions, including stereoablative and stereospecific cross-coupling and cross-electrophile coupling reactions.  Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time, in competitive reactions that nitrogen-based ligands promote one-electron reactions that proceed through nickel(I) intermediates, and phosphine-based ligands promote two-electron reactions that proceed cleanly through nickel(0)-nickel(II) cycles. \n\n \n\nAn additional aim of this grant was to establish a new oxidative addition partner for nickel-catalyzed reactions, sulfonamides.  Sulfonamides are common functional groups in chemical building blocks and medicinal agents.  Traditionally, activation of C-N bonds for oxidative addition has required formation of ammonium salts or restriction within strained rings.  With support from this grant, we have established that simple sulfonamides can undergo oxidative addition with low-valent nickel catalysts to participate in new coupling and conjunctive reactions. We have developed two new transformations that initiate with this key step.  We demonstrate Kumada coupling reactions for stereospecific formation of new C-C bonds.  We also demonstrate a new domino reaction that initiates by oxidative addition of a sulfonamide.  This transformation generates three new C-C bonds as well as a cyclopropane ring.  This strategy provides rapid assembly of pharmaceutically-relevant building blocks, including new compounds that we establish have activity against cancer cell lines.  As part of these efforts, we establish new aza-Prins reactions for facile synthesis of the alkynyl piperdines, the starting materials for our domino reactions as well as useful building blocks for heterocycle synthesis. \n\n \n\nBroader impacts. \n\n \n\nThe completed research impacts the fields of catalysis and synthetic organic chemistry by establishing new reactive organic partners for nickel catalysts and new synthetic strategies for rapid assembly of bioactive compounds.  Importantly, mechanistic experiments define the factors that govern reactivity of organonickel complexes to favor two-electron reactions versus single-electron reactions, a long-standing challenge in development of nickel-catalyzed reactions.\n\n \n\nThis award has supported our outreach programs that provide mentoring and career-development opportunities for underrepresented students (from middle school, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral fellows) and faculty.  The LEAPS program brings underserved middle school students to our laboratory for hands-on experiments, with the long-term goal of increasing participation and awareness of chemical research by underrepresented middle school students.  My laboratory participated in our first post-pandemic visit in May 2022 with hands-on experiments in my laboratory.  We have co-sponsored a day-long undergraduate research symposium, held each summer (2019, 2021, and scheduled for 2022).  Undergraduate researchers from across southern California attend to present their research in a poster session and participate in career-development sessions.  In 2021, 100 undergraduates from &gt;20 institutions participated.  We have been organizing the 2022 event, which will be held on August 12, 2022.  The long-term goal of this annual symposium is to increase engagement and mentoring opportunities for underrepresented students.  Furthermore, this grant has supported workshops for career-development for underrepresented scientists and engineers at UC Irvine.  In January 2022, three COACh workshops were held:  a faculty workshop 'Inclusive Leadership and Networking for Science and Engineering' and two sessions of workshops for graduate students and postdocs 'Career Launch and Acceleration.'\n\nGraduate and undergraduate students have been trained in mechanistic analysis, reaction development, and organometallic chemistry.  Graduate students, undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows are being trained and mentored in many career development skills, including describing their research to a lay audience.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/05/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth Jarvo"
