 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nNon-lipid components coupled to lipid membranes directly interact with one another but also feel effective interactions through the membrane. In particular, phase transitions in non-lipid components vary significantly from the bulk when a subset of components is membrane-coupled.  Some past work has explored these differences for membranes that are themselves homogeneous.  The objective of the current study is to explore systems in which both membranes and non-lipid components are capable of experiencing miscibility phase transitions.  These systems represent novel biomaterials in which membrane-based signals are actuated to non-membrane processes, similar to common themes in signaling pathways.   The research will use thermodynamic simulations and experiments in two well-defined model systems: one incorporating polyelectrolytes that form liquid phases in the bulk, and a second utilizing engineered DNA origami tiles that assemble into two dimensional lattices when coupled to membranes.   \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nLipid membranes form boundaries between animal cells and their environments and define some subcellular compartments, such as the cell nucleus and mitochondria. These membranes are primarily made of lipids, soap-like molecules that spontaneously form into fluid, flexible sheets that act as boundaries to large or charged molecules.  Cell membranes also contain embedded proteins, which are more complicated molecular machines that carry out an array of biological functions.  Within cells, the material properties of the membrane helps to organize some embedded proteins, and contributes to the assembly of larger structures that are tethered to the membrane.  Cells take advantage of this coupling to transduce signals across membranes, or to sense chemical or mechanical changes to membrane properties.  This project draws inspiration from cells to develop minimal systems to explore the fundamental concepts that underlie these biological processes.  Researchers will explore the two well-controlled systems of charged polymers and engineered DNA origami tiles tethered to membranes, and will identify how membranes influence the organization and assembly of non-lipid components and how the organization of non-lipid components impact membranes.  The long-term goal is to inspire new materials that can sense and respond to a wide range of environmental stimuli. The researchers will communicate their findings through publications, conference presentations, public lectures, and by incorporating research into undergraduate curricula. The principle investigators will train undergraduate and graduate students for careers in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis collaborative research grant studied how forces generated by diverse and heterogeneous lipids can be used to assemble liquid droplets of proteins at the membrane interface.  This theoretical and experimental collaboration took inspiration from a family of structures that are commonly seen in biology, but whose physical underpinnings were not understood; what we term surface densities, wherein a thin droplet of proteins prewets a membrane, connected through specific tethering molecules, to particular domains of membrane lipids.  Examples include the post-synaptic density where receptors and enzymes cluster at connections between neurons, mediating their communication and signaling clusters, wherein the addition of a chemical signal leads to the clustering of receptors for that signal, along with the protein machinery for amplifying and responding to signal.   The research carried out as part of this grant has been aimed at exploring the physical principles that determine the structure of these surface densities.  We have argued that they are examples of a novel ?prewetting-like? phase transition, that involves physical forces generated by the membrane?s proximity to a critical phase transition and by protein-protein interactions.\n\n \n\nIn the past several years, there has been substantial excitement around the idea that thermodynamic phase separation could be the driver of organization in the cytoplasm -analogous to oil and water- and in lipid membranes, where there are only two spatially extended directions so that domains are spots. Cytoplasmic domains are driven by specific interactions between proteins, while lipids can mediate less specific interactions that can nonetheless drive phase separation in two dimensions.  But there are other ways for three dimensional interactions to drive two dimensional phase transitions.  One familiar example is a wetting transition ? for example, when a drop of water- a three dimensional liquid -  is absorbed onto an effectively two dimensional sheet of paper.  In this case a phase which is stable in three dimensions changes its localization to sit closer to a surface it prefers.  More closely related to this research is a prewetting transition, which can occur at a surface even under conditions when the bulk phase would not phase separate on its own.  Prewetting transitions are most properly thought of as a two dimensional transitions- a liquid can form a molecularly thin film on a surface, but it is unstable more than a few molecules distance away from the surface. \n\n \n\nFor non-biological materials that have been studied previously, prewet phases have been ephemeral and hard to find.  Most prior work has considered prewetting onto solid structures, and the resulting prewet phases are typically stable only when a system is brought extremely close to parameters where it would undergo a true three-dimensional phase transition.  But biological surfaces are different- they are complex two-dimensional membranes which themselves have a tendency to phase separate.  And they interact with three dimensional components through specific molecules which are mobile in the two dimensions.  \n\n \n\nIn the main theoretical output of this research we developed an analytic model and simulation framework to study the phase diagram for a prewetting like transition wherein the surface is a two dimensional fluid (a cellular membrane) itself prone to phase separation, and wherein a bulk mixture is composed of polymers in solvent, prone to phase separating into a three dimensional liquid.  This work is motivated by structures like the synapse in immune cells  and neurons, as well as signaling clusters that form when many types of receptors are bound by their ligand.  We find a very large regime of prewetting that can exist far outside of where either the membrane or the proteins can phase separate on their own.  In addition we find that as the membrane gets near to its critical point, the regime of prewetting gets very large, requiring only a small amount of interaction between bulk proteins.\n\n \n\nWe are also demonstrating this on the experimental side, by looking at simplified synthetic systems wherein we can measure the phase diagram for mixtures of lipids and proteins where we can independently tune the membrane?s propensity to phase separate and the three-dimensional bulk fluid?s tendency to demix.  With this system we have verified some of the main predictions of our theoretical model; that such systems can phase separate in regimes where neither the membrane nor the proteins would on their own, and that bringing the membrane near it?s phase transition dramatically widens the regime in which this transition  occurs.\n\n \n\nWe are following this work up specifically by looking at how these prewet like phases could be used to integrate signals arriving at the membrane, transducing them into biochemistry inside of the cell.  In addition we are looking at how to extend our theoretical framework to understand the phases that form on chromosomes, where a polymer collapse transition of the polymers replaces the liquid-liquid phase transition of the membrane. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/14/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin B Machta"
