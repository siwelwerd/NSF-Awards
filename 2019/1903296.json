 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research was funded under the NSF Engineering - UKRI Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council opportunity NSF 18-067.  In dense urban areas, the underground is exploited for a variety of purposes, including transport, additional residential/commercial spaces, storage, lifelines, geothermal heat pump systems, and industrial processes.  These uses all can contribute to changes in subsurface temperature, groundwater levels and flow.  With the rise in urban populations and significant improvements in construction technologies, the number of subsurface structures is expected to grow in the next decade, leading to subsurface congestion and potentially deleterious effects to subsurface temperature and water conditions. With correct planning, subsurface temperatures can be harnessed beneficially.  However, if unchecked, they can result in a high environmental and economic costs. The combination of specially packaged monitoring equipment and an open-source underground climate model developed in this project will provide a robust framework to assess underground conditions and evaluate future evolution and potential impacts.  Cities, local and state governments, agencies, utilities, as well as citizens, will be able to access these tools to make more informed decisions, avoid environmentally unsustainable practices, and extract value more fairly.  In the long term, awareness of the health status of the underground is a step towards sharing responsibility for its sustainable and fair use. The ultimate goal is for every city to generate reliable maps of underground climate, with the ability to understand the influence of future urbanization scenarios. The outreach strategy is focused on engaging with the wider community and the profession to raise awareness of the issues and provide tools to explore solutions.\r\n\r\nIn collaboration with researchers at the University of Cambridge, the project will develop a framework for monitoring and predicting temperature and groundwater distributions at high resolutions in the presence of underground heat sources and sinks.  A low cost and reliable underground weather station using the fiber optic sensing technologies will be developed and installed at sites in the US and UK.  A high-performance computing based thermo-hydro coupled underground climate change code will be developed to simulate the temperature and groundwater variation with time at the whole city scale.  The main scientific deliverable from the district- and city-scale numerical simulations and the experimental temperature monitoring is a series of archetype emulators, which are defined based on the geological characteristics, above ground built environment, such as surface and buildings types, and the density and type of the underground structures.  These archetype emulators will allow efficient city-scale modelling and enable application of the methodology to any other city or region with similar characteristics of above and underground built environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, there is limited research on the extent of underground climate change at the city level due to the lack of historical and future underground climate change models at a large scale, and the scarcity of long-term underground temperature monitoring systems. This research titled \"Modeling and Monitoring of Urban Underground Climate Change\" hypothesizes that the high temperatures around tunnels and underground basements, rising temperatures within the aquifer, and inadequate ventilation in the underground railway networks require more detailed and reliable knowledge of the urban underground thermal status.</p>\n<p>The main objective of this joint NSF-EPSRC research was to improve our understanding of the influence of the urban underground on subsurface temperature rise at the city scale and examine the potential to supply a city's heating and cooling demand through the use of shallow geothermal heat exchangers. The ultimate goal was to enable cities to produce accurate maps of underground climate, with the ability to understand the impact of future urbanization scenarios. The project developed a comprehensive framework that could monitor and predict temperature and groundwater distributions at a high resolution in the presence of underground heat sources and sinks. The project relied on a combination of numerical modeling, continuous temperature and groundwater monitoring, and statistical analyses and consisted of four major activities.</p>\n<p>Research 1 - The project developed low-cost and reliable underground weather stations using fiber optic sensing technologies. Four shallow and one deep distributed fiber optic temperature based weather stations were installed inside the UC Berkeley campus. The depths of the shallow weather stations range between 12 and 25 meters, whereas the depth of the deep station is 130 meters. The distributed temperature profiles were taken every month, illustrating the seasonal variation of underground temperature near the ground surface.</p>\n<p>Research 2 - A high-performance computing-based thermo-hydro coupled underground climate change code was developed to simulate the temperature and groundwater variation with time at a large scale. As part of the Treasure Island redevelopment project in San Francisco Bay area, a case study was conducted considering a series of energy piles that are installed at the footprint area where new buildings are planned to be constructed. The UC Berkeley campus plans to upgrade the existing campus energy delivery system to a central heat pump system that includes geothermal heat/cold storage. The study utilized the developed HPC thermo-hydro code coupled with building physics models such as Modelica to examine sustainable and resilient planning of the district-scale geothermal application for the campus.</p>\n<p>Research 3 - An analytical solution-based model of a bidirectional aquifer thermal energy storage system was also developed to simulate the spatiotemporal thermal response of an aquifer at city-scale. The project incorporated machine learning technology to evaluate the model parameters based on the aquifer properties, layer geometry, and thermal properties, as well as operational properties such as injection and extraction of cold/hot water and their rates.</p>\n<p>Research 4 - The primary scientific outcome of the district- and city-scale numerical simulations and the experimental temperature monitoring was a series of archetype emulators.

These archetype emulators allow for efficient city-scale modeling and enable the methodology to be applied to any other city or region with similar above and underground built environment characteristics.
