 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mercury (Hg) is released from both natural sources and human activities. The goal of this project is to make measurements of mercury for an entire year in two contrasting forest locations. This rich dataset will be used to better understand how Hg moves through trees, soil, and the atmosphere. Understanding the distribution of mercury is important because it is a toxic substance, which can cause negative neurological effects in humans and react with other atmospheric gases. The knowledge from this project will be useful for assessing the global distribution of a mercury so that international recognized goals for reducing Hg pollution can be achieved. Additionally, the project will provide partial support for a postdoctoral researcher, two graduate students, and one undergraduate student per year.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric mercury deposits via various dry and wet (e.g., rainfall) deposition processes, including gaseous mercury uptake by plants. Mercury in vegetation is transferred to soils when plants die off or shed leaves, contributing 54-94% of mercury in soil. In the absence of direct measurements, gaseous elemental mercury (Hg[0]) deposition is inferred from litterfall and passive membranes, yet these are not ideal proxies for net Hg(0) deposition as they don?t account for re-emission. Consequently, first objective of this project is to quantify the magnitude and temporal dynamics of net gaseous dry Hg(0) deposition (sum of gross deposition minus emission) in two forests with different seasonalities, a deciduous temperate forest and an evergreen subtropical rain forest. Net Hg(0) deposition will be measured using micrometeorological measurements on large towers, the only available method for direct, non-intrusive and time-extended measurements of net Hg(0) exchange at the ecosystem level encompassing all underlying sinks and sources. The second objective is to partition Hg(0) fluxes into canopy and soil contributions via deployment of two corresponding flux systems - one above the forest canopy to measure ecosystem-level Hg(0) exchange and a second system below the canopy to quantify soil contributions. Canopy Hg(0) fluxes will be calculated by difference. Flux partitioning will provide annual, seasonal and diurnal Hg(0) sink (e.g., to canopies) and source strengths (e.g., from soils) needed to constraint Hg(0) deposition in global and regional chemical transport models. Finally, the third goal of this work is to elucidate pathways of deposition by comparing Hg(0) fluxes to those of carbon dioxide, ozone, water vapor, and carbonyl sulfide. All these trace gases have different sinks and sources in ecosystems and vary in their degree of canopy, stomatal, mesophyll and soil contributions to fluxes. Comparison among fluxes, including seasonality, diurnality and component fluxes will allow us to quantify the degree to which Hg(0) exchange is coupled to photosynthetic activity, stomatal conductance, enzymatic activity within leaves, external cuticular uptake and soil exchange.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In this project, we provide measurement-based evidence that forests constitute major atmospheric mercury sinks via uptake of gaseous mercury. Using micrometeorological instruments deployed on large towers above forests (Figure 1), we present a total of three years of atmospheric mercury deposition measurements over both a coniferous forest in Maine and a deciduous forest in Massachusetts, USA. Measurements show annual gaseous mercury deposition from the atmosphere to forests of 13.4 ? 0.80 &mu;g m<sup>&minus;2</sup> (coniferous forest) and 25.1 ? 2.4 &mu;g m<sup>&minus;2</sup> (deciduous forest), respectively (Figure 2). Gaseous mercury deposition accounts for 62% and 76% of total mercury deposition observed in the two forests (with the remainder originating from deposition via rain and snow and other forms of mercury). Atmospheric gaseous mercury deposition is strongest during daytime and active growing periods, and behaves similarly to atmospheric carbon dioxide uptake (Figure 2 and 3). This provides evidence that vegetation is taking up atmospheric mercury via their leaves similar to carbon assimilation during photosynthesis. We also observe periods of nighttime deposition and variable patterns of exchanges over forest floors/soils (i.e., both deposition and emissions; Figure 3). The patterns observed over forest floors/soils suggest that variable deposition pathways exist across different forest types and/or regions.</p>\n<p>The onset of atmospheric gaseous deposition to forests starting in spring led to corresponding atmospheric mercury concentration declines (Figure 4). We propose that in the absence of complex and expensive deployment of tower-based measurement systems as used in this study, simple ambient air mercury monitoring can provide proxy measurements to determine ecosystem mercury deposition. We also tested the performance of passive samplers recently developed for atmospheric monitoring. We found that while passive samplers performed well in tracking seasonal gaseous atmospheric mercury concentrations, they have inherent limitations to quantify ecosystem deposition processes. Finally, estimation of mercury deposition to vegetation using global datasets of vegetation samples analyzed for mercury suggest that plants globally may take up 2,422 ? 483 to 2,705 ? 504 metric tons of atmospheric gaseous mercury each year. This massive amount of mercury deposition would turn over the entire global atmospheric mercury pool of 4,800 Mg about every two years.</p>\n<p>This study produced and contributed to 9 peer-reviewed scientific publications which so far generated 214 citations in other published articles.
