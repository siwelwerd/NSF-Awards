 "awd_abstract_narration": "Detecting change from a temporal sequence of collected data is important in a wide variety of applications, including speech recognition, medical monitoring, credit card fraud detection, automated target recognition, and video surveillance. In applications such as medical monitoring, it is very important to find where the change occurs. In other applications, such as video surveillance, the type of change, e.g. the movement or insertion/deletion of an object of interest, is also critical.  While detecting such changes from direct data (e.g. images already formed) has been well studied, there are many applications, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) where the temporal sequence of data are acquired indirectly. The typical approach to detecting changes in these applications would be to first form the image or signal of interest.  As a consequence, information that is stored in the indirect data that may be valuable to detecting change is often lost. Therefore, this project seeks to develop accurate, efficient, and robust computational algorithms for detecting changes in a signal or image from a given temporal sequence of indirect data without first reconstructing the signal or image of interest. Additionally, the project seeks to incorporate the change information  to develop better image and signal reconstruction algorithms.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research investigations to enhance their career preparation in science and engineering.  The participants will apply these new techniques on publicly available data sets, notably obtained for MRI, ultrasound, and SAR applications.  \r\n\r\nThe PIs will employ tools in frame theory, optimization, and statistics to develop and rigorously analyze new change detection and image/signal recovery algorithms. Specifically, the PIs will address the following technical issues in the proposed work: (1) the incorporation of prior information with appropriate mathematical/statistical formulation in the model; (2) the extraction of rotation/translation of an object from a sequence of indirect data; (3) model parameters tuning through statistical analysis; (4) the employment of intra- and inter-signal correlations in the recovery algorithms; (5) the design of distributed algorithms for the resulting large-size optimization model.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe main purpose for this project was to develop algorithms that detect change from a temporal sequence of (indirect) data. For example, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data can both be viewed as Fourier data. Typically such data are first processed to form images (or signals) before medical practitioners and domain scientists analyze the information for the task at hand.A main feature of many of the algorithms developed for this project is to be able to bypass (at least partially) the step of image recovery while sill being able to detect change from the collected data.This is important because (1) it is more efficient if the sequential images do not have to first be formed and (2) it prevents loss of information that is inevitable in the image formation. In particular, the information that is discarded in the image recovery process is often valuable in recovering features such as edges, which can indicate change in a scene. Additionally, the algorithms developed incorporated a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) approach, which provides the ability to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated recovery (or change). This in turn allows practitioners to make informed decisions based on the probability of the accuracy of the point estimate solution. Finally, the PIs also considered complex-valued images, where changes in the phase are important in understanding more nuanced changes, for example if a person walked throuh the underlying scene of interest. Such a change would not be visible if only the magnitude information was given.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n\nThe PIs and their collaborators used tools from numerical analysis, optimization and statistics to develop the change detection techniques.They further incorporated statistical information to ensure that the parameter selection in their new algorithms is appropriate, and when possible, recovered solutions as distributions. Each algorithm was developed to be accurate, efficient, and robust to perturbations. The PIs demonstrated how to effectively exploit inter- and intra--image data from sequential acquistions to efficently and accurately generate sequential images. In each case, the algorithms used rigorous mathematical analysis to ensure robustness.\n\n\nBroader Impact\n\n\nThe project provided opportunities for undergraduate students from Dartmouth College and other institutions to learn about computational inverse problems, image recovery, partial Fourier reconstruction, edge detection, change detection, statistical inference methods, and uncertainty quantification.
