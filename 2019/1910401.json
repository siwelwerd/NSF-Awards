 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of living cells to maintain their internal mechanical stress in response to external disturbances is essential for normal physiological functions of cells and tissues and for a protection against various diseases.  This is known as tensional homeostasis.  Breakdown of tensional homeostasis is the hallmark of most advanced solid cancers (carcinomas), as well as of stiffening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and clot formation (thrombosis).  While physical interactions between cells appear to be fundamental to tensional homeostasis, important questions remain.  First, it is not known how the transmission of forces between cells impacts tensional homeostasis.  Second, there is little understanding of how cells respond to external changes in their mechanical environment (e.g., mechanical stretch) after having initially achieved a steady state.  In order to address these questions, this project will advance and apply a biomechanical imaging computational platform.  The fundamental questions that can be answered using this technique will improve basic understanding of how cells respond to their mechanical environment.  The biomechanical imaging methods and software will be distributed to any interested researcher in order to broadly disseminate this technique within the cellular mechanobiology and tissue engineering communities.  In addition, graduate students and undergraduate students will be trained in a highly multidisciplinary environment and will mentor high school students for a six-week research experience.\r\n\r\nThe biomechanical imaging computational platform maps intracellular stress distribution through simultaneous measurements of (1) traction forces that are transmitted by cells to the substrate and (2) intracellular displacements generated by externally applied stretch.  In this project, the researchers will first improve the ability of the biomechanical imaging technique by using mitochondria as fiduciary markers in order to obtain more accurate maps of intracellular stress.  The improved technique will then be used to address two fundamental questions.  First, the impact of external stretch on tensional homeostasis of multicellular clusters will be investigated.  This will be done using bovine aortic endothelial cells and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells.   Second, the system will be used to unravel the relevance of intercellular stress transmission on tensional homeostasis.  This will include the investigation of the role of cell-cell adherens junctions and the impact of substrate stiffness on both cell-cell vs cell-matrix force transmission.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nHomeostasis is a fundamental concept in physiology which describes the ability of living systems to maintain stability of their physiological functions (e.g., body temperature, blood sugar level, blood pressure, etc.) in responses to perturbations from their environment. Any breakdown in homeostasis is a hallmark of disease progression including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and cancer. The concept of homeostasis as the ability of a living system to maintain a set point physiological represents a quasi-static point of view, which was merely concerned with maintaining the status quo, like a household thermostat. However, homeostasis is a dynamic phenomenon, constantly oscillating around a set-point, monitoring the cellular environment, always ready to reset itself, but also to provide the reference point for a change if necessary for survival in an ever-changing environment. Our studies have been focused on the dynamic nature of homeostasis of intracellular mechanical stress (of tension) - tensional homeostasis. This is important given the pluripotent role of mechanical stresses and strains in  mechanobiology of cells. Cellular traction forces, which arise as a result of transmission of intracellular tension to the substrate, exhibit temporal fluctuations. If the range of these fluctuations becomes large in comparison with the mean traction force, cells cannot maintain tensional homeostasis, like when fluctuations of body temperature exceed their normal physiological range the body cannot maintain its homeostatic temperature of 37 C. This dynamic nature of cellular traction forces prompted us to define tensional homeostasis as the cells ability to maintain a consistent level tension with a low level of temporal fluctuations.\n\n\nWhile the concept of tensional homeostasis has been known for nearly\nthree decades, mechanisms that are responsible for maintaining tensional homeostasis have been largely unknown. In our previous NSF project grant, we found that intercellular force transmission may be important for maintenance of tensional homeostasis in clusters of cells that form monolayers in vivo (e.g., endothelial and epithelial cells). In this project, we focused on how cell-cell junctions which transmit mechanical forces between adjacent cells might affect tensional homeostasis.\n\n\nTo study how cancer-induced mutations of E-cadherin, a protein responsible for intercellular force transmission, affect tensional homeostasis, we carried out measurements in gastric cancer cells transfected with E-cadherins with different types of mutations. We found out that intracellular mutations of E-cadherin had detrimental effects on tensional homeostasis, whereas extracellular mutations had no significant effects. This, in turn, indicates that impaired intracellular force transmission between the cytoskeleton and the cell membrane causes brake down in homeostasis.\n\n\nWe also investigated tensional homeostasis at the focal adhesion (FA) level. The most striking feature of FA dynamics that we observed is that the substrate displacement resulting from FA traction forces is a unifying feature that determines FA tensional stability. Beyond ~1 m of substrate displacement, FAs, regardless of cell type or substrate stiffness, exhibit a precipitous drop in temporal fluctuations of traction forces. These findings suggest that traction force dynamics collectively determines whether cells or cell ensembles develop tensional homeostasis, and this insight is necessary to fully understand how matrix stiffness impacts cellular behavior in health and in diseases such as cancer or vascular aging, where environmental stiffness is altered.\n\n\nTo study tensional homeostasis of cellular clusters, we needed to culture cells on micropatterned islands of different sizes in order to control the number of cells and the shape of clusters. Previously, microprinting required a two-step procedure. Our new technique can produce micropatterned islands in a single step. This allows for much more consistent creation of high-fidelity micropatterned islands than previously. Furthermore, the shape and size of the island patterns made with this method are also more easily controlled than those made with the previous two-step method. In order to minimize the detrimental effect of stress concentration on traction calculations which we observed on square-shaped islands, we generated circular-shaped islands. For tracking displacements of micropatterned dots on circular islands, we developed a new method of tracking.\n\n\nFinally, we carried out a secondary analysis of data previously obtained\nfrom cells subjected to periodic uniaxial stretch. The purpose of this analysis was to investigate whether observed stretch-induced reorientation of traction forces was associated with tensional homeostasis. Our analysis showed that the reorientation of traction forces was accompanied by attenuation of temporal variability of the traction field to the level that was observed in the absence of stretch. These findings represent a first quantitative experimental evidence that stretch-induced reorientation\nof cellular traction forces is associated with the cells tendency to achieve tensional homeostasis.\n\n\nThe basic science contributions of this grant resulted in nine  peer-reviewed publications. All these articles are original  contributions. The\nwork was presented at six national/international conferences and three\ninvited talks.\n\n\nThis grant project provided numerous training opportunities for young\nscientists-in-training. Eight graduate students (two PhD candidate, two MS candidates, and 4 rotation students) and seven undergraduate students worked on various aspects of this project.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DimitrijeStamenovic\n"
