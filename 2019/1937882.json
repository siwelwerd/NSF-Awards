 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) is a top-tier venue for quick and wide dissemination of cutting-edge research results in computer security applications. The conference achieves this by hosting several technical sessions, workshops, training sessions, keynotes by distinguished speakers, case studies, panels, national interest discussions, work-in-progress talks and poster sessions. The 2019 ACSAC conference will consist of approximately 48 technical papers across a wide spectrum of computer security and privacy domains. The hard topic theme of the 2019 conference is \"Deployable and Impactful Security.\" The conference agenda explores some of the most intriguing and pressing challenges in the discipline, highlighting open avenues for further work in these areas. Participation in the conference is thus a valuable opportunity to students and is an important part of graduate education in cyber-security.\r\n\r\nThis award provides travel support to encourage participation in the 2019 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field as demonstrated by statement of research, CV showing research output, coursework and/or project experience, etc. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
