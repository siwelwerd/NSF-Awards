 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support student travel for attending ACM e-Energy 2019 (The Tenth International Conference on Future Energy Systems), which will be held at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix, Arizona, June 25-28, 2019. The organizing committee will review applications and select 10 candidates that closely satisfy the participation criteria. Participation of early career post-docs and students in the ACM e-Energy will contribute to their education and provide them opportunities for career development by engaging them with the exchange of the newest ideas on this topic, presentation of their work, and networking with others. ACM e-Energy 2019 conference will contribute to the science, engineering and education on future energy systems, which will lead to the development of future energy systems that are cleaner, more efficient, and more sustainable. To broaden participation, women and students from underrepresented groups will be encouraged to apply.  \r\n\r\nThe ACM e-Energy conference is aiming at promoting research and education at the intersection of computing, communication, and control of energy systems. ACM e-Energy specifically focuses on the application of new computing, communication and networking technologies to the control and operation of energy systems. Although still a young conference (in its 10th year in 2019), ACM e-energy has established itself as the premiere forum to attract professors, postdocs, researchers from national labs and industry, and students.   Educating and engaging students and early-career post-doc researchers is one of the key objectives of ACM e-Energy. This funding will allow students and early-career post-doc researchers to attend the workshop to present their work, be exposed to new ideas, and network with other researchers and professors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
