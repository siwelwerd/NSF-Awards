 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the ability to detect and prevent fires in lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries have become the preferred mode of energy storage and reuse in numerous applications ranging from mobile phones to aircraft. The low safety of current Li-ion batteries has led to a number of accidents in various applications ranging from computers to electric vehicles and aircraft.  Excessive heat release from one cell can compromise the safety of the entire battery pack and the host system. By eliminating the potential for fires in each cell, the proposed technology will enable the construction of larger format cells to reduce the battery integration costs. Improved safety also will usher in the move towards higher energy density cells and open new applications that can benefit from Li-ion batteries.  The projects potential societal impacts include significant revenues if successful, increased safety and even lives saved, increased penetration of energy storage and associated environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an innovative technology to improve the safety of Li-ion batteries and prevent fire due to manufacturing defects, abuse and abnormal use. In today's batteries, these failures trigger exothermic reactions that can transition into uncontrolled thermal runaway. The resulting fires have impacted the safety of various systems ranging in scale from small (mobile phones and computers) to very large (aircraft). The objective of this effort is to develop a technology embedded in a compact sleeve that slides over the cells in a battery pack to passively detect the conditions and isolate the failing cells to prevent their thermal runaway. The Phase I research consists of designing the safety sleeves for select Li-ion battery chemistries and geometries, then demonstrating their effectiveness in detecting and preventing thermal runaway in both individual cells and in battery packs. The results from Phase I research will be used to design prototype sleeves for additional battery sizes, shapes and chemistries that will be tested further in Phase II.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Starting from a single cell, thermal runaway can easily propagate throughout the battery pack endangering the safety of the host system and nearby lives and property. Belmont Scientific, Inc. developed a compact, lightweight device that detects and prevents thermal runaway in Li ion batteries. The Phase I research focused on determining the feasibility of detecting and preventing thermal runaway in individual Li ion cells and battery packs subjected to thermal abuse with this device. Baseline tests with commercial Li ion cells of two different sizes (18650 and 26650) showed that they undergo thermal runaway and reach temperatures of 535 degrees to 680 degrees C and heating rates exceeding ~2000 C/min when subjected to thermal abuse in an oven heated to 150 to 175 degrees C. These tests showed that the safety mechanisms in current commercial cells such as shutdown separators, vents, and thick cell walls are not adequate to protect against thermal runaway. Thermal abuse of cells equipped with the safety devices developed in this project showed that the cells overheated by a maximum of 10 degrees C relative to the oven and peak heating rates of ~20C/min. The effectiveness of the proposed technology at the battery pack level was demonstrated using CFD simulations. Thermal abuse of the center cell in a 25-cell simulated battery pack with baseline 18650 cells led to thermal runaway in that cell which then propagated and consumed the entire pack.&nbsp;When the cells were equipped with the safety devices, the thermal abuse of the center cell caused mild overheating in that cell. Heat transfer from that cell heated the neighboring cells by a maximum of ~10 degrees C which is well within the safety factor for Li ion cells. Therefore, the Phase I research clearly demonstrated that the BSI safety devices are extremely effective in detecting and preventing thermal runaway in Li ion cells and battery packs. This technology is self-contained and does not rely on any other sensors or equipment. It can be used to improve the safety of Li ion batteries in various applications including consumer electronics, automotive, aerospace and defense, marine, medical, telecommunications and power grid. By combining the input from the customer discovery interviews with market research and due diligence in Phase I, BSI selected the Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) as the beachhead market for initial implementation of this technology. In 2025, the Li ion battery market size in this segment is expected to be about $13 billion worldwide and $2.3 billion in North America.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/18/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Surendra&nbsp;K&nbsp;Singh</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1940056/1940056_10643400_1613671007356_techdemoslide--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1940056/1940056_10643400_1613671007356_techdemoslide--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Technology demonstration Slide\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1940056/1940056_10643400_1613671007356_techdemoslide--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Technology demonstration Slide\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Effect of BSI's safety technology in preventing thermal runaway in Li ion cells subjected to thermal abuse.
