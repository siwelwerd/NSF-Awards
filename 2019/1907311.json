 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. This project aims to understand the historical significance of host-associated microbes (microbes that live inside another organism. These include bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. By using museum collections of amphibians, the fellow will examine host-associated gut microbes over time in two regions of the United States. Amphibian museum specimens are especially useful in this regard because of the way in which these specimens were preserved. These specimens preserved fluids, which provide a snapshot of the host-associated microbes at the time of collection. This work will have important impacts on host-associated microbe ecology and evolution. Additionally, the proposed work will involve the participation of Native American students from reservations in South Dakota to expand scientific interest and careers among this underrepresented group.\r\n\r\nIt is hypothesized that microbial gut communities will vary in diversity and function both within and between amphibian assemblages over spatiotemporal gradients. Such changes may also precede disease related declines of the associated hosts, such as chytridiomycosis in amphibians. These hypotheses will be tested by utilizing recently developed techniques for isolation and purification of degraded DNA. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing will be used for generating host-associated gut metagenome data. Sequence-based taxonomic and functional analysis will be completed using a variety of bioinformatics and machine-learning software on high-performance computing resources.  By utilizing museum specimens and their associated locality information, the fellow will also explicate changes in host-associated microbiomes of amphibian assemblages in response to differential land-use and land-cover (LULC) in the Midwest and Northeast United States from the 1880s to present. Statistical mixed-effects models will be implemented for evaluating changes in host-associated microbial metagenomes and will include the integration of publicly available LULC datasets. The project will therefore further the training of the fellow in GIS for integration into microbial ecology research, and also promote the mentoring of students from underrepresented groups in using museum collections for answering questions pertaining to microbial ecology and evolution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Sequencing efficacy was completed in a study comparing a subset of specimens subjected to both 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing (Figure 3). This was an important finding as it demonstrated this method does indeed work with museum specimens, albeit with some caveats. The larger study looking at temporal trends among species was also completed, looking at various factors influencing microbial community dynamics. Changes in land-use were largely found to be unimportant due to rather stable general land-use patterns over time (for example, agrarian areas in the Midwest have remained largely agrarian over a 120 year period). Microbial community structures were found to change over time generally, however, with results indicating microbial community shifts in Midwest <em>Rana pipiens</em> populations preceding major population changes portending ongoing speciation/extirpation trends (Figures 4 &amp; 5). This is an  important finding for evolutionary ecology generally in showing that microbial community patterns may act as causal constraints toward population changes and speciation/extinction trends. As current evolutionary theory for constraint concepts is poorly developed, the Fellow undertook limited effort in this sphere to couple his findings, resulting in the conceptual development of constraint drift. This empirical and theoretical work will aid the Fellow's developing research program using museum specimens to examine the role of organism-associated microbial communities as causal factors in the emergence of evolutionary novelties and innovations (in other words, the new stuff that evolution can work with), to include cladal trends. The results of these findings have been disseminated at field specific conferences, and are also being reported as peer reviewed publications. Specifically, these results have been published, are in review, and one final paper is currently in preparation.</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;\">Broader impacts:</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;\">The Fellow was able to include both graduate students and high school students in the project as proposed.
