 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eruptive solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (or CMEs) are of critical importance for space weather forecasting.  This three-year project encompasses a number of the emerging research directions outlined in the recent \"Roadmap for Reliable Ensemble Forecasting of the Sun-Earth System\" report (Nita et al., 2018).  Additionally, the work will advance discovery, while promoting teaching, training, and learning.  Furthermore, it will enhance the infrastructure for research and education through networks and partnerships.  The project team envisions that a significant portion of the work will be carried out by a postdoctoral research scholar at the SSL of the University of California at Berkeley.  The Principal Investigator (PI) and Co-PI have experience mentoring and supervising student researchers and the location of the research -- the UC-Berkeley -- presents the opportunity to involve highly-qualified undergraduate and graduate students in space physics research.  Results from the work will be disseminated broadly as the PI, Co-PI, and postdoctoral scholar will present their results at national and international scientific meetings (including the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s SHINE Workshop), in colloquia and seminars, and publish them in peer-reviewed journals.\r\n\r\nThis three-year project will combine data analysis, modeling, and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations in order to further our numerical capabilities to model the initiation and evolution of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) on the basis of a first-principles (FP) description of the eruption processes.  The project team will examine the corona-to-heliosphere connection of CMEs via their magnetic field and plasma dynamics and the distribution and evolution of plasma heating in the ejecta material and surrounding corona during the eruption process.  The project builds upon the innovative and proven foundation of the team's prior work investigating the global structure of enhanced composition within ICMEs, which revealed an intriguing, yet unexplained statistical relationship with the geo-effectiveness of ICMEs.  The project is ideally suited for the NSF's Solar-Terrestrial Research (STR) program as it combines the study of FP CME initiation and evolution with observationally-constrained, empirical coronal heating parameterizations in order to generate modeling outputs that can be directly compared to remote and in-situ observations of coronal plasma diagnostics and CME/ICME field and plasma structures.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

CMEs are one of the most spectacular manifestations of dynamic solar activity and these eruptive transients are the primary drivers of the most severe space weather impacts on the near-Earth space environment. The project resulted in 13 scientific publications in the peer-reviewed literature and 11 presentations by the PI Dr. Benjamin Lynch and Co-PI Dr. William Abbett at the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California--Berkeley.</p>\n<p>The left panel of Figure 1 (adapted from Hoeksema et al. 2020) shows a visualization of the pre-eruptive, energized magnetic field configuration for active region NOAA 11158 that has been initialized via a numerical simulation of magnetofrictional evolution based on the observed evolution of the photospheric magnetic field. The photospheric magnetic field acts as the time-dependent boundary conditions at the bottom of the computational domain. The upper-right panel of Figure 1 shows a high-temperature emission proxy derived from the numerical simulation while the lower-right panel of Figure 1 shows the observed emission from the solar corona at a wavelength of 131 Angstroms. The overall agreement in morphological structure shows that the brightest areas are concentrated above the active region?s polarity inversion line---the narrow channel between the strong positive and negative magnetic fields. Significant progress was made in the coupling between magnetofrictional energized configurations with a more complex magnetohydrodynamic simulation code that can model the magnetic field and plasma during the CME eruption process itself.</p>\n<p>Figure 2 (adapted from Lynch et al. 2021) shows the results from a numerical simulation of the high-latitude, full-disk filament eruption that caused a large, multi-part CME on July 10, 2015 that eventually hit the Earth. Figure 2(a) shows the concentration of free magnetic energy above the filament channel polarity inversion line used to power the eruption (top) and the global energy evolution during the simulation (bottom). The rapid drop in magnetic energy leading to the rapid rise in kinetic energy is characteristic of all major CME eruptions. The yellow shaded region shows the impulsive phase of the eruptive flare. Figure 2(b) shows a comparison between the flare ribbons (footpoints of the magnetic field lines participating in the eruption) in the simulation (top) and observations (bottom), while Figure 2(c) shows the quantitative comparison between the amount of magnetic flux that erupts in the numerical model (top) and the estimates from the observations (bottom). Figure 2(d) shows the magnetic field structure and synthetic white-light emission during the CME eruption.</p>\n<p>Figure 3 (adapted from Pal et al. 2022) shows the remote-sensing and in-situ data from a multi-stage sympathetic eruption sequence that resulted in a streamer blowout CME that was observed with the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft at approximately half the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Figure 3(a) shows the on-disk and off-limb locations for the origin of the three sequential CME eruptions in the low corona. Figure 3(b) shows each of the eruptions? trajectories which include significant latitudinal deflections that arise from the magnetic field geometry above the CME source regions. Figure 3(c) shows the in-situ magnetic field and plasma data from PSP which is identified with the eruption labeled \"CME #2.\" The coherent, structured magnetic flux rope is shaded in yellow whereas the PSP crossings of the heliospheric current sheet draped around the ejecta are shaded in light gray. The interaction between the CME and the heliospheric current sheet gradually erodes the magnetic flux content, peeling off the outer layers like an onion (shaded magenta). The process of gradual flux erosion will ultimately affect the severity of the geomagnetic response from Earth-directed CMEs where the more flux erosion that occurs the less of an impact the CME structure will have.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/06/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Benjamin&nbsp;J&nbsp;Lynch</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1851945/1851945_10603965_1673032845276_PO_F1a--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1851945/1851945_10603965_1673032845276_PO_F1a--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1851945/1851945_10603965_1673032845276_PO_F1a--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
