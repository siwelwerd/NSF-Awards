 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The goal of this foundational study is to significantly improve the performance of lithium ion batteries. These batteries are among the most promising energy storage technologies and are much needed for near-term growth of the renewable energy and electric vehicle markets. This project examines how electroceramic materials (used in batteries) can be intentionally altered by adding impurities or producing other defects. For electrode (i.e., anode and cathode) materials, conductivity is critical for high energy and high-power lithium ion batteries. Recent research demonstrates improved performance when electrode materials contain defects, with the potential to extend battery energy, power density, stability, tolerance in extreme conditions, and calendar life. This project focuses on and explores the model oxide system, titania (TiO2) to shed light on the underlying conductivity phenomena in these electroceramic materials. In addition, this project is coupled to education, diversity, and training activities that are integrated across two participating universities (Boise State and Purdue). For example, this project is implementing a cross-institutional undergraduate researcher 'exchange' program.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: This study presents a unique method for tailoring ionic/electronic conductivity using irradiation, which could open new research pathways in irradiation-enhanced materials functionality and lead to an unprecedented advancement in tailoring electrochemical performance in electroceramic materials. The project investigates the hypothesis that irradiation-induced defects can provide tunable control over the mixed ionic/electronic conductivity in electroceramic materials, thus delivering enhanced electrochemical properties for lithium-ion battery applications. Electrodes containing extrinsic (e.g., doping) and intrinsic defects (e.g., vacancies, cation disorder) exhibit improved electrochemical properties. Specifically, extrinsic defects may enhance electronic conductivity, while intrinsic defects may enhance ionic conductivity. Intermediate energy ion irradiation creates intrinsic defects, while the irradiating ion species becomes implanted in the target material as extrinsic defects. Thus, it is theorized that the appropriate selection of the irradiating ion species and energy enables tuning of the ionic and electronic conductivity to produce better electrochemical properties. This project focuses on a model metal oxide, TiO2 (anatase). Specimens irradiated with niobium ions to produce both intrinsic and extrinsic defects, are compared to specimens irradiated with helium ions, which diffuse from the target material and leave behind only intrinsic defects. The hypothesis is being tested on crystalline thin films, which enables a mechanistic understanding of intermediate energy irradiation effects on metal oxides to be formed. Building on these results, research on a polycrystalline nanoarchitectured TiO2 electrode follows to elucidate the ion irradiation effect on the electrochemical properties of the electrode. This research is being incorporated into teaching and outreach modules for integration across the two participating institutions and is being made available via NanoHUB.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe demand for high-performance rechargeable batteries is skyrocketing with the growing fleet of electric vehicles, widespread use of smartphones and tablets, and emerging demand for grid storage of carbon-neutral energy (e.g., solar, wind). These batteries operate by shuffling ions (i.e., atoms having an electric charge) between a cathode material and an anode electrode material. A high-performance battery requires electrode materials to conduct both ions and electrons at reasonably fast rates. In this project, we explored the use of irradiation to change the structure of oxide anode materials, allowing us to tailor the anodes ability to conduct both ions and electric charge, and consequently improve the overall battery performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout this project, we achieved two key outcomes:\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) Understand Irradiation Effects on Anode Material Structure\n\n\n\n\n\nWe conducted irradiation of amorphous (i.e., disordered) TiO2 nanotubes, which are common anode materials. We conducted the irradiation (e.g., Kr, Xe) in situ within a transmission electron microscope, meaning we were able to observe and track the TiO2 nanotubes in real time throughout the course of irradiation. Regardless of our irradiating particle type or energy, the nanotubes consistently underwent volumetric swelling leading to the ultimate collapse of the original nanotube structure. We used molecular dynamics simulation, to show that the irradiation is causing O atoms to get knocked out from their original positions more easily than Ti atoms. These simulations also showed that heavier irradiating particles knock out O and Ti atoms from their original positions more easily than lighter irradiating particles do. The O and Ti atoms that get knocked out from their original positions in the nanotubes must find another position to move into; this process causes the observed volumetric swelling of the nanotubes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the heaviest irradiating particles also cause the amorphous TiO2 nanotube structure to partially crystallize. This amorphous-to-crystalline (a-to-c) transformation happens because the heavier irradiating particles tend to cause more of the knock out displacements of the Ti and O atoms in the nanotubes. The forced movement of the knocked out atoms within the nanotubes can trigger nearby atoms to together rearrange into a crystalline structure, which is lower in energy and more stable than the original amorphous disordered structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) Understand Electrochemical Impact of Irradiation-Induced Changes\n\n\n\n\n\nWe irradiated particles of amorphous Nb2O5 containing nanochannnels, which are also widely used battery anode materials. Subsequently, x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy were conducted to evaluate whether the overall structure and the surface structure, respectively, changed with irradiation. Both of these characterization techniques showed indications of possible short-range ordering. These could be precursors to the crystallization observed in TiO2 described in outcome #1. The irradiated Nb2O5 nanochanneled specimens were made into coin cells and cycled electrochemically. Although some irradiation conditions show poorer cycling behavior than the unirradiated control specimens, some irradiation conditions show improvements. These improvements include higher specific capacity during discharge (i.e., battery material can hold more charge), and sustained higher capacity through cycles (i.e., battery performance does not fade as quickly when one charges-discharges repeatedly). Interestingly, there seems to be a sweet spot in the irradiation conditions that cause this improved behavior. When a lighter irradiating particle is used (e.g., Kr or krypton), the performance increases with an increasing amount of irradiation (up to 1 x 1012 Kr/cm2), but eventually degrades. When a heavier irradiating particle is used (e.g., Nb or niobium), the amount of irradiation that still causes an increased performance is higher (up to 1 x 1013 Nb/cm2).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese project outcomes will enable the use of irradiation to design battery anodes with improved performance through tailoring of the structures and their ionic and electronic conductivity.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/13/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: HuiXiong\n"
