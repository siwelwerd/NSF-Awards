 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2019 NISS Writing Workshop for Junior Researchers will be held at the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) on July 28 and 30, 2019, in Denver, CO.  The participants are 25 junior researchers in statistics, biostatistics, and data science, with less than 6 years since their PhD and preference to those with less than 3 years.  The writing workshop provides individual hands-on guidance and mentoring on how to write journal articles and grant proposals.  Junior researchers are paired with senior editors as mentors.  Previous workshops have been very successful with many workshop participants going on to become associate editors or co-editors of major statistical journals.  Individuals from among the 109 graduates from 2007 to 2011, the first five years of this workshop, have held at least 23 associate editorships and one co-editorship.\r\n\r\nWriting well is a critical but often short-changed component of the education of statisticians and data scientists. The inability to write well can hinder not only publication of a researcher's results but also success with grant proposals.  Over the past several years, NISS has organized technical writing workshops for junior researchers in statistics, biostatistics and data science. The 2019 NISS writing workshop consists of two parts. The Sunday tutorial is an all-day session that covers scientific writing, as well as how to organize a paper. The workshop will cover ethical issues, writing grant proposals, strategies for journal choice, effective use of graphics, and understanding and responding to reviewers' comments.  At the end of this session, participants will meet with their mentor who analyzed a paper the participant submitted prior to JSM.  The Tuesday session focuses on specific issues for improving a manuscript.  The website for the workshop is: https://www.niss.org/events/2019-niss-writing-workshop-junior-researchers-jsm\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
