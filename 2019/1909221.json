 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet of Things (IoT) promises \"smart spaces\" that sense and respond to individuals' needs. However, today's IoT applications fall short of this grand vision. Applications are often not personalized, do not respond to dynamics, and require manual intervention and knowledge to work. This project builds a \"middleware\" that sits between a user's application and the IoT devices that the application uses. This middleware has three components necessary to the long-term vision of a personalized IoT. First, the project develops mechanisms to authenticate and authorize individuals and their applications to use devices embedded in the surroundings. This allows applications to operate even in completely new environments, without requiring the user to perform complex manual steps to set up the IoT devices. Second, the project creates algorithms and protocols to automatically select the IoT devices in the surroundings that an application should use, based on the context of an application's request, including the physical nature of the environment (e.g., the built environment or the user's movement). This allows applications to delegate the act of directly using particular IoT devices to the middleware. Third, this project constructs feedback pathways between applications and IoT devices. These pathways collect successes (and failures) of applications' uses of IoT devices. This allows both the devices and the middleware to learn and adapt over time.\r\n\r\nThe IoT is central in everyday environments. However, the state of the art prevents users from personalizing the behavior of spaces, especially spaces they do not \"own\". This project's research is on the critical path to the vision of personalized and immersive IoT experiences. To make an application's use of the IoT implicit, IoT devices must transparently and efficiently authenticate users and their applications. To avoid a global catalog of all IoT devices, applications must dynamically discover contextually-relevant IoT devices. These are key efforts in this project. To demonstrate its contributions, this project will deploy a set of micro-testbeds that will validate the results and generate a general-purpose data set for IoT applications. The project also includes student-led research projects designed to transition to museum quality interactive exhibits showcasing the potential of the IoT.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nImagine entering a room and trying to turn on the light, but the switches are in most unusual places and disguised as everyday objects, hidden in plain view. It sounds absurd, the scenario for a fictional movie. Yet, this is not far from today's reality of smart spaces made possible by advances in the Internet of Things technology. In one's own home, a user needs to install the smart devices, download apps that control the individual devices, configure the devices, connect them to the local network, write scripts to coordinate actions involving multiple devices (usually from the same manufacturer), and initiate actions when needed or based on a predefined schedule. All of this so it becomes possible to turn on the lights. Ah, but when staying at a friend's cabin in the mountains all this is for naught, given that the home contains a different set of devices, runs on a novel network, and requires a different suite of apps, etc.\n\n\nPersonalized interactions with the Internet of Things should mean that the devices recede from the user consciousness and user requests are automatically acted upon by any smart space the user might be visiting at the time. Our research accomplished the first steps in achieving this by allowing the user to interact with the space at a more conceptual level in terms of \"spatial characteristics\" such as illumination, temperature, humidity, security. Requests, in turn, are interpreted by the smart space as changes in the configuration of local available devices. User feedback and sensor readings create an opportunity for the space to improve the speed and accuracy of its responses over time, learning from experiences, whether with the same user or a set of similar users. Progress towards this goal entailed several major activities. From an engineering perspective, we proposed and realized the concept of space broker as a mediator between the abstract user interface and the available local devices; the space broker is also responsible for publishing the range of control options made available to the users via their smart devices. From a control perspective, we initiated an investigation into the types of algorithms the smart space may employ to respond to user requests and to learn from interactions with users over time. We complemented these efforts with evaluation environments built on 3D rendering engines that provide realistic perspectives on how users' experience smart spaces. In the end, our work in this project generated novel insights, fundamental advances, and new research challenges related to the integration of machine learning with our everyday spaces.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/02/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ChristineJulien\n"
