 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposium will be held at Emory University, in Atlanta in 2019, University of Georgia, in Athens in 2020, Georgia Tech, in Atlanta in 2021. The conferences will expose students, postdocs, and faculty to the latest and greatest in the field of Algebraic Geometry. The meetings will also help early career mathematicians from outside of Georgia to get to know the state and its universities. The annual event will help to significantly strengthen the ties between the members of the algebraic geometry community in Georgia and the neighboring states. The majority of funding will be used to support early career mathematicians. The organizers' goal is to provide an opportunity for them to network with each other and with senior people at the conference, and to be exposed to the cutting edge developments in the field. As has been demonstrated in the previous Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposia, the organizers are committed to supporting members of the community from underrepresented groups. At each of the past events there was a significant percentage of female speakers. In addition to the talks by invited star speakers, there will be sessions of mini-talks by early career researchers: postdocs and graduate students. \r\n\r\nSince 2012 the Principal Investigators have  been organizing an annual event called the Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposium. The first three installments were held at the University of Georgia, and the last three were a collective effort, with conferences held at Emory University, at the University of Georgia, and at Georgia Tech, which together comprise the main three research universities in Georgia. Following a well working scheme, each conference will be held over a weekend with 8-10 speakers and 80-100 participants, of which about half will be local and the other half non-local.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
