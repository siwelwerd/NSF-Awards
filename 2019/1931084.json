 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lipid membranes form the envelope surrounding the interior of biological cells. These membranes exhibit\r\nunique mechanical and electrical properties that interact in such a way as to facilitate a wide range of\r\nbiological processes. The structure of the lipid molecules that constitute these membranes imparts unusual\r\nmechanical behavior resembling that of liquid crystals, a phase of matter intermediate between conventional\r\nsolids and liquids. Another basic feature of plasma membranes is a negatively charged inner layer of lipid\r\nmolecules. These charged lipids diffuse on the membrane surface in response to physical forces. In turn,\r\ncharged lipids play a significant role in regulating the functionality of membrane-embedded protein\r\nstructures. The objective of this project is to formulate and employ mathematical and computational models\r\nto investigate electro-mechanical interactions of lipid-protein systems. Insights gained from the project will\r\nlead to improved understanding of physical processes occurring at the cellular level. This in turn is expected\r\nto enhance understanding of the mechanisms underlying lipid-associated diseases and the efficacy of drug\r\ntherapies. Thus, the project will promote the progress of fundamental science and advance national\r\npriorities in the critical area of healthcare. The project combines expertise in various branches of physics,\r\nstructural engineering and cellular biology. It will provide advanced training to a diverse group of students\r\nand thereby enhance U.S. global competitiveness by contributing to the establishment of a new generation\r\nof interdisciplinary scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide the mathematical framework to describe the fundamental interactions of charged\r\nlipids and proteins in biological membranes. It will culminate in a predictive tool for the simulation of the\r\nmicroscopic electromechanical interactions responsible for a host of cellular functions. Its novel features\r\ninclude the use of continuum theory and molecular dynamics modeling of the coupled interplay between\r\nmembrane deformation at the lipid-protein interfaces, diffusion of charged lipids and proteins, and the\r\nquantification of the role of electric fields on the behavior of the combined system. The derived framework\r\nwould also assist researchers in the mechanics and material science communities to model complex 2D\r\ninterfaces.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
