 "awd_abstract_narration": "The connections between meanings and the speech signals through which they are linguistically conveyed vary systematically and change systematically over time, not only across speech communities but crucially, within the same speech community.  Meaning in Flux 2019 is a conference, unique in the world, that showcases cutting-edge empirical and experimental research at the intersection of language variation and change dynamics and how these dynamics are driven by and/or constrained by the human cognitive architecture and by the processes of language growth that take place during human early development (early childhood through adolescence).  The specific questions of the conference are: (a) to what extent are linguistic meaning and linguistic sound dynamics construable as dynamics that emerge from and are guided by real-time implementation processes? (b) how are the actuation and propagation of these dynamics driven by discourse context and other communicative constraints? By societal pressures? (c) are there causal relations between the arcs of meaning-sound acquisition/development and change?\r\n\r\nAnswers to these questions have ramifications throughout society, such as the study of language impairments and developmental disabilities, and the understanding of individual differences as they impact language use in educational settings. It also has direct implications for our understanding of lesser understood speech communities, such as those connected to developmental disabilities (i.e. Autism), societally marginalized peoples (i.e. Black, LGBTQ+), and the Deaf Signing population. Such understanding will help demonstrate that these communities are all expected manifestations of the linguistic, cognitive, and social properties of humankind, which should inform the creation of fair economic, educational, and social policy. The conference also incorporates disciplines that are guiding the creation of new tools for speech technology and improved human-machine interaction. The inclusion for this iteration of sound and speech will only amplify the potential impact that the stimulus that the conference represents can have on these applied areas of knowledge and potentially of industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Meaning in Flux 2019: Connecting development, variation, and change NSF Final report &ndash; Submitted February 3rd 2021\n\n \n1.    Introduction\n\n \n\nMeaning in Flux 2019: Connecting development, variation, and change took place at Yale University in October 10th -12th, 2019. By all measures, it was a very successful conference which would not have been possible without NSF support. In what follows we present the various components of what was done during the conference and what learned from it, including the archival work that it produced. \n\n \n2.    Meaning in flux 2019: Description of the conference\n\nThe connections between meanings and the pronunciations through which they are linguistically conveyed vary systematically within a speech community and change systematically over time.  Many synchronic and diachronic patterns that instantiate such dynamics have been well described, yet the cognitive and communicative forces that support them&mdash;including their discourse-based, linguistic, conceptual, and cognitive components&mdash;remain poorly understood.  The focus of this conference is to bring together researchers working on one or more of these facets with the aim of connecting development, variation, and change.\n\nPresentations lay at the intersection of semantics/pragmatics, information/discourse structure, phonetics/phonology (of spoken and signed languages), language variation, language change, and language and cognitive development.  We encouraged submissions presenting in-progress results, covering not only connections between existing analyses and cognitively-grounded explanatory models but also the methodological challenges that arise. \n\n \n\nWe addressed the following questions:\n\n(a) to what extent are trajectories of meaning-pronunciation dynamics construable as dynamics that emerge from and are guided by real-time implementation of the architecture of language and the larger cognitive system?\n\n(b) how are the actuation and propagation of these dynamics driven by discourse context and other communicative constraints?\n\n(c) how are the causal relations between the arcs of acquisition/development and change in meaning-pronunciations informed by processing constraints?\n\n \n\nThe conference was organized as a kind of retreat, with discussion driven by foundational questions on meaning -pronunciation development, variation, and change, as well as the struggle of messy data.  As the program reveals we succeeded inbringing together a variety of perspectives on meaning and phonetics/phonology representation, as well as a variety of experimental and empirical approaches, as exemplified by our invited speakers. \n\n \n\nThe invited speakers (with their relevant research topics) were:\n\nSusan Carey, Harvard U. Psychology &ndash; Cognitive basis of linguistic meaning\n\nHerbert Clark, Stanford U. Psychology &ndash; Meaning development\n\nJennifer Cole, Northwestern U. Linguistics &ndash; Prosody and meaning\n\nVeneeta Dayal, Yale U. Linguistics &ndash; Semantic structure and semantic variation\n\nJoy Hirsch, Haskins Labs Psychology &ndash; Prof. Hirsch was a confirmed speaker up to a month before the conference when she asked to be excused. \n\n \n\nThe scientific committee was drawn from previous Meaning in Flux (2017) participants and other well known researchers in the various subfields that connect with the conference: \n\n \n\nClaire Bowern, Yale U.

Meaning in Flux 2019 &ndash; Motivation for the logo\n\n \n\nThe spiral is evocative of possibility and internal dynamics. [1] Like the 2017 version, we used it to manifest the running themes of the conference: development, variation and change.
