 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Automotive and Energy Research and Industrial Mentorship (AERIM) REU Site at Oakland University, is to contribute to the development of a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally-engaged science and engineering workforce, an NSF priority. This program will engage a diverse cohort of undergraduate students in research and industrial mentorship experiences focused on automotive and energy-related research as well as provide opportunities to interact with professionals from several automotive manufacturers. Both the automotive and energy industries are primary drivers of the U.S. economy, manufacturing in particular, and would benefit from the development of a highly skilled and innovative workforce. The REU students will also benefit from participation in organized STEM outreach activities in partnership with the Michigan Science Center in Detroit. \r\n\r\nThe AERIM REU Site will engage 30 undergraduate students, particularly women and under-represented minorities, in 10-week research experiences during the summers of 2019-2021. The program is designed to excite and motivate the students to pursue graduate studies and careers in science and engineering. Working with industrial and academic mentors, student teams will work on timely, automotive and energy-related research topics in mechanical engineering with a special emphasis on technologies that aim to improve performance and efficiencies of lithium-ion batteries, internal combustion engines, automotive materials, and alternative propulsion and energy systems. The research topics are of particular importance to the automotive and energy industries and will be relevant and appropriate for undergraduates. The specific topics of lightweight automotive materials, effects of fuel dilution in engine oil, lithium-ion batteries, flame propagation, and piston heat transfer are of particular importance to the automotive industry and will be appropriate for undergraduates. Students will be introduced to current problems, modern analytical, experimental and numerical methods, and will contribute to timely on-going research programs in academic and industrial research settings. Key features of this program include: a three-tier mentorship program that involves faculty, industrial mentors and graduate students; an ongoing commitment from several automotive manufacturers (e.g., GM, FCA, Ford) that includes mentorship by individuals with extensive industrial experience and access to laboratory and industrial facilities; a service learning outreach activity in partnership with the Michigan Science Center in Detroit; and learning, networking and peer support opportunities through coordinated professional activities inside and outside the university.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A total of 120 undergraduate students &ndash; about half of them women &ndash; from 82 different universities and community colleges across the United States have participated in the program since 2006. 70% of the participants were from underrepresented groups in engineering, with women representing nearly 50% of all student participants. Furthermore, in most years, 40-50% or more of the student participants had at least one parent with no college degree and 37% of the 30 student participants between 2021 and 2023 were first generation college students. Each summer, student participants worked in teams of 2-3 on automotive and energy research projects under the guidance of faculty, graduate students and often industry mentors, and also took part in other activities such as industrial research lab and facilities tours, meetings with working engineers, conferences and seminars. The primary automotive focus of this program was a natural choice given Oakland University&rsquo;s close ties to and location near the world headquarters and engineering centers of the Big-Three automakers, as well as over one hundred automotive suppliers in southeast Michigan. Our close proximity to so many companies and our long running partnerships and collaborations with many automotive companies and individuals and executives within these companies has allowed us over the years to tap into a resource for our REU program that we felt was often under-utilized: working and retired engineers and researchers from industry. Over 70 professionals from industry, varying in rank from senior vice presidents to researchers, to program directors, to young engineers, to manufacturing and lab supervisors have assisted the program at different levels since 2006. These industry professionals have volunteered to assist the REU students in a number of different ways; some provided guidance or materials for the research projects; others organized laboratory/industrial tours, gave seminars, found speakers, or simply had informal discussions with the students on a variety of topics including the automotive or energy industry, technology and career choices. This involvement of industry professionals has been one of the key features of the AERIM program as they bring with them a wealth of knowledge, recent and past experiences working in the automotive and other industries, and are able to provide the students with a &ldquo;real world&rdquo; perspective that carries a lot of weight in the eyes of students.</p>\n<p>As a result of their research experience, AERIM REU student participants reported that they learned more about mechanical engineering topics related to automotive and/or energy applications, developed a sense of how their research contributes to scientific knowledge, developed a mentor relationship with faculty on whom they can call for guidance in the future, developed their experimental and analytical skills, improved their oral communication skills and self confidence. All of the students have gone on to to give conference presentations, hence assisting in the dissemination of their research findings to the engineering community. The REU experience has also played an important role in motivating the students to pursue graduate degrees and careers in science and engineering, hence contributing to the development of a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally-engaged science and engineering workforce, an NSF priority. Longitudinal assessment of the program shows that while between 10% and 44.4% of the 90 students who took part in the REU program between 2006 and 2016 indicated plans to go to graduate school in the pre-REU surveys, between 62.5% and 90% applied to a graduate degree program and between 37.5% and 90% have either enrolled in or completed one or more graduate degrees (depending on the year), representing over 77% of the student participants. All of the former participants who are not currently in school work in STEM fields, except for one participant who went on to earn a law degree and is now an associate focused on patent law and IP at a big law firm.
