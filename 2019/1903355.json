 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stars, galaxies, and nebulae in the universe consist of matter in a plasma state.  Magnetic fields dramatically impact properties of plasma. Magnetic fields are thought to be responsible for catastrophic cosmic events such as generation of super-strong x-ray bursts by collapsing stars and explosion of solar flares.  Understanding of plasma in strong magnetic fields is important for astrophysics, basic plasma physics, and energy and national defense applications. A unique combination of the Mega-Ampere current generator and powerful short-pulse laser at the University of Nevada, Reno allows to investigate plasmas in magnetic fields that are millions of times stronger that the Earth's magnetic field.  In this project, the impact of strong magnetic fields on high-energy beams of electrons, and proton beams generated by the powerful laser in a solid target will be studied.  In collaboration with the University of Rochester, three graduate students will be trained and will perform experimental and theoretical work.\r\n\r\nElectron transport in the solid laser target will be studied in the axial magnetic field of 1-1.5 MGauss. The pulsed power generator provides well measured and controlled magnetic fields. Coherent transient radiation from the rear side of the target will illuminate a spot of the electron beam and indicate a guiding and focusing effect in the magnetic field. Enhanced generation of proton beams in the external magnetic field will be studied with the same experimental configuration combining laser and pulsed power capabilities. A \"proof of principle\" experiment will be performed at the magnetic field of ~1.5 MGauss. The experimental program will be supported by simulations of electron and proton beams in a strong longitudinal magnetic field using hybrid particle-in-cell codes.  Results of the project are relevant to the \"fast ignition\" approach to inertial confinement fusion and for medical applications.  This project is jointly funded by the Division of Physics and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
