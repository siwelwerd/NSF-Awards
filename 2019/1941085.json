 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficient cyberinfrastructure (advanced computing, data, software and networking infrastructure) is a critical component of the support that NSF provides for new discoveries in science and engineering. Cyberinfrastructure is complex and traditionally requires years of human hand-tuning to fully achieve maximal performance for scientific users.  We propose to introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a way to automatically and quickly optimize the performance and broadest use of recent NSF-supported advanced computing resources. Through this pilot effort our ultimate aim is to enable and accelerate scientific advances in widely diverse fields such as biology, chemistry, oceanography, materials science, climate modeling, and cosmology.\r\n\r\nAs the research cyberinfrastructure grows rapidly in scale and complexity, it is essential to integrate new technologies based on Machine Learning (ML) and AI to ensure that the investments in new hardware and software components result in proportional improvements in performance and capability. This project will undertake a transformative research activity targeting: (1) scaling ML algorithms to make them easily available to the scientific community; and (2) improving cyberinfrastructure efficiency through AI-based predictive models. This technical work will be complemented and informed by a community engagement effort to jointly catalog the state of the art and identify future challenges and opportunities in enabling a new smart cyberinfrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A steering committee of domain experts and CI community representatives led the organization of the workshop. The Steering committee members were as follows: Ilkay Altintas, Jose Fortes, Ian Foster, Helen Gu, Salim Hariri, Valerio Pascucci (PI and Chair), Dan Stanzione, Michela Taufer, and Xinyu Zhao.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Workshop attendance was by invitation only and consisted of 60 participants, including AI/ML experts, domain scientists and engineers, representatives from the National Science Foundation (NSF), CI professionals, and representatives from NSF-funded computing facilities. The workshop's overarching goal was to develop a community view of the state of the art and research needed in the use of scientific cyberinfrastructure to advance AI technologies and how to use these technologies to manage NSF-sponsored cyberinfrastructure efficiently.&nbsp;<br /><br />The scale and high priority of AI research activities and opportunities call for the urgent and coherent development of a smart cyberinfrastructure that enables accelerated progress, shared outcomes, workforce training, and operational excellence. Developing a shared research vision allows us to identify the most crucial gaps in existing capabilities that are least likely to be filled by industry or existing efforts by NSF or other agencies. The pre-workshop activities involved an assessment of the state of the art via white papers that were collected and summarized by the steering committee. The 35 responses with white paper submissions were shared with the attendees prior to the workshop and made available to the general public through the workshop website. The workshop agenda was designed to maximize the interactions among the participants with six active breakout sessions and four panel discussions, in addition to questions and feedback during three keynote and nine plenary presentations, as well as thirteen lightning talks.&nbsp;<br /><br />Based on the content of the white papers, the discussions were primarily focused on the following four themes:<br />1. exploring and assessing the cyberinfrastructure requirements for AI/ML-based scientific applications,<br />2. accelerating AI/ML algorithms on NSF-enabled cyberinfrastructure,<br />3. promoting the efficient use of NSF-enabled cyberinfrastructure through AI/ML technologies,<br />4. enabling easy and productive access to AI/ML tools by a large community of domestic and international science stakeholders.<br /><br />Overall, the enthusiastic engagement of all participants made the workshop a successful forum for open discussions, with a broad spectrum of perspectives from all stakeholders. A report was released to document and organize the wealth of information provided by the participants before, during, and after the workshop. Additional details can be found at http://smartci2020.org/.
