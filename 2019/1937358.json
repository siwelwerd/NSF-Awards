 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1\r\nHosting its 91st Annual Conference with a theme \"Preparing the Next Generation of Technical Leaders for the New Global Economy\", the The National Technical Association (NTA)continues to be the voice for equal opportunity, access, diversity, inclusion and leadership in science, technology, engineering and mathematics matters and interests in the U.S. NTA partnering with the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Geosciences Working Group is an expression of its reach and insight to the untapped resources of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The workshop plans for 50 participants, including representatives of NSF and a broad cross-section of academic, federal and community stakeholders. The Broader impact of the workshop is to promote collaborative, interdisciplinary, culturally relevant and intergenerational perspectives that help build and sustain transformative STEM education and career pathways. It will also encourage a greater commitment to building opportunities for strategic university/community-based initiatives at the faculty, undergraduate and graduate levels. Finally, the workshop will strengthen HBCU networking capacity that will directly and indirectly promote inclusion and diversity across STEM/Geosciences.\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\nThe proposed workshop seeks to continue the conversation on the NTA-HBCU Geosciences collaborative strategic action plan. This collaboration, between the community-based NTA and the campus-based HBCU Geoscience Working Group (HBCU GWG), is an untapped resource for broadening participation in STEM through a local, regional and national effort. This workshop will provide a forum to convene HBCU Geosciences and other STEM stakeholders to build on the recent 2018 Hampton University NTA-HBCU geosciences workshop and recommendations; facilitate collaborative efforts and establish a geoscience agenda that contributes to broadening participation; and formalize the HBCU Geosciences Action Plan and assign responsibilities with a timeline for execution.\r\nThe objectives of the 2019 HBCU Geosciences workshop are to:\r\n- Share the progress and update on NSF Geopaths Grant Award: Expanding HBCU Pathways for Geoscience Education - Sue Ebanks, PI;\r\n- Share the research findings of the NSF InTeGrate Subaward: Impacts of InTeGrate Geoscience Modules on HBCU students - Richard Schulterbrandt Gragg, PI;\r\n- Identify, explore and discuss the collaborative role of NTA and HBCU-GWG in addressing and implementing the NSF?f 10 BIG IDEAS; and\r\n- Continue the conversation on the NTA-HBCU Geosciences Collaborative Strategic Action Plan.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
