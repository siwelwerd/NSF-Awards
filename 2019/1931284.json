The workshop will bring together aspiring CSR investigators with the goal of familiarizing them with the scope and scale of CSR activities, the process of putting together compelling projects, suitably describing their research, development, education, and outreach goals, and focus on reproducibility and sustained impact. The workshop will also familiarize attendees with crosscutting programs with major CSR components. \r\n\r\nThe workshop attendees will be drawn from diverse backgrounds, including those from Historically Black Colleges and Universities  (HBCU), Minority Educational Institutions (MEI) and other underrepresented groups. The workshop is scheduled for June 20-21, 2019, at the National Science Foundation (NSF) Headquarters in Virginia. The workshop program will include presentations by NSF personnel on various CSR programs/ solicitations, successful CSR investigators on the process of putting together compelling proposals, and a session on the NSF panel review process. Workshop attendees also have open time for questions with the CSR program staff.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
