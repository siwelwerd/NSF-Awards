 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year research project aims to provide an essential framework of knowledge about the physical mechanisms of particle energization that will likely be needed to make a definitive determination of the heating mechanism of the solar corona.  Furthermore, fundamental insights into the multi-scale problem of particle energization in magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence -- a major goal of the research project -- will lead to an improved ability to achieve the societal goal of predicting the impacts of extreme space weather events, in particular the acceleration of hazardous solar energetic particles by these mechanisms.\r\n\r\nPlasma turbulence and magnetic reconnection are two grand challenge problems in heliophysics, and the overlap and interplay of these two incompletely understood mechanisms represents an important frontier for heliophysics research.  This three-year research project targets a major unanswered question on this frontier, namely: to what extent does magnetic reconnection play a role in the dissipation of plasma turbulence at small scales?  In order to make progress in answering this fundamental question, during this project magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence simulations will be performed using both the AstroGK and Gkeyll kinetic simulation codes.  The project teams will investigate the particle energization using a guiding-center analysis and a pressure tensor calculation, along with a single-point field-particle correlation analysis to determine the characteristic velocity-space signatures of specific energization mechanisms associated with collisionless magnetic reconnection.  Finally, these signatures will be sought in the turbulent magnetosheath plasma by analyzing the electromagnetic field and particle velocity distribution function measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission.\r\n\r\nThis three-year project will support the education and Ph.D. thesis research of a graduate student in space plasma physics at the University of Iowa.  Furthermore, a refined implementation of the novel field-particle correlation technique to the analysis of particle energization in heliospheric plasmas can be subsequently applied to understand the fundamentals of plasma heating and particle acceleration in space and astrophysical plasmas due to turbulence, reconnection, or collisionless shocks; this is a major goal of the heliophysics community as outlined by the 2013 NRC Heliophysics Decadal survey.  The research results obtained during the project will be disseminated broadly through presentations to the scientific community at national and international meetings and publication in the peer-reviewed literature.  Elements of this research will be incorporated into public outreach events for school audiences of all ages as well as public lectures on plasma physics, astrophysics, and space physics.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project aimed to explore how plasma turbulence and magnetic reconnection are interconnected, specifically addressing the unanswered question of whether magnetic reconnection will arise naturally in a turbulent space plasma to remove energy from the turbulence and thereby heat the plasma or accelerate particles to high energy.\n\n\n\nThis project used the new and innovative field-particle correlation technique, which employs single-point measurements of the electromagnetic field and particle velocity distributions (measurements that can be made using existing spacecraft instrumentation) to identify the processes that govern the particle energization as turbulence is dissipated. The project used cutting-edge supercomputer simulations of magnetic reconnection to identify the velocity-space signature of particle energization due to magnetic reconnection, essentially a unique fingerprint of the process that transfers energy from the electromagnetic fields to the particles. This unique signature can then be sought in supercomputer simulations of plasma turbulence and in spacecraft observations of the turbulence that pervades near-Earth space.\n\n\n\nThis project yielded several successful outcomes as well as two unexpected findings. First, we successfully identified the velocity-space signature of magnetic reconnection under various plasma conditions typically found in near-Earth space. By performing several complementary analyses of how electrons gain energy in magnetic reconnection, we discovered the unexpected result that the picture of how the electrons gain energy looks different if you follow electrons along their individual trajectories versus if you consider how the entire distribution of electrons gains energy. Seeking the velocity-space signatures of magnetic reconnection in a suite of numerical simulations of plasma turbulence, we surprisingly found no velocity-space signatures that matched the expectation for magnetic reconnection. Instead, the field-particle correlation technique enabled us to discover that the energy of the plasma turbulence was removed by a combination of two other mechanisms: Landau damping and transit-time damping. In Landau damping, charged particles (protons or electrons) are accelerated by the electric field of the wave-like turbulent fluctuations, much as a surfer gains energy by accelerating down the face of an ocean wave.
