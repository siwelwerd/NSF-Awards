 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Oakland University to acquire a Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) machine to support and enhance multidisciplinary research and educational programs at the institution. The FACS machine will allow undergraduate/graduate students and faculty to participate in research and educational activities that will enhance the mission of the Departments of Biological Sciences and Chemistry as well as the Eye Research Institute. Specifically, the FACS machine will allow for hands-on collaborative research in the areas of amphibian biology, cancer biology, chemistry, DNA repair, developmental biology, immunology, molecular biology, plant genomics, and stem cell biology.  The instrument will be incorporated into the science and bioengineering curriculums, as part of teaching laboratories and design projects, and will allow for new course development. This instrument will also allow for student and faculty recruitment and provide a sophisticated service technology to the surrounding region.\r\n\r\nFlow cytometry combined with cell sorting enables characterizing, defining and sorting of different cell types and subpopulations by analyzing the expression of cell-surface and intracellular molecules.  Among some specific projects in which this instrument will be used are the determination of basic biological functions and signaling directed by cell surface proteins in stem cells, the role of endothelial cells on anti-apoptotic pathways, the regulation of pre-mRNA processing in plants, the effects of temperature in amphibian immunology, the development of tubular organs, and basic understanding of DNA repair mechanisms.  Results from the research using the instrument will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications, scientific meeting and to the community throughout outreach activities in which faculty of this institution participate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
