 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glaciers occur in mountains across the globe. Water from melting glaciers is important to humans and other organisms. Some of this water goes directly to streams while some will flow deep into the ground and refill groundwater. It is not known how much melt-water goes directly to streams versus to groundwater. This project uses water chemistry and biological data to determine where the water goes when a glacier melts. The project examines water from glaciers on Mt. Hood in Oregon and from glaciers in Glacier National Park in Montana. This project is training graduate students and multiple undergraduate students. The results are presented at scientific meetings and to water managers. The results are also available to the public via pamphlets and news articles.   \r\n\r\nMore than ninety percent of the Earth's alpine glaciers are in retreat and many of these glaciers will melt completely within this century. Very little research has been conducted on the impacts of alpine glacial meltwater to recharge and flow within the mountain block. This project seeks to identify the contribution of alpine glacial meltwater to mountain recharge relative to seasonal snow and rain using chemical and biological approaches. This research tests the following hypotheses: 1) The glacial environment selects for unique biota resulting in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fingerprints in alpine glacial meltwater that are distinct from seasonal snow and rain;  2) Alpine glacial meltwater is a significant source of mountain recharge and sustains perennial flow to local and regional-scale springs located down-gradient of alpine glaciers. This research assesses the novel application of DNA as a tracer for mountain recharge and increases the ability to detect recharge from alpine glaciers located in different geologic and geographic settings.  This study trains graduate students and multiple undergraduate researchers and engages with water managers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
