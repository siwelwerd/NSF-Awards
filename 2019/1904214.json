 "awd_abstract_narration": "Policy changes in the past ten years ? such as women?s admission into combat roles, and new accommodations for ethnic and religious minorities-- have brought questions about military identity to the forefront of national conversation. These policies allow for soldiers to express their individual identities; however, they also challenge popular conceptions of soldiers, raising concerns and possible conflict. This project examines how larger trends of resocialization and accommodation play out in the day-to-day lives of new soldiers. The project investigates the experiences of incoming cadet candidates at the United States Military Academy Preparatory School in West Point (USMAPS). The project examines how USMAPS works to (re)socialize cadet candidates into soldiers and future officers, and how cadet candidates, whose civilian identities are constrained by a regimented institutional context, re-fashion personal self-definitions and routines.  The project will study how cadets interpret and respond to this re-socialization as they prepare for future military service.  The findings will contribute to understanding of how the military and other modern institutions socialize new participants to develop human capital suitable to new institutional roles.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project uses ethnographic fieldwork, in-depth interviews, and quantitative text analysis to address questions regarding socialization into the military.  The fieldwork involves participating in cadet candidate academic, physical, character and military development training. The project will conduct over 100 interviews with cadet candidates from a variety of social backgrounds, as well as additional interviews with staff. The project will also include forty hometown visits to observe cadet candidate behavior outside of the institutional setting, to see their neighborhoods, and interview family members about how they perceive the cadet candidate career choices and any changes they have noticed in behavior.  The project also employs quantitative text analysis to study contemporary and historical documents related to the integration of women and minorities at West Point and in the U.S. military.  Project findings will contribute to sociological literatures on organizations, diversity and culture, particularly as they relate to re-socialization into critical U.S. institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Project findings will contribute to sociological literatures on organizations, diversity and culture, particularly as they relate to re-socialization into critical U.S. institutions.\n\n\n Theortical Impact\n\nThe project developed scholarship on institutional control and power by providing ethnographic evidence of how total institutions reshape residents--transitioning from abstract, theoretical ideas about these topics to the study of them in the everyday lives of real soldiers. Embodiment scholars understand what happens to identity when adults voluntarily change their bodily practices, but they have not yet explored this question when the changes are being controlled by another actor. The study detailed how recruits experienced being forced to change their bodily techniques. The focus on inequality demonstrated how resocialization is not a homogenous process as explained by existing scholarship. Nor is it bound by a single identity characteristic. The project illuminated how identity attributes emerge and interact upon entrance to a new setting. \n\nGlobal Impact\n\nBeyond its theoretical contributions, the project has significant implications for policy design. Conflicting identities in institutional settings can produce irreparable conflict when knowledge about the dynamics of identity formation is slim. On a local level, the study illuminates the challenges that minority groups face during their resocialization into soldiers and provides military institutions with possible strategies to (a) harmonize institutional guidelines and the needs of minority soldiers navigating the setting; and (b) provide personnel with ideas for mutually beneficial engagement. The fieldsite has already leveraged the project's findings to create informed policies in real time that may improve the current and future cadets\u2019 experiences at West Point. Graduating soldiers will carry resulting cultural changes and practices forward in their roles as the next generation of officers in the United States Army.\n\nUncovering challenges that exist for minority soldiers at a military institution addresses questions of diversity and inclusion in the Armed Forces writ large. There remains value in improving conditions for minorities in the military because these soldiers often have better outcomes than their civilian counterparts. Participation in the Armed Forces additionally provides an avenue for citizenship for permanent residents. Given that the military holds immense control over the physical and verbal actions of its employees, new policies have the potential to create rapid and pervasive change. Developing policies that foster diversity and inclusion in the Armed Forces may not only improve the day-to-day experience of minorities in the military, but also radiate change into civilian society.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/01/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Taylor P Winfield"
