 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides participant support to the Annual New York State Regional Graduate Mathematics Conference (ANYSRGMC) for the next three years. The 2019 conference is held at Syracuse University on Saturday, March 23, 2019.  This conference presented an opportunity for graduate students in New York State and surrounding regions to come together, share current research, and interact with other graduate students in a similar phase of their academic career.  Opportunities to speak at conferences are an essential part of training future mathematicians.  Unlike other graduate student mathematics conferences in the region, at the ANYSRGMC graduate students in all areas of mathematics have an opportunity to present their research.  In many cases this is the first time a graduate student will speak at a conference, giving them a valuable opportunity to learn how to structure and deliver a talk.  In addition, given the broad range of topics covered, graduate students have the opportunity to learn about other research going on in the region, as well be exposed to areas of mathematics that they are less familiar.  NSF funding increased access to this conference, giving graduate students with fewer financial resources available to them an opportunity to take advantage of this conference.\r\n \r\nThe ANYSRGMC is a one-day conference, the majority of which consists of 30 minute graduate student talks given in parallel sessions.  There are two invited guest speakers, an opening address on Saturday morning and a Keynote address Saturday afternoon.  The two speakers are typically prominent mathematicians in two distinct areas of mathematics who can speak to the diverse interests of the graduate students at Syracuse University and surrounding regions.  In addition to hearing interesting mathematics, students have the opportunity to meet and learn from successful mathematicians outside of their home universities.  Breaks between the talks gave graduate students a chance to interact with each other, potentially leading to new collaborations.  The website for the conference is at http://mgo.syr.edu/conferences-talks/conference/upcoming-conferences .\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
