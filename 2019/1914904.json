 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for 12-20 students from U.S.-based academic institutions to attend and participate in the 45th International Conference on Very Large, held in Los Angeles, California, USA, August 26-30, 2019. VLDB, started in 1975 and is the premier international database conference, held annually. Different countries ranging from China to India, Germany, Brazil and USA have hosted VLDB and the conference provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange and share results, providing tremendous opportunities for technological and entrepreneurial innovation. VLDB 2019 has a separate but equally prestigious research and industry tracks for the papers, more than ten timely workshops to co-locate with VLDB, and includes a Ph.D. workshop track that attracts students in their early career phase and allows the open discussion of their research ideas. The VLDB conference thus contributes directly to training the next generation of scientists who are both consumers and developers of technology in database management system design and implementation. The student support will have direct impact in creating a highly-qualified workforce who can take on the emerging data science challenges of the future.\r\n\r\nVLDB conference introduced numerous influential concepts such as \"Big Data\", \"Data Science\", and \"Cloud\" computing. For almost half a century and after an explosive growth in the computing industry, VLDB remains the home for the latest cutting-edge research and industrial innovation in the data arena.  The aims of the conference are multi-fold: (1) provide an international forum for sharing research results related to the investigation of major challenges in next-generation database research; (2) stimulate interactive discussions on research in the database area through panels, posters, tutorials, student scholar roundtables, etc.; (3) to motivate and engage future generations of researchers via the many conference and workshop presentations, interactive poster sessions, and panel and breakout sessions.  VLDB highly cited papers are published in The Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment (PVLDB).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
