 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Planning Grants for Engineering Research Centers competition was run as a pilot solicitation within the ERC program. Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research. \r\n\r\nAutonomous vehicles (AVs) inspire visions of new urban landscapes, broad changes in transportation patterns, and energy-efficiency. AVs are increasingly expected to be able to handle events and situations safely with little to no human assistance and intervention. As AVs become more commonplace, outside of the laboratory, AVs should conform to societal norms and improve daily life. This project enables the planning of a transdisciplinary research center to explore new concepts for a safe, autonomous, transportation engineering future. \r\n\r\nThis project develops a strategy for creating a transdisciplinary engineering, research and education center, and developing a detailed road map for safe future transportation system. The approach for the center encourages a broader perspective for examining the role AVs in society, for developing effective regulations, for urban transportation planning, and for pragmatic demonstrations of AV technology. The center integrates various perspectives, including ethics, law, communications, and the social sciences.  It explores the convergence of technologies for safe behaviors in AVs using, e.g., machine intelligence, generally driven by computer science, with specific sensors, models and methods, and vehicle engineering that has focused on vehicle systems' dynamics and controls, generally driven by physical models. The center integrates test beds into center-scale experimental platforms to demonstrate autonomous ground vehicles, autonomous aerial vehicles, including multiple connected vehicles, and future concept prototypes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNew science and new engineering practices are needed to make autonomous vehicles inherently safe.  Pragmatically, this requires foundational knowledge about safety in complex, dynamic, inter-connected systems, as well as new technologies capable of the broad forms of adaptivity and interactivity required of autonomous vehicles.  Conceptually, this also requires convergence not only within engineering and science disciplines, but also between these disciplines and the representations of societal concerns in law, policy and communication. \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nCurrent design of autonomous vehicles predominantly focuses on nominal performance in a defined range of conditions, leaving the autonomous vehicle?s behavior incomplete in actual operation.  Thus, a different intellectual approach is required.  Commercial air transport (with manned aircraft) has achieved an unparalleled level of safety by addressing multiple aspects of safety.  The first focuses on reliability, i.e., eliminating failure modes, corresponding to a definition of safety as the absence of hazards.  The next approach, termed here as robustness, assumes that hazards will still happen and thus emphasizes multiple layers of defense to trap them, rather than letting them evolve into an accident.  More-recent approaches to maintaining safety define resilience as the ability efficiently to adjust to harmful influences rather than to shun or resist them, and to recognize and adapt to handle unanticipated perturbations that call into question the model [underlying the design itself], and demand a shift of processes, strategies and coordination.  To date, such resilient adaptability in vehicles is provided by human operators, framing significant challenges with autonomous vehicles: the need for new forms of adaptability and of interactivity with all other agents in the transportation system, both human and machine.  These challenges require a hitherto undeveloped ability for contextual understanding and awareness by autonomous systems, and a broad view of the system.\n\nFurther, society?s expectations for autonomous vehicles demand not only that they be ?safe? in the abstract: the definition of safe operation must be framed specifically relative to legal and policy constructs, and communicable with those interacting with the vehicle as operators, passengers, or bystanders.  Thus, autonomous vehicle design must cut across disciplinary boundaries between the designers of physical vehicle systems, of the algorithms and software that define system behavior in operation, and of the regulatory, legal and communication functions in society: Engineers and computer scientists must change their intellectual framing of autonomous vehicle design to account for these societal frameworks.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nAt the societal level, this planning grant supported development of a vision spanning the knowledge and methods needed for society to make informed decisions about the implementation of autonomous vehicles, particularly including safety deliberately and in a manner that directly relates technologies to societal concerns.  This informed decision making will help prevent both the overly-optimistic application of autonomous vehicles (i.e., allowing safety concerns to manifest in accidents), and the overly-conservative review of new technologies (i.e., limiting their application or demanding expensive, lengthy regulatory reviews).  This benefit will then enable the many complex benefits of autonomous vehicles, including changing the urban environment (and mobility of rural populations), and allowing novel vehicles using cleaner energy sources and distribution.  This deliberate consideration of safety will also then generalize to other related technologies, including robotics, artificial intelligence, and intelligent systems, as implemented in many other systems.\n\nThis broader impact will be enabled by bringing together multiple perspectives across disciplines (within and beyond engineering) into new methods of research, system design, and workforce development.  Thus, this project enabled team building activities, including an open workshop fostering, first, ideation and, second, reflection to identify new approaches and themes by which we can approach our vision.  In particular, we used this project to organize our team.  This included identifying new partners in general who share this vision and provide unique insights convergent across disciplines, with a particular focus also on expanding the reach of our effort to involve a minority-serving institute and other partners in workforce development and technology transfer.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Amy R Pritchett"
