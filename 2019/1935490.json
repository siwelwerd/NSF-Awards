 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses funds, under the auspices of the EArly Concept Grant For Exploratory Research (EAGER) program, to focus on ways to take advantage of recent advances in mass spectrometry and data analysis in order to produce quantitative measures of temperature and precipitation from the paleoclimate record.\r\n\r\nAn initial analytical finding suggests that the 88Strontium/86Strontium ratio in carbonates is sensitive to changes in temperature.  This ideal relationship has been found to be complicated by limited experimental data that suggest that other factors, such as growth kinetics may play a role in this value.  The researcher made some initial measurements using high temperature and low temperature carbonates and the data are encouraging to the extent that there seems to be a strong relationship between 88Strontium/86Strontium and temperature.  There is no data on hand, however, to convincingly demonstrate temperature dependence in the range of temperature relevant for paleoclimate.  \r\n\r\nRecent advances in thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) coupled with the \"double spike\" method could allow enough accuracy and precision to test the idea.  In addition, stalagmites from Fort Stanton Cave that grew through the full climate swings that took place from the Last Glacial to the Early Holocene are ideal for analysis and are in-hand.  The Strontium isotopic work will be attempted in a laboratory that houses a new generation of amplifier that would make it possible to obtain very accurate and precise 88Strontium/86Strontium ratios, sufficient to resolve potential changes in temperature at a scale relevant for paleoclimate.  The researcher will also work on the design of a sample chamber that can accommodate long stalagmite samples.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the project that holds promise is the combined technical achievements in high-throughput and high-quality elemental data using newer excimer lasers coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) instruments and new ways to look at data using machine learning. Initial results by the researcher show that some trace elements, especially alkali and alkali-earth elements, may coherently vary with stable isotopes, thus providing the multidimensional data needed for machine learning applications.  \r\n\r\nThe activities are scientifically important and fit well into the potentially transformative, high-risk but potential high payoff research attributes of the EAGER program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur ability to make predictions about climate change depend on data from past climate change (paleoclimate).  Among these data temperature and precipitation are the most important.  Unlike precipitation for which we have a number of robust indicators, getting absolute temperature from the past, beyond the instrumental and tree ring chronologies has remained a daunting challenge.  This is particularly true for continental interiors.  The goal of this project was to test the possibility of using variations in the isotopes of strontium (Sr), in particular the 88Sr/86Sr ratio as a thermometer.  There were early indications it might be so, but subsequent work had shown that the system is prone to non-temperature effects for samples that have large growth rate variations.  In addition, measuring the 88Sr/86Sr ratio with the required accuracy and precision to make it useful as a thermometer were challenging.\n\nWe modified published column chemistries and analytical procedures to fit our lab that allow us to obtain 88-Sr/86-Sr ratios with uncertainties as low as 5 parts per million (2-sigma) using our multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer at the University of New Mexico.  Results from this project show that for relatively slow growing carbonate deposits where growth rates are similar, it is possible to obtain temperatures from carbonate samples that had formed from very hot fluids (&gt; 90 0C) to those that formed during glacial periods in caves.  We were able to validate our findings using two techniques.  For hot temperature samples we had obtained temperatures from fluids trapped in crystal voids (fluid inclusion).  For the low temperature samples, that are of interest for paleoclimate, we used carbon-oxygen \"clumped\" isotope (mass 47) paleothermometry. This was an effort of cross-validation because such data for cave deposits are rare.  \n\nWe will be seeking further funding to refine the method and obtain temperatures from periods that correspond to the large shifts seen in the polar ice core data.  These preliminary results will be submitted for publication soon.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yemane Asmerom"
