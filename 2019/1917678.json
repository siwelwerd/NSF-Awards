 "awd_abstract_narration": "The capability to accurately and continuously monitor physiological parameters (e.g. pressures) in body organs enables effective management of many chronic diseases, as the world is ageing rapidly. In the year 2010, US already had 40.3 million people aged 65 and older (accounting for 13 percent of total population). The ratio is projected to reach 20.9 percent by 2050. In this research, a novel class of wireless biomedical implants will be investigated for sensitive, long-term monitoring of physiological parameters in human bodies, needed for managing chronic diseases (e.g. eye disease, heart failure, or brain injury), and for improving patients' quality of life. Battery-free implantable sensors have been growing rapidly in clinical uses because they have advantages of zero power consumption, potentially allowing for long-lifetime and maintenance-free operation. Nonetheless, one of the primary challenges for these implantable sensors lies in how to accurately and robustly detect physiological parameters from electrically-lossy small sensors using radio-frequency (RF) signals. The proposed parity-time (PT)-symmetric wireless sensor system will enable new ways to manipulate the RF interrogation between the implantable microsensor and the external reader, aiming to realize wireless sensing and detection with high sensitivity, high sensing resolution, and large modulation depth. The educational impact of this proposed project will also be significant. The integrated outreach program will be effective due to the visually appealing nature of micro-/nano-devices, sensors, and circuits. The PIs will develop new courses and outreach activities in Michigan Science Center and Wayne State University's established channels, including ReBUILDetroit Program and Richard Barber Interdisciplinary Research Program, for recruiting under-represented minorities in the Detroit area.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research project is to experimentally demonstrate the generalized PT-symmetry theory in RF and microwave electronics, as well as their envisaged applications in high-performance wireless sensors. The sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the passive wireless micro-/nano-sensors are often hindered by low modal quality factor (Q-factor), due to the limited space and power dissipations associated with the skin effect, dielectric losses, eddy currents, and etc. The concept of PT-symmetry (spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetry) was first discovered in quantum theory, and has recently become an active research area in fundamental physics, including optics, acoustics, and electromagnetism. A telemetry system with its equivalent-circuit topology obeying the PT-symmetry has not yet been investigated for biotelemetry and wireless sensing applications (13.56 MHz - low GHz). This new telemetry system, although having a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, may exhibit purely real eigenfrequencies that lead to sharp and deep resonances, with the effective quality factor (Q-factor) beyond limitations for passive systems, in which conventional loop-antenna is deployed as a reader. A sharp, narrowband reflection peak has been a long-sought goal for telemetric sensor systems, because of its substantial implications for superior detection and low cumulative noises. If successful, the proposed PT-symmetric wireless sensor system will resolve the long-standing problem of low Q-factor and limited sensitivity in wireless microelectromechanical and nanotechnological sensors, composed of inductor-capacitor (LC) resonators with miniaturized footprints. This proposed research will advance fundamental knowledge in biomedical implants, wearable electronics, medical diagnosis, healthcare internet of things (IoT), microwave imaging, wireless communication, and non-Hermitian PT-symmetric physics.",

These non-Hermitian open systems share a common feature, that is, there are branch points (i.e., exceptional points or EPs) at which Taylor series expansion fails to converge in the multi-valued complex eigenspectrum. In this project, we have theoretically and experimentally demonstrated the PT-symmetric wireless sensing and telemetry systems that exploit the eigenvalue bifurcation effect to achieve unprecedentedly high sensitivity and resolvability. In 2018-2021, our team successfully demonstrated this concept with different types of practical (in-vivo) wireless sensors, including intraocular pressure (IOP) sensors and intraocular pressure sensors (Nature Electronics <strong>1</strong>, 297 (2018); IEEE Sensors Journal <strong>18</strong>, 9548 (2018); IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement <strong>70</strong>, 1 (2021)), which can be wirelessly read with high sensitivity and a sub-mmHg resolution, far exceeding the existing wireless interrogation techniques. Furthermore, for the first time, we observed the parity-time-reciprocal scaling (PTX)-symmetric Hamiltonian, which shares the same eigenspectrum with PT-symmetric Hamiltonian, but different eigenmodes. We have also applied the PT-symmetric telemetry concept to build contactless, high-precision measurement of displacement, lift-off distance, position, and vibration (IEEE Trans. Antennas Propag. <strong>67</strong>, 3445 (2019)). In 2019, we experimentally observed the divergent form of exceptional point (i.e., divergent exceptional point or DEP) in the third-order PT-symmetric electronic system and applied such divergent singularity to enhance the performance of sensor telemetry. This is the first experimental observation of DEP in PT systems, and the results were published in Phys. Rev. Lett. <strong>123</strong>, 193901 (2019). We also designed and implemented robust and misalignment-insensitive wireless power transmission systems based on the third-order PT-symmetric circuit, of which a real-valued, coupling-invariant and constant eigenfrequency enables the robust and efficient wireless charging without altering the operating frequency or adaptive impedance matching (Phys. Rev. Research <strong>2</strong>, 013152 (2019)). This new wireless power transmission technique may provide reliable, fast and efficient power delivery for a variety of consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and medical devices. In the same vein, we also exploited the bifurcation effect in the exact PT-symmetry phase to achieve the compact dual- and tri-band wireless power/data transmission, with high transmission efficiency in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands. (IEEE J. Electromagn. RF Microw. Med. Biol. <strong>6</strong>, 196 (2022)). Our findings on the high-performance wireless power transmission were published in and. In 2020, we proposed ultrasensitive monochromatic sensors based on the self-dual singularity, coherent perfect absorber-laser (CPAL) point, in the broken-PT phase. The CPAL-based sensors use radio waves, microwaves, terahertz radiations, or light to readout the extremely small-scale perturbations of impedance or refractive index caused by, for example, low-density gas molecules and microscopic properties. We derive the physical bounds on CPAL sensors (ACS Photonics <strong>7</strong>, 2080, 2022; J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. <strong>55</strong>, 085301, 2021), showing that their sensitivity and resolvability may go well beyond traditional electromagnetic sensors, such as Fabry-Perot interferometers. Later on, in 2021, we experimentally demonstrated this concept by means of PT-symmetric lumped-element circuit and transmission-line networks (Phys. Rev. Appl. <strong>15</strong>, 014026 (2021)). &nbsp;In 2022, we completed the theory and modeling for the generalized higher-order PT-symmetric electronic circuits, and analyze their lower bounds of critical inductive coupling required to achieve the DEP (IEEE Trans.
