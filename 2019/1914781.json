 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic is warming on average twice as rapidly as the rest of the planet, resulting in substantial declines in sea ice coverage and other changes in the Arctic environment with implications for the global climate system.  One major limitation in our understanding of these changes is a relative lack of environmental data in the high Arctic, particularly in winter.  These challenges motivate the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC), the largest multinational scientific expedition ever undertaken in the Arctic.  Operating from the German icebreaker R/V Polarstern as it drifts with sea ice over the period from Fall 2019-Fall 2020, scientists from more than 17 nations will collect a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological measurements of the surface ocean and sea ice, surface trace gas and energy flow, bulk meteorological parameters, vertical profiling, and aerosol and cloud characterization.  This project is one element of MOSAiC and focuses on questions surrounding reactive halogen sources and their impacts on the atmospheric chemistry of ozone, mercury, reactive nitrogen and volatile organic compounds (VOCs); it will provide the most northerly, complete annual record of these gas compounds ever obtained.  This study is being conducted by scientists from the US, UK, Netherlands, France, and Australia in collaboration with the broader MOSAiC collaboration.\r\n\r\nHigh time resolution observations (minutes to 1.5 hours) will be acquired  for atmospheric ozone (by a UV absorption monitor; commercial TEI), gaseous elemental mercury (GEM; commercial Tekran), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), oxygenated VOCs (oVOCs), halogenated VOCs (hVOCs) (all with a custom-made enrichment system and gas chromatography and spectroscopy), oxidized nitrogen species (differentiated into nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)), and the sum of reactive gaseous nitrogen (NOy); custom-built chemiluminescence analyzer).  Data will be thoroughly quality controlled, including by intercomparison with NOAA and the University of East Anglia, UK, calibration scales.  Data will be shared with MOSAiC partners and submitted to the Arctic Data Center for free access and use by the research community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Following months of darkness, solar radiation at polar sunrise initiates a complex web of chemical reactions involving halogen species, ozone, and nitrogen oxides. Two important and interesting phenomena are the nearly complete loss of ozone in the lower atmosphere, so-called ozone depletion events or ODEs, and the oxidation of gas phase elemental mercury (GEM) by halogen species, forming mercury-containing particles that deposit to the snow surface and may thereby enter the food chain. Both these phenomena have been observed in coastal Arctic locations. This project is the first to study them in the remote central Arctic.\n\n\nDuring this project we found ample evidence of ODEs in the atmosphere from the surface up to 1-2 km in spring, driven primarily by reactions with bromine oxide (BrO) and secondarily by iodine oxide (IO), both of which are released from saline snow and ice crystals by photochemical reactions following polar sunrise. The importance of IO in ozone depletion continues over the summer, while BrO is most important in early spring. The role of IO in the polar ozone cycle had not been fully appreciated prior to this study.\n\n\nThe marginal ice zone, which is the edge of the ice pack bordering open ocean, is the most likely source region for GEM in the remote Arctic. Photochemical reactions involving bromine and ozone are responsible for oxidation of GEM and deposition of mercury to the surface. A modeling study concludes that 70% of the particulate mercury deposited to the land-based snow is subsequently re-emitted to the atmosphere as GEM, but only 4% is re-emitted from the surfae of sea ice.
