 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will develop field-deployable, inexpensive sensors to detect deadly and pathogenic viruses, in general, and Zika virus as a specific example to demonstrate feasibility. The proposed sensors will change their color when they detect specific viruses without any need for recurring DNA sequencing and amplification that requires time and are expensive for global deployment. Zika virus is expected to re-emerge this summer in Latin America and affect our cities such as Miami. The system can be adopted to detection of many other viruses such as Ebola, Crimean Congo hemorrhage fever, and Lassa fever. \r\n\r\n\r\nPolymerase chain reaction kits are currently available to detect the ZIKV virus but are time consuming and cannot be deployed in rural areas. The investigator is proposing to developing an aptamer hydrogel with embedded complementary strands that attach to the surface proteins of the ZIKV and absorbs them through its porous cavities causing the hydrogel to undergo (100%) volume and (~30%) color change caused by its embedded 50 nm diameter gold nano-particles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The residual stress built-up due to binding with Zika in excess of 9x10<sup>4</sup> Zika/beam caused nitride beams to buckle. Zika-induced residual stress measured using the triangular patches was 96 MPa. Large-scale cellulose acetate beams were then used to observe the residual stresses caused by 20 nm gold layer (0.24 MPa), aptamers (0.3 MPa), and then with Zika (0.5 MPa).

Atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy were carried out to verify that both the aptamer and Zika become immobilized in the paper.
