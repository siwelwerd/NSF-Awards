 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports research into developing robots that can safely and efficiently work alongside people in crowded spaces, such as warehouses, homes, hospitals, and stores. The goal of the project is to improve quality of life, especially for the elderly, and advance national prosperity. Working in crowded spaces means that the robot comes into direct physical contact with humans and objects, such as doors, shelves, and wheelchairs. Safety is therefore of paramount importance, and the robot needs to give way to humans while also helping them. The robot's interactions with people and objects are often dynamic in nature. For example, a robot may need to physically support a stumbling person while guiding them by the hand, or it may need to use the weight of its own body to open a heavy door. Dynamic interactions like these are beyond the current capabilities of robots. The project uses a new type of robot that balances on a single ball while being able to safely interact with people. The award performs fundamental research into dynamic interactions, by humans and robots, for accomplishing challenging tasks in an efficient, robust, and safe manner. The project provides a deeper understanding of how humans interact with their surroundings, which can also be used in the future for improving ergonomic designs and prosthetic arms. The research team is also developing new algorithms, designs, and controllers for collaborative and assistive robots, which have the potential for widespread societal benefits. \r\n\r\nRobots capable of safe dynamic interactions, with continuous adaptation and fast reactions, represents a paradigm shift from current  approaches. The research provides an end-to-end study of full-body dynamic interaction tasks. The research contributes a series of human subject studies that will provide knowledge of human dynamic interactions. It also develops new dynamic interaction models and novel methods for planning, machine learning, and real-time control of dynamic interactions. To make this research possible, the research team will be utilizing a unique dynamically stable and agile mobile manipulator: the Carnegie Mellon University ballbot. The person-size ballbot locomotes on a single ball wheel, providing omnidirectional motion with intrinsic compliance, and is equipped with two human-scale 7-degree-of-freedom arms with hands.  Research contributions to dynamic interaction, planning, learning, and control are demonstrated on this robot platform and rigorously evaluated through a diverse set of integrative tasks, including cooperative carrying, maneuvering a manual wheelchair, cooperative task teaching, sit-to-stand maneuvers, and dynamic navigation in cluttered spaces.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Similar to the BB-8 from science fiction, the Ballbot balances on a single ball-like wheel the size of a soccer ball. However, the Ballbot&rsquo;s body has an extended torso and two arms that give it overall dimensions similar to those of an adult human. The robot is designed to interact and collaborate with humans, and to work in human environments. By balancing on a ball, the Ballbot is not only capable of performing smooth motions with a small footprint, but it can easily shift around its weight and lean into objects.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">To make the Ballbot more agile, we developed the ability of pushing off walls to quickly change direction. We ran a study that observed how humans push off walls to gain a deeper understanding of how people perform the task. We then developed controllers and algorithms for mapping these behaviors onto the Ballbot and other robots. We also explored having robots learn push-off behaviors on their own, which is useful for robots that are not as human-like as the Ballbot.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">To manipulate objects, the robot needs to control its arms as well as its torso and base. As the robot is constantly balancing on its ball, it needs to lean its torso to compensate for arm movements and the weight of objects in its hands.&nbsp; We therefore developed controllers for the arms and the base that coordinate with each other. These controllers use models of the robot and object dynamics to make smooth movements, while also being reactive to sudden disturbances. For example, we had the Ballbot hold a glass of juice on a tablet, while a human pushed the robot aside.&nbsp; The controllers allowed the human to easily push the robot with their hand while the robot did not spill a drop of juice.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">One key challenge of dynamically interacting with objects is making and breaking contacts. For example, when picking up an object while moving, the object will suddenly apply forces to the hand when contact is made, and the weight of the object needs to be compensated when lifting the object. We developed algorithms for modeling these sudden switches in the dynamics based on data collected by the robot. These switching models were used to generate controllers that allowed the robot to smoothly&nbsp; and reliably switch between contacts without stopping.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">To dynamically interact with a wide variety of objects, the robot must be able to estimate the material and mass properties of objects&nbsp; and adjust its behaviors accordingly. These properties can often only be determined by physically manipulating the objects, such as, picking up a box to determine its weight. We therefore created algorithms for estimating the object properties from interactions. These algorithms consider how the effects of the interactions would vary depending on object properties and then select the most likely properties based on the observed effects. Our developed algorithms allow the robot to estimate mass properties quickly while performing a task. Thus, when the Ballbot needs to push aside a large box of clutter, the robot can quickly estimate the mass of the box and adapt its pushing behavior accordingly. This ability to adapt to different dynamics also allows the Ballbot to push people in a wheelchair and adapt as they shift their weight around during transit.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">As the robot builds models of objects in its environment, it is important to reason about the limits of these models. If a robot has never interacted with the leaves of a houseplant, then it should not assume that they will be rigid. Making plans with such incorrect assumptions can lead to critical failures, such as trying to lean on a house plant. We developed algorithms that allow a robot to capture these model limitations. Once the robot knows these limitations it can try to stay within these constraints, or carefully collect more data to expand its capabilities, and thus increase the robot's reliability.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Overall, the project has explored how robots can utilize their own dynamics as well as those of objects in the environment.
