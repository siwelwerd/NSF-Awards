To this end, AISES will develop and host the Convening on Computer Science Research Infrastructure for Native-Serving Institutions, gathering faculty from a diverse set of Native-serving institutions to understand the issues they face, securing funding, and engaging students in CS research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
