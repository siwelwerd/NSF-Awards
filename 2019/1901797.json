 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract:\r\nChirality is the inability of an object to coincide with its mirror image, where the left and right hands are perhaps the best-known example.  A topological defect occurs when the system's inherent \"character\", scientifically called its \"order parameter\", cannot be described uniquely at a point, line, or surface.  Both phenomena are pervasive throughout nature, often are coupled, and are fundamental to central questions in science and technology.  A few examples include chirality in quantum optics, semiconductor diodes, and biomaterials - DNA is the best known; chirality transfer, i.e., how chirality can be induced in an otherwise non-chiral materials; and interactions of multiple topological defects.  This project focuses on chirality and topological defects using liquid crystals as a paradigm.  Because of the long length scales and novel optical properties of liquid crystals, many of the associated phenomena can be visualized and measured quantitatively.  This permits a general understanding of chirality and topological defects that would not be possible by studying other materials.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nOwing to their large optical, electrical, and magnetic anisotropies, liquid crystals are an ideal test bed for a multitude of phenomena in condensed matter and beyond. The central theme of this work is to exploit liquid crystals to explore seminal issues of chirality and topological defects that can impact the broader scientific enterprise.  The PI utilizes his nanoscale techniques to create and image controlled chirality and defects at surfaces - sometimes in combination.  Projects include: chirality transfer in biologically-relevant chiral nanocapsules to achieve the Holy Grail, viz., a measure of the chiral induction length; the creation of chiral multipoles; chiral topological defects, induced biaxiality, and skyrmions; multistable \"rewiring\" of line defects; chiral self-assembled monolayers for nanophotonics and semiconductors; and highly complex oily and soapy streak liquid crystalline defects.  The PI's team employs a battery of experimental tools, including optical microscopy, confocal fluorescence microscopy, optical nanotomography, atomic force microscopy, AFM nanolithography, and ellipsometry.  Much of the work is performed in collaboration with chemist Prof. David Avnir and his colleagues at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  By exploiting the PI's ability to create exquisitely tailored nano-scale chiral and topological defect easy axis patterns, and to image liquid crystal orientation down to x,y,z dimensions of 50 x 50 x 2 nm, this work is transforming our conceptions about - and methodology toward - chirality, defects, how the two can be coupled in anisotropic fluids, and broader issues in condensed matter.  In particular, the PI's work is leading to the understanding, quantification, and exploitation of induced chirality in otherwise achiral materials, as well as a deeper knowledge of chiral and achiral topological defects, their manipulation, and potential applications in optics and electronics.  The issues studied cut across multiple disciplines, as consequences of chirality and defects appear throughout biology, chemistry, physics, medicine, pharmacology, and materials science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The central theme of this work has been the exploitation of LCs to explore seminal issues of chirality and TDs that can impact science and technology.\n\n\nOur work covered a number of topics. We demonstrated how arrays of nano- and microscopic TDs can be scribed on a polymer surface, which then serves as an alignment layer for a LC deposited on that surface. Then, by applying an electric field in the plane of the surface, we showed how defect (disclination) lines that connect these defects can be manipulated and rearranged to create a variety of patterns that are multistable. We also showed how the structure of the defects can be modified in the presence of an electric field: 1) Individual defects can decompose into multiple defects of weaker strength; 2) The orientation of the LC molecules can readjust so that the defect converts into an \"escaped\" 3D orientation pattern that is not a defect at all, as the orientation is well-defined at all points in space; and 3) the field can induce a crossover from 3D to 2D behavior of the TDs. In zero electric field and in the absence of a confining top substrate for a patterned TD, we discovered that the topography of the top surface can form a hill or divot, depending on the particulars of the pattern and the physical parameters (such as elastic constants) of the LC. In a related vein, we discovered that a thin layer of smectic LC can form a surface topography when deposited on a small square patterned with straight lines. Here the surface patterning forces the smectic to adopt a complicated structure (called an oily streak) to match surface boundary conditions. But the structure of the resulting film has a Goldilocks thickness, and thus a hill or divot may form over the square by material transport to achieve this special thickness. We also discovered fascinating dynamical behaviors. Here our main observation is that, depending on the dielectric properties of the LC, an applied electric field can induce a pair of TDs to co-revolve around a common central point. (Think here of a binary star system). We showed, in fact, that this behavior is actually secondary, as the electric field is actually inducing an electrohydrodynamic instability in the LC, which couples to the molecular orientation field of the TDs and causes them to co-revolve. We showed how the use of a chiral LC can reduce the magnetic field required to switch the orientation of the LC molecules, a technique that is relevant to LC displays. In our recent work with Profs.
