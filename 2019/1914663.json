 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current structural systems are made of homogenous materials such as cast iron, wrought iron, bare steel, and brittle plastic, which are highly susceptible to failure and therefore require accelerated inspection and repair. Ultrasonics is a nondestructive evaluation method based on propagating elastic waves in structures, which are affected by defects in the structure and can therefore be used for damage diagnostics. However, in conventional structures, the amplitude of elastic waves decays with distance due to spreading/scattering, which limits the detectability of critical defects. In this research, new structural systems will be designed with an embedded or externally added lens so that ultrasonic signals can be focused and amplified as they propagate in the structure. In this way, ultrasonic wave energy can be transmitted and preserved over long distances. The research will allow detecting defects at their earliest stage and preventing unexpected failures. The target application will be pipeline systems due to their high susceptibility to failure. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society. This multi-disciplinary research encompasses metamaterials, sensors, additive manufacturing, structural monitoring, and design. The project features a synergistic educational component that integrates the strengths of two institutions in recruiting students who are underrepresented in engineering. In particular, female undergraduate and graduate students at both institutions will be connected via mutual workshops and the Society of Women Engineers (SWE).\r\n\r\nThis research will introduce a conformal gradient-index (GRIN) metamaterial lens as part of a structural system such that elastic waves will be amplified as they propagate through the non-planar structure. With the GRIN lens, different ultrasonic wave modes (i.e., longitudinal, flexural, or torsional) will be focused and transmitted such that higher frequencies (50?200 kHz) will be able to propagate with the increased sensitivity to structural damage. The GRIN lens will be designed by varying the refractive index of unit cells, and the existing model of the GRIN lens for flat surfaces will be modified for conformal surfaces. The metamaterial lens layer will be created with 3D printing, which will allow more practical and light weight structures to be easily integrated into the host structure. Additionally, a novel composite pipe structure, produced with multi-material additive manufacturing technologies, will be designed with the embedded metamaterial lens to address the highest risk of major incidents from the conventional materials used in pipelines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, when waves propagate along the circumferential and axial directions of the pipe, multiple wave modes occur due to the limited boundary of pipe thickness. These wave modes are categorized based on the displacement profile across the pipe thickness, with the most used modes being longitudinal and torsional. The selection of wave modes in guided wave ultrasonics depends on the specific types of defects being targeted. In pipe inspection using guided wave ultrasonics, two main challenges arise: attenuation, which refers to the decay in wave amplitude as it travels, and dispersion, which occurs when wave refraction within the pipe thickness leads to wave modulation. These factors need to be carefully considered and managed during the inspection process.</p>\n<p>In this research, a modification is made to the pipe geometry using a gradient-index phononic crystal (GRIN-PC) to manipulate ultrasonic waves and concentrate their energy into a focal region, thereby addressing the issue of attenuation. The GRIN-PC consists of scatterers arranged periodically, allowing for the manipulation of ultrasonic waves by modifying the effective refractive properties (i.e., phase velocity in solid) of the base structure. While GRIN-PC has previously been applied to planar structures such as plates, this research represents an early application to conformal structures, specifically pipes. Through computational and experimental simulations, it was observed that the amplitudes of longitudinal waves were doubled at the focal points, deviating from the conventional attenuation behavior. For longitudinal wave modes, the entire pipe geometry requires the presence of the GRIN-PC. However, the research also demonstrated that for the torsional wave mode, a focal point can be achieved using just ten repetitive unit cells of the GRIN-PC. Torsional wave modes exhibit greater versatility compared to longitudinal wave modes, as they are sensitive to various types of defects. However, they lack sensitivity to thickness changes caused by uniform corrosion. By integrating the GRIN-PC lens into the pipe structure, the dispersion characteristics are modified to enhance the detectability of thickness changes specifically for the fundamental torsional wave mode. The research also demonstrates the reciprocal behavior of the GRIN-PC lens, which allows for focusing planar waves into a localized region and transforming localized sources into planar waves. This property enables the advancement of another nondestructive inspection method known as acoustic emission, which relies on the release of energy from active defects. With the presence of the GRIN-PC lens, the amplitude of the acoustic emission signal from local defects, such as cracks and leaks, is doubled. As a result, the axial distance between sensors can be increased proportionally. Additionally, the frequency response characteristics of the pipe with the GRIN-PC lens exhibit a highly narrowband response. This characteristic helps reduce errors in source location and minimizes the second challenge associated with wave dispersion in pipes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pipelines failures can have significant consequences, resulting in harmful environmental and economic impacts. These failures are typically caused by factors such as corrosion, manufacturing defects, and external interferences, which can lead to leaks or bursts. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to promptly address pipeline issues through thorough inspections and timely repairs. The GRIN-PC lens is a mechanical lens without requiring any electronics. Hence, the GRIN-PC lens integrated with pipe provides an easy solution to increase the detectability of different defect types in long-range pipelines. The theory and application of phononic crystals have been incorporated into a graduate course on nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods to raise awareness about this new class of materials and advance NDE techniques. The research findings have been disseminated through conference presentations and peer-reviewed journal manuscripts. Furthermore, this research has provided support to numerous female and underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students, enabling them to enter the workforce with exceptional positions. The collaboration established as a result of this research has expanded to include the design of 3D GRIN-PCs, aiming to advance the inspection of complex materials and geometries, particularly in additive manufacturing processes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/06/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Didem&nbsp;Ozevin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1914663/1914663_10612020_1691323103881_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1914663/1914663_10612020_1691323103881_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Experimental pipe\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1914663/1914663_10612020_1691323103881_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Experimental pipe\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Steel pipe with GRIN-PC lens with the amplified signal amplitude at the focal point.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Didem Ozevin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Didem&nbsp;Ozevin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Experimental pipe</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1914663/1914663_10612020_1691323184669_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1914663/1914663_10612020_1691323184669_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Torsional wave focusing\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1914663/1914663_10612020_1691323184669_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Torsional wave focusing\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Pipe with and without GRIN-PC lens to control the torsional wave.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Didem Ozevin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Didem&nbsp;Ozevin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Torsional wave focusing</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1914663/1914663_10612020_1691323372266_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1914663/1914663_10612020_1691323372266_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Stub Distribution\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1914663/1914663_10612020_1691323372266_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Stub Distribution\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Stub heights distributed around pipe circumference to control wave velocity.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Didem Ozevin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Didem&nbsp;Ozevin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Stub Distribution</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1914663/1914663_10612020_1691323472186_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1914663/1914663_10612020_1691323472186_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pipes with varying thickness\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1914663/1914663_10612020_1691323472186_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pipes with varying thickness\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Pipes with three different thicknesses and GRIN-PC lens to demonstrate the detection of thickness loss due to uniform corrosion.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Didem Ozevin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Didem&nbsp;Ozevin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Pipes with varying thickness</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
