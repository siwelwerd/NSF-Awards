 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources (IUSE: EHR), this project aims to serve the national interest by improving undergraduate students' STEM knowledge and competencies.  To accomplish this goal, the project will redesign a series of archaeology and anthropology courses, laboratories, and field research opportunities.  The redesigned introductory course and laboratory for majors and non-majors will fulfill the STEM requirement for all degree programs at the University.  The project will also expand opportunities for Archaeology/Anthropology majors, other STEM majors, and non-STEM majors to participate in undergraduate research. The project team expects that these changes will improve student interest, persistence, and competencies in STEM, thus supporting development of a well-prepared STEM workforce and STEM-literate population.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of the project is to improve STEM competency among STEM and non-STEM undergraduate students.  The project will redesign Archaeology and Anthropology courses  so incorporate research-based instructional practices.  Expected project outcomes include student knowledge and competencies in STEM, as well as increased interest and persistence in STEM fields.  The project will address three primary research questions:  (1) Can participation in archaeology field research improve STEM competencies of undergraduate students, including students who are first-generation college students and/or from low-income or rural backgrounds?  (2) Does a scaffolded approach to archaeological research, including the redesign and alignment of courses to support undergraduate research, maximize STEM learning outcomes? (3) What impact does archaeological research have on undergraduate academic success for all students?  The mixed method comparison study will examine the effectiveness of project activities and test the hypothesis that student participation in undergraduate research can maximize STEM learning outcomes.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
