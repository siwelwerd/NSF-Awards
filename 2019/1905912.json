To promote the progress of science, the focus of this project is to study polymer nanocomposite coatings that have the potential to improve the ability of solar cell devices to utilize a broader section of the solar spectrum allowing for more efficient energy production. The fundamental issue that the project seeks to address is how to combine dissimilar materials in such a way that the properties can be varied by controlling how well the particles are distributed  In addition to experiments,  computer simulations will be used to guide the selection of polymer and particles and to help interpret experimental results.  Block copolymers, which are two different polymer molecules tied to each other, will be manipulated to create horizontal and vertical alternating domains (like a stack of cards) that contain nanoparticles of complementary functionality. To determine the location of particles and size of aggregates, state-of-the-art characterization tools will be used.  This research will produce phase diagrams that allow for the determination of environmental conditions that promote good mixing between the polymer and particles.  Besides producing a well-educated, scientifically skilled workforce, the integration of research and education benefits society at several levels. For example, graduate and undergraduate students will participate in annual public events including Nanotechnology Day at Penn,  Philly Materials Day, and the Philadelphia Science Festival.  An additional exciting outreach program is Girls in Engineering Mathematics and Science Camp (GEMS), a weeklong day-camp that introduces middle-school girls from the Delaware Valley to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. \r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to understand the fundamental principles that control the spatial distribution and assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) in block copolymers (BCPs) and to understand the thermodynamics and phase separation pathways of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). The overarching goal is to perform systematic studies that build on expertise in polymer and NP diffusion as well as NP assembly in PNCs. \r\n(1) The first aim is to tune the nanoscale separation between plasmonic NPs and upconverting nanoplates/nanospheres in horizontally and vertically aligned lamellar BCPs. By functionalizing the NP with polymer brushes, the two NP species will be located in alternating BCP domains. The effect of domain spacing and particle loading will be investigated. PNC field-theoretic simulations (PNC-FT) will be used to determine the free energies of these PNCs and predict the cylinder-to-lamellar phase transition. \r\n(2) The second aim is to study the thermodynamic behavior of binary (A/NP) and ternary (A/B/NP) PNCs. The phase diagrams will be mapped out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on isothermal samples as well as the new in situ X-ray scattering capabilities. As in the first aim, PNC-FT will provide guidance for selecting materials parameters and help interpret results. \r\n(3) The third aim is to investigate phase separation dynamics of binary (A/NP) PNCs to elucidate the fundamental parameters that determine aggregate size and percolating morphologies in kinetically trapped systems. PNC-FT modified to include dynamics will guide experiments and provide insight into the balance between thermodynamics and dynamics that dictate the final morphology. Particle diffusion will be measured using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry.  Polymer brush relaxation and ion diffusion through percolated morphologies will also be measured. In summary, although fundamental in nature, the proposed work has the potential to create PNCs with enhanced upconversion luminescence and fast ion mobility, which is of importance for solar energy and energy storage devices, respectively.  \r\n.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project aims to explore the basic principles that determine how nanoparticles are distributed and assembled within these materials, as well as to investigate how temperature and composition changes can affect their structure.

First, binary and ternary nanocomposites were explored to understand the factors influencing how the materials behave and how nanoparticles group together. Adding a third component improved the mixing of nanoparticles by helping them to arrange themselves at the boundary between the areas rich in polymers and those rich in nanoparticles. You can see the results in <strong>Figure 1</strong> (Macromolecules 2021, <strong>54</strong>, 797-811). A straightforward model was created to make sense of how this mixing works in ternary blends. Theoretical work and simulations were conducted to investigate a broader range of conditions than what could be tested in a lab. To reduce experimental costs, machine learning is being used to predict optimum parameters for achieving uniformity in ternary blends.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Second, unique morphologies were fabricated by balancing the degree of surface enrichment, phase separation, and wetting within polymer nanocomposite films (<em>ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces</em> 2023, <strong>15</strong>, 10974&minus;10985). Depending on temperature and time, films undergo different stages of phase evolution, resulting in homogenously dispersed nanoparticles at low temperatures, enriched nanoparticle layers at the PNC interfaces at intermediate temperatures, and three-dimensional bicontinuous structures of nanoparticle pillars at high temperatures. Compared to conventional polymer blends, these structures exhibit increased elastic modulus, hardness, and thermal stability. <strong>Figure 2</strong> shows how the hardness and modulus increase for films exhibiting a bicontinuous structure.&nbsp; This study demonstrates a pathway to control the size and spatial correlations of surface and internal microstructures, which in turn control film wettability, toughness, and wear resistance.</p>\r\n<p>The third study investigates the interplay between film thickness and surface and internal morphologies in polymer nanocomposite films<em> (Macromolecules</em> 2024, <strong>57</strong>, 6634&minus;6645). This system contains 25 wt % nanoparticles in a polymer matrix annealed in the phase-separating region. For thinnest films, nanoparticle surface density remains constant, and lateral phase separation is inhibited. For thicker films, surface density increases with time before approaching random close packing. Moreover, lateral domain growth exhibits a dimensional crossover as thickness increases, consistent with domain coalescence. Water contact angles decrease upon annealing in agreement with the PNC composition evolution. For the thickest films, the morphology map in <strong>Figure 3</strong> summarizes the distinct internal arrangements of nanoparticles: disordered aggregates, continuous vertical pillars, discrete vertical pillars, isolated domains, and random networks.

In particular, particle dispersion can be achieved through either thermodynamic control or by rapidly quenching the composite to stop the morphology from evolving. This latter approach is widely adopted in industrial processes where temperature and time constraints are crucial, and product throughput is significant. Therefore, one broader impact of this research is to offer industry new insights into processing, leading to improvements in polymer nanocomposite properties.</p>\r\n<p>Additional broader impacts involve annual training of a diverse group of 12 to 15 students including undergraduates, PhD, Masters, and post-doctoral students.&nbsp; This grant also supported student field trips for graduate training and education to Brookhaven National Laboratory for their annual workshop and Washington DC to participate in Science Outside the Laboratory Energy Workshop (<strong>Figure 5</strong>).&nbsp; The PI also co-organized &ldquo;Where Research Begins,&rdquo; a workshop to prepare undergraduates for their first research experience in the STEM field.&nbsp; Students and the PI also co-organized a coding boot camp with the University of Puerto Rico-Humacao (co-support from NSF/PREM).&nbsp; Students interacted with the public by creating demonstrations for annual science events, including Philly Materials Day and NanoDay@Penn.&nbsp; Annually, students present research at national and local meetings (<strong>Figure 4</strong>).&nbsp; To further disseminate research, PI presents invited talks and publishes journal articles.&nbsp; The PI directed a community engagement project with an interdisciplinary undergraduate team to determine if coatings on asphalt can lower surface temperature and mitigate urban heat islands.
