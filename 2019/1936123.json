 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the Pacifichem 2020 Congress, \"The Chemistry and Physics of Atmospheric Aerosols,?\"to be held in December 2020.  The conference is sponsored jointly by the American Chemical Society, the Canadian Society for Chemistry, the Chemical Society of Japan, the New Zealand Institute of Chemistry, the Royal Australian Chemical Institute, the Korean Chemical Society, and the Chinese Chemical Society. The Chemical Society of Japan is the host society for the 2020 Congress. The Congress will emphasize the multidisciplinary science of atmospheric aerosols and provide opportunities to network among Pan-Pacific research groups.\r\n\r\nThe meeting will include the following sessions: (1) Chemical composition of atmospheric aerosols, fog and cloud water; (2) Multi-phase reactions of aerosols and environmental surfaces; (3) Physical properties of atmospheric particles; (4) Impact of aerosols on cloud formation; (5) Frontiers in modeling studies of aerosols; and (6 and 7 - two evening sessions) Frontiers in aerosol analytical chemistry and spectroscopy.  This project will support the travel of graduate student researchers, postdoctoral fellows, assistant professors, and junior researchers who will present their research at the symposium.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
