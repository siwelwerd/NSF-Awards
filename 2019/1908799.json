The workshop will focus on forming a community of  researchers from underrepresented communities interested in commutative algebra. The workshop is primarily aimed at graduate students in their first through third years of a Ph.D. program.  The goals of the workshop are to (a) introduce participants to cutting edge research topics in commutative algebra, (b) facilitate the formation of mentoring relationships between participants and faculty in commutative algebra, (c) strengthen the network of underrepresented researchers in commutative algebra and surrounding fields, and (d) develop collaborative relationships that cut across standard topic-collaborations and involve diverse groups of researchers. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will include presentations from prominent researchers, active group work, opportunities for participants to present their own research, and community building activities.  The workshop will have four 50-minute plenary lectures given by tenured or tenure-track faculty, four 20-minute talks given by senior grad students, and two poster sessions encouraged for all non-speaker participants. Furthermore, in order to help participants better understand the techniques and methods presented in the plenary talks, there will be discussion sessions and problem sessions for active work.  The plenary talks are centered around commutative algebra, but the intended speakers have interests intersecting representation theory, algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and computational algebra.  The conference website can be found at https://juliettebruce.github.io/gwcawmmg/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
