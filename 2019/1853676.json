This project targets the professional development of early career scholars that are currently completing a graduate degree, or are in the early stages of their academic, professional career. The ICC provides a scientific venue that covers all aspects of cartographic research, a venue that is ideal for young scholars to present their research and to talk face-to-face with an international community of scientists. Young scholars who have attended previous ICCs have demonstrated productive research programs in cartography and GIScience, as evidenced by their scientific publications and success securing funding to support their research. \r\n\r\nThe long-term impact of this support for students and early career scholars is research innovation and collaboration that promotes future leaders in research in cartography and GIScience in the United States. Participation in the International Cartographic Conference will lead to the development of globally relevant cutting-edge research and will enable U.S. scholars to take a lead in these endeavors. These young scholars develop new research agendas that couple key scientific and societal challenges in collaboration with the international community, and actively disseminate technical and methodological advances in cartography through workshops, seminars, and peer-reviewed publications. These young scholars benefit from exposure to ideas from the international cartographic community, but also share the American experience in this high priority research area for cartography and GIScience. These accomplishments in turn result in the development of a creative and productive workforce conducing innovative research in cartography and geographic information science that serve the Nation's interests regarding spatial information infrastructure. Although the conference is being held in Tokyo, Japan, the event will provide new insights and approaches to cartographic research throughout the world, including the United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe International Cartographic Conference (ICC) is the biennial conference of the International Cartographic Association (ICA). The NSF grant supported 21 US early career scholars (up to $2,000 each) for a total of $40,766 to present a paper and/or poster at the 29th ICC and 18th ICA General Assembly in Tokyo, Japan, from July 15-20, 2019. The NSF grant also supported eight early career scholars (approximately $2,450 each for in-person attendees and $150 for remote student registration during the COVID pandemic) for a total of $8,434 to present a paper and/or poster at the 30th ICC in Florence, Italy, from December 14-18, 2021.  All NSF funds have thus been spent.\n\n \n\nEarly career scholars are students at U.S. institutions and those who completed their degree within the last five years.  In addition to publishing in the conference proceedings or abstract compilation and presenting a paper, early career scholars met and exchanged ideas with foreign colleagues from many countries, and they reported a wide range of benefits to their careers.  Their scholarly achievements in terms of publications of peer-reviewed articles, writing of grant proposals, and improvement in teaching influenced by their ICC participation have been impressive.  All early career scholars made important international collaborations and some included conference material into their research and teaching.  ICC participation provided new ideas for some early career scholars\u2019 thesis and dissertation research and facilitated the progress towards tenure and promotion for others.  Participation in the ICC has had an important influence on the careers of more mature scholars as they develop into leaders in the U.S. cartographic research community, and it has provided opportunities for international leadership.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe evidence of return from this NSF grant and its impact on research and scholarly development is compelling in scientific innovation and on long-term development of worldwide leaders in cartography.  The impressive records of the early career and more mature scholars that resulted from ICC participation provide a clear indication that the impact on the fields of cartography and GIScience is significant, especially considering that about 30 &ndash; 40 U.S. scholars attend the ICC every two years.  Current ICA Commissions address cutting-edge research, and participation in the ICC allows U.S. scholars to be a part of this leading research.  The United States National Committee (USNC) for the ICA works hard to draw in new participation, especially among early career scholars and under-represented groups (women, ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities) and foster their development as the future leaders in scholarly research and the global cartographic community.\n\n \n\nSummary of Outcomes\n\nThe importance of early ICC attendance on cartographic research and leadership among U.S. scholars is significant and compelling.  Of the total of 21 early career scholars supported from this grant to attend the Tokyo ICC in 2019, 18 were attending an ICC for the first time, two had previously attended one other ICC, and one had previously attended two other ICC\u2019s.  The record of these 21 early career scholars in terms of publications, grant proposals, collaborations, and more that resulted (directly or indirectly) from the Tokyo ICC participation is truly impressive.  In total, this record includes 21 papers published in the Tokyo ICC proceedings and abstracts; 67 papers published or forthcoming in peer-reviewed journals; and two published books or book chapters.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick Kennelly"
