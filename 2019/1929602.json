 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intense lake-effect snowstorms frequently occur during cold-air outbreaks over large bodies of water such as the Great Lakes of North America.  Salty bodies of water, such as the Sea of Japan, can generate similar storms.  For example, \"sea-effect\" snowstorms produce prolific snowfalls in Japan near the Sea of Japan coast.  Such storms, however, pose a major challenge for forecasting because they are often highly localized, leading to dramatic contrasts in snowfall from one community to the next.  The research seeks to advance the knowledge and prediction of lake- and sea-effect snowstorms by determining how the presence of hills and mountains affects the intensity and distribution of snowfall downstream of large bodies of water such as the Great lakes and Sea of Japan.  The project involves the mentoring of two graduate students, a research experience for an undergraduate student from an underrepresented group each summer, and international collaboration with meteorologists in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe research focuses on two critical questions concerning the interaction of lake- and sea-effect snowstorms with complex terrain: (1) how does the interplay between lake- or sea-effect processes and orographic forcing influence storm dynamics and the inland and orographic enhancement of precipitation, and (2) how does the presence (or absence) of orography modulate inland penetration?  In addition, the research examines the capabilities and limitations of forecasts produced by convection-permitting models and ensembles, which is a critical step for improving lake- and sea-effect forecasts. To explore a diversity of lake- and sea-effect processes and topographic interactions, the research team will examine and compare lake- and sea-effect systems generated by Lake Ontario and the Sea of Japan. In addition to using observations collected during the 2013/14 Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field program in North America and well-sited radar and dense precipitation networks in Japan, the research will involve the use of real-data simulations by the Weather Research and Forecasting model and idealized simulations by the Bryan Cloud Model version 1 (CM1).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLake- and sea-effect snowstorms produced during cold-air outbreaks over relatively warm bodies of water can produce intense, highly localized snowstorms that disrupt transportation and commerce.  Lake-effect snowstorms downstream of the Great Lakes of the United States and Canada produce some of the most intense snowstorms in the world and enable regional winter-sports economies in downstream communities.  Similar storms occur downstream of other water bodies, including the Sea of Japan, which contributes to seasonal snowfalls ofmore than 500 inches of snow in some mountainous regions and some of the deepest seasonal snowpacks in the world.  Lake-effect storms can be organized by flow interactions with upstream topographic features and can be especially intense over downstream hills, mountains, and plateaus.  Understanding these upstream flow interactions and downstream enhancement processes is critical for weather prediction and anticipating trends in snowfall due to climate change. \n\nIn this project we used observational and computer modeling techniques to examine how lake-effect storms are affected by the presence of topographic features both upstream and downstream of bodies of water.  For example, we illustrated how flow interaction with the topography of the Korean Peninsula contributes to an especially intense sea-effect precipitation feature known as the Japan Sea Polar Airmass Convergence Zone (JPCZ).  We also investigated how the processes driving lake-effect storms change at coastlines and as they penetrate inland over downstream topography.  Using computer modeling we showed that these processes vary depending on the type of lake-effect storm, which has implications for operational weather forecasting.  Finally, we identified the factors contributing to heavy lake-effect snows in rural communities in the western Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York.  \n\nThe project involved the mentoring, training, and professional development of six graduate students.  Four of these students have graduated and are working in the meteorological or environmental positions in the military, government, or private sectors.  Two others are pursuing advanced degrees at the University of Utah. \n\n Project results have also been integrated into learning modules for a new general education science course at the University of Utah, Atmos 1000: Secrets of the Greatest Snow on Earth.  This unique course in the atmospheric and snow sciences focuses on snow and mountain weather and explores contemporary issues related to winter sports and water resources in Utah and around the world. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/18/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: W.
