 "awd_abstract_narration": "The neutron is a basic building block of ordinary matter and most of the Earth's mass comes from neutrons. However, when freed from a stable atomic nucleus the neutron decays into a proton, electron, and antineutrino with a mean lifetime of about fifteen minutes. Neutron decay played an important role in the early universe: it determined the relative abundances of light elements (hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium) and their isotopes that were formed in the first minutes after the Big Bang. Due to its simplicity, neutron decay is an ideal system for studying details of the most basic forces of subatomic physics, in particular the weak nuclear force. Such studies improve our understanding of nature and may provide hints of new fundamental physical phenomena yet to be discovered. The neutron mean lifetime has been measured with an uncertainty of less than one second by individual experiments, but results from the two main experimental methods, the beam method and the ultracold neutron storage method, currently disagree by more than eight seconds. Resolving this discrepancy is a matter of great importance.   This award supports the preliminary design of a next-generation beam neutron lifetime experiment called BL3. It will employ new, powerful technical features to enable its goals of resolving the discrepancy and providing a reliable measurement of the neutron lifetime to well below one second of uncertainty.  This project provides an excellent opportunity to train undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs in the methods and theory of neutron science which are applicable to diverse scientific studies in physics, chemistry, materials science, and biology at existing and emerging neutron sources around the world.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this project is a preliminary design of the BL3 apparatus, a new experiment to measure the neutron lifetime using the beam method. It is similar in concept and improves upon previous beam neutron lifetime experiments. It will employ a significantly larger superconducting magnet to accommodate a large area neutron beam and will incorporate many technical improvements, such as much higher counting statistics, a more uniform magnetic field in the trapping region; a large, segmented, ultrathin window silicon proton detector; and a sophisticated neutron time of flight spectrometer. BL3 has two scientific goals: 1) to investigate and test systematic effects in the beam method that may contribute to the 8.4 s (4 sigma) discrepancy between the beam and ultracold neutron storge experiments;  and 2) reduce the total uncertainty of the neutron lifetime beam method to less than 0.3 s. The value of the neutron lifetime has important consequences in nuclear physics, particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe neutron lifetime is an important parameter for understanding helium production in the big bang and for testing the self-consistency of the standard electroweak model.  For such a fundamental value, it is not very well known, especially if you take into account the discrepancy between two different measurement methods.  So far, bottle measurements are more precise, but they consistently don?t agree with beam measurements.  The difference could be due to systematic errors in one of the methods, or it could be caused by physics that we do not understand like dark matter. The outcome of this grant was to take a step toward understanding this discrepancy between beam measurements and bottle measurements of the neutron lifetime. \n\n \n\nUnder this grant, we designed the next generation experiment to measure the neutron lifetime using the beam method.  This experiment will be capable of measuring the neutron lifetime to better than 0.1%.  With this uncertainty from a beam measurement, the discrepancy will either disappear or become clear enough to herald new physics.  The experiment will be built over the next four years, then will take its data on a neutron beam, probably at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\n\n \n\nHamilton College designed a system to measure the velocity spectrum of the neutron beam.  The lifetime measurements are slightly sensitive to the speed of the neutrons going through the apparatus and the neutron velocity spectrum led to large (~0.5%) corrections in past beam experiments.  For the new experiment, we will measure the distribution directly so that we can calculate this correction accurately.  The velocity spectrum will be measured by placing a neutron chopper in the neutron beam upstream of the lifetime experiment.  The chopper will block the neutron beam most of the time, but will occasionally let brief bursts of neutrons through.  These bursts of neutrons will be detected twenty feet away on the downstream side of the experiment.  The arrival time of each neutron will be measured and its speed inferred from the time-of-flight between the neutron burst leaving the chopper and arriving at the detector. \n\n \n\nUnder this project, seven undergraduate students were introduced to the triumphs and frustrations of research while working on the technical details of a chopper system.  Among other things, they built a prototype chopper capable of stopping neutrons based on inexpensive optical choppers.  They also tested the timing regularity of the device and calculated the impact on the neutron lifetime experiment.  The seven students included two from underrepresented groups in physics and one woman.  Of the seven, one went to graduate school in physics and four went to graduate school in engineering.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gordon L Jones"
