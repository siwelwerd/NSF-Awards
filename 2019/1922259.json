 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer methods that can predict materials organization and behavior, combined with property measurements, have the potential to accelerate the search for new materials for emerging applications. This project will identify new materials built from both large polymer molecules and small-dimension liquid crystals that combine two kinds of conductivity within the same molecule. These materials can form regions that act like \"wires\" to transport charged atoms (ions) through one type of liquid-like wire, and electrons through another type of solid wire. These types of molecules allow the design of conducting channels of different sizes and shapes. Such materials combine a variety of features needed for future robotics as well as those for energy storage and production. This materials discovery research will be carried out by an interdisciplinary team skilled in computational science and engineering, polymer chemistry, polymer engineering and physical property studies. Workforce training in this DMREF program will provide a stimulating and constructive environment in which participants are exposed to a comprehensive materials design cycle. The focus of the project also provides a compelling and unique context to convey the importance of science and engineering to students, facilitated by partnerships with established programs for the general public and students in high school and university. DMREF students will collectively participate in research and teaching to underrepresented groups. The data, materials design and machine learning software developed under this project will contribute to the Materials Genome Initiative national infrastructure and be accessible by the broader scientific and industrial community. \r\n\r\nMixed ionic/electronic conductors have been shown using traditional cumbersome research approaches to have promise for energy storage materials and to possess unexpected synergy between conducting phases. This DMREF program will accelerate the discovery of new promising mixed ionic/electronic conductors by using a dual iterative cycle to study the general phase behavior and transport dynamics of self-assembling polymeric and oligomeric liquid crystal mixed conductors.  A machine learning approach will combine a genetic algorithm to propose successive generations of candidate materials, and a neural network scheme to construct a regression model to correlate input (a library of chemical groups and structures) with output variables (conductivity properties). An important aspect of the intellectual merit of this project lies in the development of processes to integrate computation, experiment and data analysis for the design of these functional materials. The proposed research is envisioned to not only shed light on the role of structure on phase behavior and charge transport, and their effect on interface sharpness and conductivity between the solid-like electronically conducting phase and the liquid-like ionically conducting regions but also lead to new applications as energy storage, sensing and robotic materials. Collaborations will provide additional expertise to this program.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by funds from the DMREF initiative and the Polymers Program in the Division of Materials Research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Chicago, an improved understanding has been attained of the correlation between molecular design and performance of mixed ionic/electronic conductor (MIECs) materials. Engineering such materials, wherein both electronic and ionic conduction can occur within the same molecule, is an emerging area of research expected to become increasingly important for applications relying on the connection between electrolytes and biological systems (where signaling and operation relies on ionic conduction) and electronic devices (where signaling happens through electronic conduction), to perform sensing, actuation, communication, or computation as needed in robotic materials, energy-storage and production devices, etc.</p>\n<p>The team used an integrated and iterative loop of chemical synthesis, characteri&shy;zation, and computational modeling to carry out the design, assembly, and performance assessment of both small and large-molecule MIECs. Collaborations were facilitated by monthly team video conferences and in-person meetings at scientific conferences. Since 2019, this work has led to 17 manuscripts either published (13) or in preparation (4) for publication in leading scientific journals. Developed software relevant to both self-assembly and conductivity calculations is available through an open source web site (<a href=\"https://github.com/escobedo-lab\">https://github.com/escobedo-lab</a>) and additional information about the group activities were accessible in a Cornell website while the project was active (this is now being re-deployed into a web site depository).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Among the scientific knowledge gaps and questions that were addressed thought the complementary computational-experimental studies include: &nbsp;(i) The improvement of electronic transport by enhancing the solid-like character of the electron-conducting domain via the stiffening of the conjugated segments (see Fig. 1), (ii) the improvement of ionic conductivity by enhancing the liquid-like character of the ion-conducting domains through the use chemistries that place ion-binding groups far from the interface with the solid domains, while promoting more disorder near that interface (see Fig. 1), (iii) elucidating (through analysis of X-ray diffraction patterns and molecular simulation data) the details of the structure and packing of the different functional groups and how these affect mixed conduction properties, (iv) showing how novel designs of small-molecule branched MIECs can assemble into more intricated ordered morphologies with 3D percolating domains (see Fig. 2). Finally, the team addressed a key disadvantage of small-molecular MIECs: while they can readily self-assembled into ordered, percolating structures, ideal for the target mixed conduction, they are also insufficiently robust to allow their widespread application. The team thus developed new chemistries that allow the small molecules to crosslink after assembly so as to preserve their mixed conducting properties while becoming more stable to mechanical deformations (this is illustrated in Fig. 3).</p>\n<p>Besides peer-reviewed publications, research results from the team&rsquo;s efforts have been highlighted and disseminated through invited seminars and either in-person or on-line video conference presentations involving audiences in the U.

The project provided educational training and professional development opportunities to a highly integrated team of graduate and post-doctoral researchers who, while mastering specific disciplines, are cognizant of the synergism of multiscale com&shy;putational modeling, chemical synthesis, and advanced physical characterization methods to address challenging questions on materials design.
