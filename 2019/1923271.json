 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a topical conference on electron probe microanalysis in June 2019 at the University of Minnesota. NSF will contribute to the costs associated with bringing 30 early career scholars to this workshop, which includes undergraduate through post-doctoral and professionals within two years of their terminal degree.\r\n\r\nQuantitative analysis by electron probe microanalysis is fundamental to earth and materials sciences. Analytical skills obtained by students are invaluable and form a foundation for quantitative techniques that are related to x-ray spectrometry. Characterization of lunar and meteoritic materials is routinely performed by a community that would benefit from closer ties to the microanalysis community. Micro-Analysis Society (MAS) Topical Conferences provide this educational support at a very reasonable price for attendees. Several students have found employment in the microanalysis community due to their educational experience in meetings organized by MAS. Current advances in microanalysis of light elements and cathodoluminescence provide renewed support for technological advances in Li battery and LED technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
