 "awd_abstract_narration": "DNA nanotechnology enables the design of dynamic nano-scale devices that can exhibit complex motion, reconfiguration, and transfer forces similar to macroscopic machines. These tiny constructs are also easily modified to incorporate biomolecules or nanoparticles, making them highly promising as tools to perform mechanical testing at a molecular scale or to create shape transforming materials. However, realizing the functional potential of such DNA-based devices or materials requires a robust approach for the rapid and precise control of their motion. To address these challenges, dynamic DNA-based devices and materials will be integrated with magnetic actuation platforms to enable robust and cost-effective approaches to test mechanical properties of biomolecules and DNA-based nanomaterials whose shape and properties can be magnetically controlled in real-time. These devices and materials can have broad applications in fields including biophysics, nanomanufacturing, biosensing, and nanorobotics. In addition, the research project will provide inter-disciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students in fields including magnetism, biophysics, DNA nanotechnology, and nanomaterials. The work will be translated into broader science and engineering workforce training through outreach activities for high- and middle-school students and teachers in topics of physics, engineering and biology (e.g. magnetism, mechanics, DNA) with hands-on classroom and laboratory projects that demonstrate DNA self-assembly and magnetic actuation of DNA devices.\r\n\r\nDNA-based self-assembly is a powerful method to create nano-constructs of molecular systems. To achieve the full potential of these systems rapid temporal (sub-second) and high spatial (10-50 nm) control has remained a challenge. This work will integrate design and hierarchical assembly of DNA devices and materials with a domain-wall based magnetic tweezers platform to enable advanced controlled actuation of DNA constructs. These magnetic tweezers allow for simultaneous control of multiple magnetic particles with force and motion inputs in multiple directions and at multiple locations. The study will thus leverage magnetically driven DNA constructs to develop force spectroscopy platforms with a focus on testing effects of applied forces on molecular interactions, in particular protein-DNA interactions. The devices will enable application of forces in multiple directions (e.g. tension and compression), which is highly challenging with other methods, while the DNA structures provide precise control over relative positioning and orientation of molecular samples. Furthermore, materials will be developed based on hierarchical assembly of DNA nanostructures where domain-wall magnetic tweezers will drive expansion, collapse, or rotation of materials and/or underlying components. Geometrical parameters and actuation forces will be guided by finite element simulations to render novel tailored DNA structural metamaterials with tunable properties such as negative Poisson's ratio or drastic shape changes that can be controlled via user-defined or computer controlled magnetic fields. Outreach and education efforts will engage students and high school teachers through the Ohio State University Translating Engineering to K through 8 program. Portable magnetic actuation systems will be developed to allow these high school teachers and students to interact with nanoscale systems and demonstrate associated basic concepts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
