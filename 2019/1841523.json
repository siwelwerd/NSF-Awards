 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States is annually impacted by windstorms, causing large numbers of fatalities and injuries and severe damage to residential, commercial, and industrial buildings as well as to power, communication, transportation, water and other lifeline systems. Insured property losses exceeded $300 billion over the last twenty years while total losses are estimated to be twice that number. The goal of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Wind Hazard and Infrastructure Performance (WHIP) is to enhance the resiliency of buildings and infrastructure against hurricanes, tornadoes, and other windstorms. Findings generated from WHIP Center research and implemented by its industry partners will contribute to community resiliency against wind hazards while enhancing the economic competitiveness of the U.S. and the well-being of its citizens. Students will interact with industry partners, understand their needs, and obtain both academic and professional training. The WHIP Center will be promoted and grow in size and impact by attracting additional industry members and collaborating institutions. It is envisioned as a national center that will address multiple thrusts in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). The concept of disaster resiliency will be advanced among industries, government agencies, and the public at large through publications, and social media.\r\n\r\nThe WHIP Center will adopt a broad-based approach aimed at serving its members, who are concentrated in the insurance, risk modeling, and construction industries. Its major research themes are: a) wind hazards assessments; b) estimation of exposure and vulnerability of buildings and infrastructures; and c) improvement of community resilience. Within these themes the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) will select the projects based on their priorities and the Center?s faculty specialties and expertise. Texas Tech University (TTU), as one of founding sites of the WHIP Center, has had an ongoing wind related research program for forty-eight years and supports a broad array of facilities including Ka-band mobile radars, 200m met tower, low-rise test building, wind tunnel, tornado simulator, and debris impact facility. The projects will leverage these facilities along with analytical models to build a strong linkage to fundamental research and technological innovation. Dual-Doppler radar and in-situ anemometry can measure and validate microscale surface winds in landfalling hurricanes. Fragility curves generated from tornado simulator could be quickly transitioned into design standards and building codes. Aerodynamic database of wind tunnel data would help formulating probability distributions of pressure on building components for differentiating wind-water damage in hurricanes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
