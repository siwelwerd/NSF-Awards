 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomers rely primarily on observations of electromagnetic radiation -- light -- to study objects ranging from stars to galaxies to quasars. Dust grains in interstellar space absorb and scatter this light. The same dust grains also radiate at long (infrared) wavelengths, and this infrared radiation is observable. Dust grains affect the appearance of astronomical objects from X-ray to sub-millimeter wavelengths.\r\n\r\nTo understand what we see, we must know how the scattering and absorption properties of dust grains depend on their composition, size, and shape. In addition, absorption and scattering of light can produce strong forces and torques on grains. For example, light from our Sun can repel dust grains approaching the solar system. Sunlight can also cause grains with irregular shapes to spin fast enough for centrifugal stresses to disrupt the grain.\r\n\r\nBecause dust grains have irregular shapes, calculating scattering and absorption is a challenging mathematical problem.  The investigator aims to improve methods for computing scattering and absorption for grains with complicated shapes. One emphasis will be on the important case where the grain itself is small compared to the wavelength of the radiation (as in the infrared). A second emphasis will be on developing and implementing much faster methods for computing the forces and torques acting on the grain.\r\n\r\nThese improved methods will be implemented in new versions of the publicly-available open-source code DDSCAT which the investigator developed and supports.  The new version of DDSCAT will be used to compute a \"library\" of scattering and absorption cross sections. This will be done for a sample of grain shapes and compositions, and for a wide range of wavelengths. The library will be available on-line to other researchers. The library will include cross sections needed to calculate scattering and absorption, as well as data needed to calculate forces and torques acting on grains.\r\n\r\nThe cross-section library will be used to develop and test models for the interstellar dust population. One popular model envisions typical interstellar grains as loose aggregates. The library will be used to see whether this model is compatible with existing observational data.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n Optics of Interstellar Dust: New Methods and Applications\n\nThe objective of this research effort was to advance our understanding of the properties of \"dust grains\" in interstellar space, ranging from molecules containing as few as 25 carbon atoms, ranging up to micron-sized particles containing perhaps 10 billion atoms. Dust grains contain most of the \"refractory elements\" (such as iron and silicon), as well as about 50% of the carbon, in the interstellar medium. These dust grains are recognized to be very important for the dynamics of the interstellar medium, and the formation of stars and planets. \n\nBecause we don't have collections of these particles in the laboratory, we can only study them by observing the way they absorb, scatter, or emit light that can be measured using astronomical telescopes. To interpret the observations -- made with telescopes both on the ground and in space -- we need to understand theoretically how these solid particles can absorb, scatter, or emit photons of light.\n\nWhen we observe light from stars, it is often measurably polarized, because the interstellar dust that it has to travel through on the way to the Earth attenuates one polarization mode more than the other (just like polarizing sunglasses). This polarization provides important clues to the shape of the particles, and part of the present research effort has been directed to finding out what can be deduced from \"starlight polarization\".\n\nWe find that interstellar dust grains must be appreciably nonspherical: if they are \"cigar-shaped\", the axial ratio must be at least 2 in order to produce the observed amount of starlight polarization, even if the dust grains are \"perfectly\" aligned by the interstellar magnetic field where they are located (the grains are believed to be spinning with their shortest axis tending to be aligned with the direction of the local magnetic field).\n\nThe same dust grains that account for the polarization of starlight \"glow\" at long wavelengths, and (because the grains are not spherical, and are aligned) this thermal \"glow\" is polarized. Happily, we are now able to measure the polarization of this thermal glow; we examine what grain shapes are allowed by the splendid polarization observations made by the Planck satellite.\n\nA major outcome of this research effort has been the development of a new model for interstellar dust -- the so-called \"Astrodust+PAH\" model. This theoretical model appears to be consistent with all of the currently-known observational constraints provided by a broad array of observations. We expect this model to provide a basis for future studies of interstellar dust.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/18/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: BruceTDraine\n"
