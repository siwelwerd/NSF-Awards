 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL ABSTRACT\r\nThe purpose of this NSF CAREER Award is to enrich scientific understanding of basic principles governing stem cell biology by using novel approaches to investigate the emerging role of atomically thin materials such as graphene in controlling stem cell fate. To accomplish this, the principle investigator will integrate functionally patterned graphene and graphene derivatives into bioscaffolds to control and measure the fundamental biophysical cues that encode information for human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) growth and differentiation. Electrical connections to the graphene bioscaffolds will serve to modulate temperature and electrical fields while also actively monitoring the electrochemical exchange at the cell-graphene interface during growth and differentiation. In order to elucidate graphene's structure-property-processing correlations on hMSC differentiation, genetic profiles will be compared for hMSC growth on epitaxial graphene on SiC substrates, polycrystalline graphene films grown by chemical vapor deposition on copper foils, and graphene films printed from chemically exfoliated graphene nanoflakes. Electrical bias applied to the graphene films will be used to monitor the effect of transmembrane voltage on hMSC fate, as well as the impact of electrical signals on extracellular matrix production and the mechanical properties of engineered musculoskeletal tissue. Intellectual Merit: The fundamental knowledge gained will enable a complete set of design rules for electrically active bioscaffolds that can couple or decouple biophysical cues responsible for stem cell growth and differentiation. The data produced through these experiments will be made publicly available to further advance in silico research of biomolecular processes and subsequent integration in virtual physiological human models. Broader Impacts: By integrating graphene into the tissue engineering cycle, potentially transformational outcomes will likely include new instrumentation for stem cell culture, new multifunctional bioscaffold materials, and new research avenues for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Integrated educational outreach activities leverage a local dual-language immersion public charter school and undergraduate service-learning programs to raise awareness about STEM opportunities for English language learners. \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT\r\nStem cells offer the remarkable ability to develop into many different cell types and tissues. Thus, they not only have the potential to cure damaged or diseased organs, but also provide a platform to study the fundamental chemistry of life. Researchers have long studied stem cell biology in vitro with a focus on the impact of biochemical reactions and mechanical cues on stem cell fate. These scientists culture stem cells on various types of materials which serve as bioscaffolds, engineering the materials to leverage the mechanical crosstalk between the stem cell and the scaffold to control their fate. There are few investigations that leverage electrical and thermal cues which vary in space and time to control stem cell fate. The recent discovery of graphene (a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a 2-dimensional hexagonal crystal structure) has opened up new possibilities for bioscaffolds to control such electrical and thermal interactions with stem cells. Therefore, the goal of this NSF CAREER award is to integrate graphene with stem cell biology to uncover the fundamental interactions of these two systems. Intellectual Merit The proposed work will have an impact on stem cell biology and atomically thin materials research by providing new fundamental insights into the role of electrical and thermal cues in controlling stem cell fate. Broader Impacts: Achieving control over stem cell fate could revolutionize tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, reducing dependence on organ donors to treat patient end-stage organ failure. Scientific outreach activities will help establish a pipeline of English language learners from a local dual-language immersion program into Boise State University's STEM programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
