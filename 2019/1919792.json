 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded by the Major Research Instrumentation and Chemical Instrumentation Programs.  Professor Charles Simmons from the University of Hawaii at Hilo and colleague Matthew Platz have acquired a single crystal X-ray diffractometer (XRD).  A diffractometer is a powerful tool used to determine the detailed structures of compounds which can be crystallized. It produces an X-ray diffraction pattern which is analyzed to obtain the microscopic structure, that is, the distances and angles between atoms in the material.  This structural data provides insight on the properties and possible uses of a substance under investigation, for example natural products of local interest. Hawaii is home to many unique and largely unexplored natural products, and there is much interest in these substances as pharmaceuticals. The diffractometer is housed at the U.S. Pacific Basin X-ray Diffraction Laboratory at Hawaii at Hilo.  It is serving researchers at this institution and others in the region including the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Brigham Young University-Hawaii and the University of Guam. The instrument is used to train undergraduate and graduate students in research and in an undergraduate laboratory course preparing them for the modern workforce.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of an XRD instrument is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. XRD is being employed in projects to synthesize cobalt-dioxygen complexes.  The photochemistry products from irradiation of diazo compounds are being characterized. The  structures and absolute configurations of natural products derived from endophytic fungi and plants are determined along with other natural products of possible therapeutic value.  Metal-organic framework systems (MOFs) are also synthesized and crystallized for study and characterization - these materials have many applications in producing clean energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It has been used to solve the structures of over 30 new molecules. A drawing of a representative para-toluenesulfonylhydrazone molecule is attached. Most of the structures solved with the new diffractometer were synthesized by UH Hilo undergraduates in the NSF-funded laboratory of the co-PI. These structures will be published in the peer reviewed scientific literature in manuscripts currently in preparation. The para-toluenesulfonylhydrazone molecules are synthetic intermediates that are used to prepare unstable diazo compounds. The diazo compounds are exposed to monochromatic radiation and the products so formed are studied by an NSF funded gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. A number of natural product and synthetic samples were submitted to the X-ray facility by UH Hilo faculty members in the Daniel K. Inouye College of Pharmacy, and their structures determined. We expect more samples to be submitted from around the Pacific basin in the coming academic year as the global pandemic recedes. The structure of sucrose obtained with the NSF-MRI diffractometer will be used to teach chemical structure in the chemistry 242L instructional laboratory. A UH Hilo undergraduate student (shown in the photo) has been trained by the PI in chemical crystallography.
