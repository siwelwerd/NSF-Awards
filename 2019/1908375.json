 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sampling and estimating structural information from \r\nlarge-scale networks or graphs has been central to our \r\nunderstanding of the network dynamics and its rich set \r\nof applications. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has \r\nbeen the key enabler for a broader context of graph \r\nsampling, including estimating the properties of large \r\ngraphs, sampling the corpus of documents indexed by \r\nsearch engines, sampling records from hidden databases \r\nbehind Web forms, identifying subgraphs of certain \r\ncharacteristics and frequent graph pattern matching. \r\nDespite versatile applications of the MCMC methods and \r\ntheir customized algorithms for analyzing \r\ngraph-structured data in various forms, there still \r\nexist critical challenges and limitations in the \r\nliterature centered around the MCMC methods. One is the \r\n'cost' consumption/constraints associated with the \r\nsampling operation, which limits the size of total \r\nsamples obtained and negatively affects the accuracy of \r\nany estimator based on the obtained samples. Another \r\nlimitation is that the recent advances in MCMC, \r\nespecially built up on favorable non-reversible Markov \r\nchains, cannot be leveraged to the various large-graph \r\nsampling tasks, due to their required global knowledge \r\nof the underlying state space, lack of distribution \r\nimplementation, unconstrained state space, as well as \r\nthe simplified cost assumption. The goal of this research is to fully exploit the \r\npotentials of a set of crawling samplers by making the samplers adaptive and possibly \r\ninteractive on a properly constructed graph domain, to \r\ntranscend the current status-quo in the wide range of \r\ngraph sampling tasks. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project aims to: (i) build a theoretical framework to \r\nconstruct a suite of cost-efficient sampling policies \r\nby optimally balancing the tradeoff between the sample \r\nquality and quantity under challenged access \r\nenvironments with a given cost budget, (ii) design a \r\nclass of adaptive random walks by fully exploiting the \r\npast information to achieve minimal temporal \r\ncorrelations over the obtained samples and by \r\ncontrolling the random walks collectively to enable \r\nmaximal space exploration, and (iii) extend the \r\nstandard MCMC toolkits toward faster and more \r\ncost-efficient exploration of feasible \r\nsubgraphs/configurations and computing/optimization on \r\na graph, along with extensive validations to create \r\npractical and usable solutions in reality. This \r\nresearch has a high potential impact on a vast range of \r\nmulti-disciplinary applications, including sampling \r\nlarge-scale graphs for statistical inference and \r\nefficient estimation and randomized algorithms for \r\ncombinatorial optimizations in various disciplines, \r\nwhere the standard MCMC methods have been dominant but \r\nalso constrained our understanding.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
