 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Alabama State University will re-design the introductory biology laboratory learning experience by integrating an evidenced-based research and learning (EBRL) experiences into the existing first-year courses. This activity will have a significant impact on student retention, persistence and graduation in the department and serve as a model for other STEM departments at ASU and other HBCUs.  \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on transforming the first-year introductory biology laboratory course curriculum and enhancing the quality of STEM education at ASU, leading to the formation of a new research-intensive teaching curriculum in biology laboratories. The evidenced-based research and learning (EBRL) experiences will be integrated to augment the use of innovative information technology and learning by improving cyber-infrastructure and instruction technology for biology laboratory learning. The overall goals of this project will be achieved by 1) providing cutting edge evidenced-based teaching and research to improve the introductory biology curriculum in gatekeeper courses; 2) providing effective mentoring, advisement, and state of the art research experiences for freshmen and sophomore level students from underserved populations; and 3) upgrade teaching and research infrastructure in the introductory biology laboratories. The implementation and periodic external and internal evaluation of these objectives will attract and sustain underrepresented minority students to the biological sciences and improve their overall undergraduate learning experiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
