 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes (QLCI) program is part of the Quantum Leap, one of the research Big Ideas promoted by the National Science Foundation. This award is a QLCI Conceptualization Grant, which supports activities to build capacity among teams planning for the large-scale, interdisciplinary Challenge Institute projects that aim to advance the frontiers of quantum information science and engineering. Research at these Institutes will span the focus areas of quantum computation, quantum communication, quantum simulation, and/or quantum sensing. The Institutes are expected to foster multidisciplinary approaches to specific scientific, technological, and workforce development goals in these fields.\r\n \r\nThis Conceptualization Grant will develop well-formulated plans for a future Challenge Institute proposal along the theme of quantum transduction.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
