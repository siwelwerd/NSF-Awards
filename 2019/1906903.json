 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support student and postdoctoral attendance at the Annual ACM/SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms Science (SODA) 2019, in San Diego, CA on January 6  to 9, 2019.  SODA is co-sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).  SODA is the premier annual research conference in the field of discrete algorithms and one of the three premier conferences in theoretical computer science. SODA has been meeting annually since 1990 and in a typical year has approximately 4000 attendees.  It is co-located with three smaller workshops, ALENEX (Meeting on Algorithm Engineering and Experimentation), ANALCO (Meeting on Analysis of Algorithms), and SOSA (Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms).  SODA is attended by researchers all over the world.  The field of algorithms is a vibrant one, with high participation rates from young researchers, and many papers with student authors. For these student authors and student attendees, the conference serves as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides.\r\n\r\nThe award will provide partial support to approximately thirty students, partly defraying the cost of travel and lodging.  Efforts will be made to support students from under represented groups\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
