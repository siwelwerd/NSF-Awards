 "awd_abstract_narration": "When a massive star reaches the end of its life, the core of the star collapses, producing a supernova. While visually spectacular, less than 1% of the energy in the supernova is released as visible light or as kinetic energy in the surrounding environment. Most of the energy from the supernova is carried away by neutrinos produced during the collapse of the core.  In contrast to photons, neutrinos interact only very weakly with matter.  They can therefore stream out of the supernova explosion without delay and thus arrive at Earth minutes to hours before the optical explosion may be visible. Detecting the first neutrinos from a supernova therefore provides an early alert to trigger further observations. The SuperNova Early Warning System (SNEWS) is a network of neutrino detectors around the world designed to provide automated early alerts for supernovae in our galaxy. While rare, a galactic supernova would provide a unique opportunity to study the physics of core-collapse supernova, as well as the properties of neutrinos. Alerts from SNEWS will enable observations of the earliest phases of the supernova for physicists and astronomers around the world. The SNEWS project works to engage amateur astronomers by involving them in this science, as they play an important role in optical observations of supernova.\r\n\r\nThis award supports a collaborative group from several institutions to upgrade the existing SNEWS real-time alert system to include new detectors, and to prepare to better exploit the collective capabilities of these detectors.  The team will model neutrino light curves and use those models to evaluate the expected signals in all available neutrino detectors.  They will develop optimal methods for prompt determination of the supernova direction using both neutrino interaction anisotropies, as well as inter-experiment triangulation algorithms which will be based on relative observed timing of the neutrino signals.  Prompt directional information will sharply improve the likelihood to detect the early onset of the light curve in multiple channels.  This is crucial not only for the understanding of supernova explosions, but also for many other areas of physics including astrophysics, nuclear physics, and particle physics.  Finally they will develop pre-supernova alerts based on the observation of the uptick in neutrino production that accompanies the final burning stages of a doomed star.  This proposal also supports involvement of the amateur astronomy community in this exciting area  of research, the creation of a topical planetarium show, as well as a smartphone app for use in education and alert dissemination.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWhen a massive star reaches the end of its life and runs out of fuel, the core collapses, resulting in an explosion visible across the whole universe. As spectacular as that is, 99% of the energy actually comes out in a burst of neutrinos: neutral particles that rarely interact. These neutrinos can thus escape promptly form the star, while the explosion seen in telescopes happens ~hours later when the shock wave finally breaks through the surface of the star.\n\n\nHowever, neutrinos are so hard to see that neutrino observatories on Earth can only detect that burst if it happens nearby: somewhere in our own galaxy. That happens only once or twice per century and would be a treasure trove of both astrophysical and particle physics science. Using the early warning provided by neutrinos and getting the word out quickly will allow observations from the earliest possible time, maximizing the science output of this rare event.\n\n\nThe SuperNova Early Warning System has been running for a couple decades now, allowing neutrino experiments to send things that look like a supernova in a fast, automated fashion. Things that look like a supernova in a neutrino experiment are much more likely to be noise than a supernova: so any individual experiment is reluctant to send a supernova alert without careful checking, using up all that early warning time. However, if more than one experiment sees something at the same time that's most likely a real supernova: the SNEWS system automates this and publishes the \"be ready, supernova coming!\" alarm.\n\n\nThis award supported the development of SNEWS2.0, a rewrite using modern code. This will make it possible to continue the SNEWS coincidence search with existing and new experiments, as it resulted in more robust and maintainable code. It also allows the creation of extensions: for example, publishing sky maps of where the impending supernova might be found, or combining the faint neutrino signals coming from the core of the pre-supernova star into an even earlier warning. Also, the past few years have seen an explosion in science coming from \"Multi Messenger Astronomy\" in general: many other tools, networks, and ways to notify people or trigger other automated observations now exist. Integrating with them is now possible with SNEWS2.0. To accomplish this, SNEWS2.0 uses the \"HOPSKOTCH\" network provided by the NSF-funded SCIMMA project.\n\n\nCoordinating with the observers making use of the early warning to observe the new supernova is key. SNEWS uses emails and GCN bulletins, but the new infrastructure opens up more methods that are already in use by the MMA community, which will facilitate followups. SNEWS2.0 has been working with both citizen scientists and professional transient chasing projects to make sure a future alert is as useful as possible.\n\n\nIn order to better understand what supernova neutrinos look like in neutrino detectors, SNEWS2.0 has published SNEWPY, publicly available code that makes it easy to select from a wide range of published supernova models and see what that signal would look like in all existing and proposed neutrino experiments. This helps the community understand what astrophysical or particle physics effects might be observed, and helps experiments maximize their ability to observe a future galactic supernova.\n\n\nNSF funds have allowed the development of SNEWS2.0, directly supporting the work of students and researchers at a number of institutions in the US and enabling cooperation with other researchers around the world. This has united the community of supernova neutrino researchers from supernova theorists to experimental particle physicists and observational astronomers, both professional and amateurs. We will be ready for the next galactic supernova, and are working to extend and improve upon the work completed so far.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/09/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AlecTHabig\n"
