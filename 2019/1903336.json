 "awd_abstract_narration": "Perturbations in the neutral density in the Earth's middle and upper atmosphere known as gravity waves (GWs) are thought to be an important driver of physical and chemical processes in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) atmospheric region. GWs influence tidal and planetary wave dynamics as well as general circulation and transport processes across many atmospheric layers. The goal of this project is to investigate the interaction of GWs and airglow, faint optical emission emitted by atoms and molecules in MLT during the night. Through this, a better understanding of the impact of GWs on chemical species in the MLT region will be achieved. This project will conduct observations in multiple airglow layers with a chain of airglow imagers near the Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO) in Chile, a well-known GW \"hotspot\". This will be complemented by observations with the collocated lidar and meteor radar, satellites, and results from time-dependent, nonlinear atmospheric models. This project will promote education by supporting a graduate student and an undergraduate student and contribute to broadening participation by supporting the team that includes members from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe work will involve characterization of GW activity near ALO based on the imaging airglow data and comparison of simulation results of GW-airglow interactions with imaging observations. Recent modeling results using a 2D, nonlinear, time-dependent OH Chemistry-Dynamics (OHCD) model and a Multiple-Airglow Chemistry-Dynamics (MACD) models have shown that a transient dissipating GW packet can induce significant variations in the concentrations of the minor species, in the airglow intensity, and in exothermal heating. The variations appear to be aperiodic but are often mistaken for long-period waves. These are secular variations which are a result of a net cycle-averaged transport of chemically-active minor species. The project will simulate secular variations in airglow causes by GWs by using a model of GW propagation together with airglow chemistry models, OHCD and MACD, in conjunction with optical, lidar, and meteor radar observations at ALO complemented by spacecraft data from SABER and SCIAMACHY.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis study investigated the effects of atmospheric gravity waves, originating from the lower atmosphere, on the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (80-110 km altitude).  A focus of the study in this region is the turbo-pause (~100 km altitude), below of which contains a turbulent mixed atmosphere, and molecular diffusion above.  Although there are a number of wave effects on the upper atmosphere, this study focused on the wave effects to three airglow layers in the region.  The objective was to improve the determination of intrinsic attributes of the waves using ground-based airglow imagers.   In addition to imagers, winds and temperatures from other remote sensing methods were used to characterize waves in the study. \n\nCollaboration between scientists at the University of Illinois and Penn State University was a key element of the study.  The collaboration involved sharing knowledge of science and processes among the team, as well as students.  Investigations and analysis also involved the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, the Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO) on Cerro Pachon, Chile, and the University of La Serena, La Serena, Chile.  A specific accomplishment of the team was to include scientists and ionospheric data from the University of La Serena.  This international outreach is important for inclusion and contribution to scientific investigations.  It is a model for the operation of NSF facilities, in this case being the ALO.  The University of Illinois and Penn State interactions were accomplished primarily virtually through the initial two years of the study when Covid prevented in-person meetings. \n\nAccomplishments involved airglow images from three airglows whose layers are formed at slightly different altitudes.  Waves propagating through a given layer provide phase information, which goes through a full cycle (360 degrees), defining the wave\u2019s vertical wavelength.  Among the important aspects are the wave\u2019s vertical wavelength and amplitude with altitude.    Waves whose amplitude grows with altitude at a determined rate are freely propagating, provide no interaction of momentum or energy with the atmosphere.  Waves whose amplitude decreases with altitude, results in both an exchange of momentum and energy.  The results of this study enabled improved characterization of amplitude versus altitude through the airglow observations of propagating waves.  The study also involved extending the climatological imaging data base of the ALO imaging data.\n\nCollaborations also included the redistribution of an older, meteor radar system that was originally at the ALO in Chile, where it was replaced with a new technology radar.  The older unit was shipped to the Arecibo Observatory and installed on Culebra, Puerto Rico, where it is becoming operational and will contribute to spatial/temporal measurements of atmospheric gravity waves.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gary R Swenson"
