 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite progress in protecting people and property in the coastal zone, population pressure and climate change require a concerted effort to protect ecological systems while supporting prosperity, livelihoods, and community well-being.  Hurricanes impact diverse groups of people differentially. Hurricane impacts can exacerbate social and economic inequities and the ability of vulnerable populations to recover. Geophysical, ecological, engineering and social scientific research that informs policy intended to mitigate hurricane impacts has the potential to advance the welfare of all populations. This conference, which is national in scope, will provide a venue for sharing new knowledge from a broad range of disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to hurricanes, their impacts, and modes of measuring resilience and recovery. Promoting resilience of these economically and ecologically important coastal systems in the future will require effective sharing of knowledge across diverse stakeholder groups with implications for effective decision-making and policy development. Conference results will be widely disseminated to researchers, emergency management professionals, government officials, and the public. The conference will also support the inclusion of undergraduate and graduate students in STEM related fields.\r\n\r\nDuring this two-day conference, researchers will have the opportunity to share their findings with a broad audience on a wide range of hurricane related topics such as flooding, water quality and health, hurricane damage and losses, and disaster recovery.  Diverse stakeholder groups, including local, state, and federal government officials, city and emergency managers, and community leaders, will be active participants in the conference communicating their perspective from the operational forefront of hurricane response and recovery. The goal of HuRaCon is to promote high quality science through the discussion of research findings, ways to move forward in developing and implementing solutions based on the findings, and advance impactful future research. The conference has three main objectives: 1) foster effective sharing of knowledge and tools derived from recent hurricane-related research funded by NSF through its RAPID program; 2) demonstrate the different research methods, perspectives, quantitative, and qualitative measurements that contribute to a far richer understanding of hurricanes and their impacts by promoting interdisciplinary collaboration; and 3) emphasize a user-based focus to increase the utility of research findings through effective communication and dissemination strategies across diverse stakeholders and potential users.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "HurriCon: Science at the Intersection of Hurricanes and the Populated Coast  held February 27-28, 2020 was an NSF-funded conference held in East Carolina University?s new student center in Greenville, NC.  The conference was designed to bring together disciplinary and interdisciplinary researchers from a broad range of subject matter areas and community stakeholders affected by hurricanes.  The conference attracted more than 200 registered attendees.  The conference addressed the following critical challenges:\n1) How will coastal landforms and coastal ecosystems respond to rapidly changing conditions (both natural and human induced) especially given the expectation for continued relative sea level rise acceleration?\n2) How will human settlement and economic activity along the coast respond to evolving coastal landforms and ecosystems under rapidly changing conditions?\n3) How can improved understanding of both near-and long-term evolution of the coupled natural-human coastal system be applied to inform stakeholder decisions made at the local, state, and regional scales?\n \nThe major goals of the conference were \n1) Foster effective sharing of knowledge derived from recent hurricane-related research.\n2) Facilitate and encourage cross-disciplinary collaborative research teams to promote better understanding of the coupled natural-human coastal system.\n5) Facilitate effective communication between stakeholders and scientists by emphasizing a user focus to research findings.\nThe conference was in person and occurred February 2020 just prior to COVID 19 related  travel restrictions and university regulations that shut down many operations.  The conference fostered interaction between researchers and stakeholders.  The conference program included a bus tour of areas of eastern North Carolina that had experienced severe impacts due to recent hurricanes and associated flooding.  Princeville, NC (credited as the first town founded by former slaves) and Windsor, NC that experienced significant flooding due to Hurricane Mathew were two stops on the narrated bus tour.  A workshop was conducted in conjunction with the conference on risk communication that focused on the yet-to-be-acknowledged COVID-19 Pandemic.  \nThe scope of hurricane topics covered is demonstrated by the academic outlets of the research work.  More than forty archival journals have published work by the presenters on the topics presented at HurriCon.  The journals range from disciplinary topic areas of Chemistry, Ecology and Engineering to Policy, Health, and Society in addition to multidisciplinary hazards journals.\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jamie B Kruse"
