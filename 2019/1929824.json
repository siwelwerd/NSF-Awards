 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Sustainable Urban Systems (SUS) workshop is to identify key sustainability issues associated with megapolitan growth and promising research areas that could be harnessed to promote a more equitable and healthy urban future. By convening a diversity of expertise across an array of disciplines, sectors, and locations, this conference aims to: (1) identify the key challenges megapolitan regions and their adjacent communities and natural spaces face as urbanization continues, (2) explore the myriad approaches used in megapolitan regions to address these challenges, and (3) synthesize this information to identify priority research areas that a research network could promote for improving urban systems sustainability. \r\n\r\nIn pursuing the megapolitan-focused approach, input will be solicited from a diversity of experts through an interdisciplinary, synthesis-focused agenda. The target to converge and focus on the most critical megapolitan challenges and opportunities and outline a framework for building strong, collaborative relationships. It is anticipated that the active engagement and participation of academics and industry with local governments and non-profit groups who are tasked with implementing sustainability initiatives will lead to a number of new partnerships and outputs. The end products from this conference, shared widely across the PI and co-PIs networks, will take form as a (1) white paper to NSF, (2) peer-reviewed synthesis article journal article, (3) \"Green Print\" for work managers and practitioners to help them transition material from the conference into their daily work, and (4) scope of work for informing future education and outreach products.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF-funded Sustainable Urban Systems workshop focused on the concept of ?urban greening? in megapolitan areas as a lens to understand change within our human and natural systems.  Over 53 participants from academia, government, industry, non-profit organizations, and community groups came together to share insights ideas about how to improve urban sustainability.  In exploring the concept of ?greening,? participants grappled with issues of displacement, environmental injustice, and cumulative impacts, and explored the role of connectivity and resilience in shaping the future of urban and megapolitan systems.  Threaded throughout these conversations were calls for tighter, more conscientious engagement between researchers and community members to pursue science that can meaningfully improve management and livelihoods.\nNext generation urban research should focus on 1) the wealth of emerging data and the responsibility to use these data ethically, 2) the role that communities can play in helping shape urban research by using community members as partners, and 3) using adaptive management for the path towards a sustainable urban future.  Additionally, urban research needs to embrace the dichotomous and tensioned nature of displacement. This means understanding and explicitly investigating the winners and losers of any system change. \n\nKey themes and issues for advancing sustainable urban systems research and implementation challenges and opportunities include:\n\nFacilitating      Data-Driven Science and Policy: New technology and computing capabilities are allowing researchers to      generate and collect data at scales, and in volumes, that are      unprecedented.
