This is an instance of a series of established and successful international triennial conferences on statistical physics that attract a diverse group of approximately 1500 US and international researchers in statistical physics and related fields. Leading researchers and students from around the world will meet at the STATPHYS-27 conference to discuss the latest advances in statistical physics and related\r\nfields, and to identify the most important and promising new directions for future research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
