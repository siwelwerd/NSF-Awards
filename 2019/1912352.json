 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do our brain, nose, and mouth work together to generate the flavor of food and drink?  When flavor perception goes wrong, can this play a role in diseases like obesity?  The sense of smell is very important for perceiving flavor, largely because of odors that originate in the mouth and are exhaled through the nose via the back of the throat in a a process called retronasal olfaction.  In this study, researchers from the University of Arkansas, the Virginia Commonwealth University, and Southeastern Methodist University are teamed up to gain better understanding of how retronasal olfaction works using rats as an animal model.  The researchers combine direct measurements of the brain in action together with computer simulations of air flow through the nose and neural networks. They are testing the idea that different forces in the nose caused by reversing airflow through the nasal cavity are responsible for how the brain distinguishes exhaled retronasal odors from inhaled odors. In addition, the researchers offer training opportunities at each of the three institutions and are developing an educational video game aimed at introducing users to basic concepts of neurobiology and cognitive neuroscience. \r\n\r\nSmells that enter the nose retronasally, i.e., from the back of the nasal cavity, play an essential role in flavor perception, yet many questions about the neuroscience of retronasal olfaction remain unanswered.  How does simply reversing the direction of air flow through the nasal cavity result in different neural input to the olfactory bulb (OB)?  How are retronasal and orthonasal (inhaled) olfactory signals encoded at the level of spiking neurons in the OB?  How do interactions within OB circuits facilitate selective response to retronasal versus orthonasal stimuli?  In this study, researchers from the University of Arkansas, the Virginia Commonwealth University, and Southeastern Methodist University are teamed up to answer these questions, guided by a two-part hypothesis. First, they hypothesize that, at the sensory periphery, retro- and orthonasal stimuli produce distinct spatiotemporal patterns of mechanosensory excitation of olfactory receptor neurons.  Second, they hypothesize that, in the OB, cell-type-specific inhibitory circuit interactions are crucial for dynamic changes in retronasal coding.  To test these hypotheses, the research team is combining high-density multi-electrode recordings in rat OB with fluid dynamics computer simulations based on the three-dimensional shape of the nasal cavity of the same animals. Moreover, the team is performing state-of-the-art realistic computational modeling to identify OB circuit-level principles of retronasal coding.  This work is expected to generate new understanding of the neural basis of retronasal olfaction that includes both peripheral mechanisms in the nose and central mechanisms at the level of M/T cells in the OB. This project is jointly funded by the cross-directorate Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research(EPSCoR), and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe primary goal of this project was to better understand how neurons in the brain encode sensory input, with a focus on the sense of smell. In particular, we aimed to understand how encoding differs for odors that are inhaled through the nose (orthonasal) versus those that enter the nose through the back of the nasal cavity (retronasal). Retronasal olfaction plays a key role in our sense of flavor while eating and may play a role in some eating-related disorders.\n\n\nStudents involved in this research have gone on to successful PhD programs and postdoctoral fellowships. Two postdocs have gained valuable experience both in doing research and mentoring students. The PI and graduate students have given lab tours and conducted outreach events to spread appreciation for brain research among diverse and underrepresented communites.\n\n\nWe discovered several basic facts about olfactory coding and also some new ideas that apply to how the brain encodes sensory and motor signals more generally. For example, we found that, unlike some predictions, when sensory signals arrive at the olfactory bulb from the nose, they cause an increase in neural \"noise\". We also discovered some previously unknown roles for certain kind of neurons (inhibitory neurons) in the difference between orthnasal and retronasal olfactory coding. We made improvements in mathematical methods for modeling neurals systems. More generally, we made fundamental advances in understanding how large populations of neurons can encode sensory and motor signals in certain low-dimensional subspaces. These fundamental results were applied in piriform cortex (where olfactory input is processed), visual cortex, and motor cortex. The biggest surprise from our research was the discovery that motor cortex seems to operate at the tipping point between order and disorder (like a critical phase transition in physics), generating very complex neural signals that are directly reflected in the complex body movements of animals. These discoveries have led to exciting new hypotheses for future studies.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/13/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: WoodrowLShew\n"
