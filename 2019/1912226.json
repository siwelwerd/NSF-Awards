 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the opportunity to enhance inexperienced research writers? written science communication by using a self-paced, web-based research writing software that provides on demand instruction, practice, and feedback throughout the writing process. If successfully commercialized, the technology can transform how both educational and professional spheres approach the research writing process and understand disciplinary writing conventions. Hence, the technology can contribute to an increase in the research competitiveness of individual research programs. In addition, the availability of state-of-the-art writing resources will help promote science by enhancing the public dissemination of research results. Participation in the NSF I-Corps program also offers a great opportunity for graduate students to develop skills in entrepreneurship and innovation, which may lead to a start-up venture that can increase the economic competitiveness of the state.\r\n \r\nThis I-Corps project investigates the commercial potential of the technology, which leads users through a series of interactive, instructional videos that help users become critical readers of how language is used in discipline-specific, research writing in order to become better research writers. Users integrate their new knowledge of language use into practice tools derived from the field of applied linguistics. These tools help users analyze and discover language use patterns that are used to effectively structure a scientific argument. Automated feedback then guides users toward more purposeful analysis of writing. Studies have demonstrated that these tools can heighten user?s awareness of how to construct an original research argument while increasing their self-efficacy in becoming successful published research writers.  Furthermore, the tools have helped users become more independent writers, requiring users to seek less guidance about writing from research mentors who need the extra time to focus on their own research agendas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF I-Corps project brought into the limelight the urgent and universal need to enhance scientific writing across college campuses and research-based industries. Findings indicated that potential users are ready and willing to use automated writing evaluation tools for scientific writing. As a result to customery discovery efforts and entrepreneurial training, the team was able to delve into development of an MVP (minimum viable product), resulting in a prototype of an intelligent turoring system call Dissemity (formerly Wrangler) for disseminating research with clarity. \nIntellectual Merit: Results from 133 interviews with key customer segments and potential partners suggested that a tool like Wrangler would help address several pain points: (1) a lack of time, (2) a need for impactful publications, and (3) a high cost of other services. Time was a reoccurring theme across journal editor interviewees and faculty and student interviewees. Faculty suggested that they spent up to 10 hours per week mentoring students with writing when they would prefer to utilize their time talking about the research design and results. Several engineering professors stated that the time they spend with students could be used to advance their own research agendas. All faculty interviewed would recommend a technology to their students if the university purchased a license agreement and/or evidence showed writing improvement. Students were most concerned about getting high-impact publications that would help them graduate since many of them needed upwards of 2-3 publications prior to graduating. These publications, they stated, would help them obtain a job and establish themselves as researchers in the field. They cautioned, however, that they would only be drawn to a technology if it provided them with immediate feedback on their writing development and if it did not require them to spend too much time learning how to use the technology. Upper administration, such as Vice Presidents of Research (VPR), acknowledged that other resources cost a lot of money. The VPR at a major west coast univerisity, for example, spends $10,000 for a two-day series on grant writing. The need for writing resources sparked the interest of many major publishers, including Elsevier, who shared that authors spend $2,000 on their writing workshops. However, an editor of the journal Ecology Letters hesitates to suggest their services to authors due to the cost; yet, he expressed a definite need for resources that are relevant to publishing in the field, and he would recommend these resources if they are not associated with for-profit publishers. \n\n\nBroader Impacts: The I-Corps program afforded the Wrangler team with integral entrepreneurial guidance. The program was particularly beneficial for the PI, a woman of Hispanic and southeast Asian decent, and the entrepreneurial lead (EL), a male of Hispanic decent. As representatives of underrepresented populations, these individuals received knowledge about the commercialization process that can transfer to the development of a more diverse workforce. Now that the technology has been developed as a functional prototype, it has become a major component of dissertation and thesis writing workshops and the PI's online course for research writing. The team launched the technology campus-wide and expect to launch beyond campus in Fall 2022.\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/24/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephanie M Link"
