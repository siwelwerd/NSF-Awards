 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mission of the NSF Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to support the strengthening of STEM education and research capacity at Native-serving institutions. The project titled \"Developing the Next Generation of STEM Leaders: 2019 TCUP Leaders' Forum and Professional Development for NSF-TCUP Eligible Institutions\" aligns well with this mission. Administered by Sisseton Wahpeton Community College, project personnel organize, design and deliver two types of professional development events for TCU personnel interested in developing their leadership, grant-related skills, and STEM programs. The first event, the Tribal Leaders' Forum (TLF), provides a venue for TCU personnel to participate in formal sessions in which they explore best practices and innovative approaches to STEM research, instruction and evaluation. The second event is a three-day technical assistance workshop offered to TCU personnel that addresses proposal preparation and project management. Follow up technical assistance is offered as well.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the TLF are to strengthen STEM leadership skills in TCUP personnel, to promote STEM education and research at TCUs, to strengthen and expand partnerships between TCUs and mainstream institutions, and to develop strategies for enhancing workforce potential in tribal communities. The goals of the TA workshops are to provide targeted support to TCUs in preparing proposals to secure NSF funding and to develop skills in administering grant projects. A book reporting on the project events will disseminate findings from the work to TCU personnel and other interested stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
