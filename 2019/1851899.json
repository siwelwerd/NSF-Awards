 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will use experimental methods to measure the effectiveness of temporary housing assistance to assisting homeless single adults known as the Rapid Re-Housing Program (RHH) Program to achieve housing stability.  Governments generally provide housing assistance through long-term rental subsidies or vouchers.  Previous research shows that long-term vouchers can prevent future homelessness but also reduce incentives for employment.  A shorter duration subsidy could provide services to a larger group of people given limited budgets, but it may also not be enough to permanently move people out of homelessness.  This research will follow people receiving RRH and a group receiving usual care.  Comparing homelessness, housing, employment, health, criminal justice, and other outcomes between the two groups will provide a  measure of the effectiveness of RRH in improving those outcomes.  The results of this research will provide important inputs for developing policies to provide housing for the homeless and thus improve the well-being of American citizens. \r\n\r\nThis research project will use a randomized control trial method to study the effects of the Rapid Re-Housing (RHH) program on long term housing stability, health and other social outcomes of homeless single adults.  The project will randomly select 360 participants for the program and approximately 360 participants for a control group referred to usual care.  This research project will test the hypothesis that providing RRH to homeless single adults will improve housing stability leading to decreases in homeless shelter entry, housing moves, and hospital visits for program participants.  Housing stability outcomes will be measured using homelessness service usage and changes to address histories in consumer reference data. Criminal justice, health, and other outcomes will be measured using county linked administrative data.  The results of this research will provide important inputs for developing policies to provide housing for the homeless and thus improve the well-being of American citizens.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
