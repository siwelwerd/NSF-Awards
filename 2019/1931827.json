 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a cyber-physical-social system for communities to incentivize emerging ride-sourcing (such as Uber and Lyft) and sharing services to improve societal outcomes. The goal is to enable novel public-private partnerships that leverage these services for a win-win-win outcome for all parties involved: reducing travel times, energy use and emissions, while ensuring cost-effectiveness for public agencies; boosting mobility service providers' profitability; and improving the experience of all travelers. Research results will be disseminated through courses, open-source tools, journal publications, conferences, workshops, and an online short course. This project will provide interdisciplinary training to a diverse group of students, who will be part of the next generation of globally-engaged leaders. Learning sessions and hands-on activities will be designed and offered to general public under the collaboration with the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. \r\n\r\nThis project develops a theoretical, modeling, and computational framework for communities to incentivize emerging mobility services to achieve system-wide goals on efficiency and reliability. This is done through optimally pricing a surcharge or credit to riders' fare with respect to departure times, routes, pooling and curbs (i.e., pick-up/drop-off locations), in conjunction with subsidies to mobility service providers in exchange for guaranteed system improvement. This project advances fundamental knowledge regarding how public right-of-way spaces (such as curbs and roads) and travel demand should be priced and balanced for social optimum. It develops an architecture that integrates travelers' seeking to maximize their utilities and service providers' goals for improving service efficiency and maximizing revenue, with novel optimization and controls of infrastructure and service pricing. In addition, it develops efficient and scalable algorithms to estimate and optimize mixed flows of shared and personal vehicles for large-scale networks. This project will assess multi-source high-resolution data, including vehicle trajectory data from mobility service providers to validate, test and demonstrate this cyber-physical-social system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A surcharge or credit will be issued to TNCs each time a TNC trip uses any of those roads. With those (dis)incentives, TNCs would determine how to route riders along with some compensations that would benefit TNC&rsquo;s fleet as a whole. Riders are provided by TNCs with multiple route options, and incentivized to take a ride that may deviate from the shortest possible route through lower fares or other compensations offered by the TNC. This system is based on the premise that a TNC fleet, once reaching a critical market penetration, oftentimes a small fraction, could have influence on general traffic flow patterns and serve its own best interest in improving fleet efficiency. TNC riders can voluntarily participate in choosing deviated routes with compensation, which is less controversial than other pricing strategies, such as congestion pricing. While the decision ultimately falls upon the rider to take a longer route that will assist in improving traffic congestion, both TNC and public agencies stand to benefit from a service and profit standpoint. Public agencies can save from capital investment of pricing, as fare and sensing systems are already an integrated part of the TNC mobility services.
