 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Data Program for the Social Sciences: General Social Survey (NDPSS) is a social indicators, infrastructure, and data-diffusion program. It has four aims. It gathers data on American society to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviors and attributes at both the aggregate and individual levels. It examines the structure and functioning of society in general and the role of various sub-groups. It provides comparisons between the United States and other nations in order to view American society in comparative perspective and to develop generalizable, cross-national models of human society. It makes high-quality data easily accessible to scholars, students, and others expeditiously and without charge. These aims are accomplished by the regular collection and distribution of the General Social Survey (GSS) and its allied surveys in the International Social Survey Program (ISSP). Since 1972, the GSS and ISSP have been efficiently collected, widely distributed, and extensively analyzed by social scientists and others around the world. Over 30,000 research publications have utilized the GSS/ISSP and they have contributed to every field in the social sciences. For example, they have advanced understanding of cohort effects by examining intergenerational transfers and social mobility and studying intergenerational changes in education and knowledge. They have monitored changes in intergroup relations, gender roles, family structure and values, civil liberties and the impact of globalization on national identity. GSS/ISSP data are used in other science fields, such as environmental science, nanotechnology, polar science, computer/information science, and medical science and health. The GSS/ISSP data are also used extensively by government, non-profit organizations, and the mass media. In education, over 2,000 textbooks and teaching manuals utilize the GSS/ISSP and it is used annually by hundreds of thousands students. \r\n\r\nThe 2020 GSS and associated ISSP rounds (2019-2021) will continue the basic NDPSS mission, balancing replication to measure societal change with both methodological and substantive innovation in both the international and topical modules and follow-up studies. Extensions from past surveys and innovations are planned.  They are: 1) a user \"module\" competition to solicit new survey items that tap emerging social science topics and NSF priorities; 2) an expansion of the multi-level, multi-source (MLMS) data to expand data in the NDPSS through data linkage; 3) using adaptive design during survey fielding to enhance sample representativeness; and 4) working with the American National Election Studies (ANES) team to engage in additional data production surrounding the 2020 Presidential Election.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
