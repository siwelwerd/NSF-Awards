 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in GROW (Graduate Research Opportunities for Women) 2019, held October 4-6, 2019 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This is a conference focused on female undergraduate students who wish to pursue graduate studies in the mathematical sciences. The conference addresses the crucial transition from undergraduate to graduate school, at which the percentage of women drops significantly. It aims to directly increase the proportion and the absolute number of female US students in graduate programs in the mathematical sciences. \r\n\r\nThe conference will feature four hour-long lectures by highly recognized mathematicians on cutting edge research. Collectively, they will cover a broad spectrum of pure and applied mathematics: algebraic combinatorics, epidemiology, homology theory and non-commutative algebra. Informal roundtable discussions at the conclusion of the conference will allow the participants to learn more about research subjects they find interesting, important open problems, current progress and main challenges. Lectures will be accompanied by panel discussions, where the participants will receive information and advice about the application process for graduate school and being a graduate student, and career opportunities in mathematics. More information about the conference can be found at https://math.illinois.edu/grow2019\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
