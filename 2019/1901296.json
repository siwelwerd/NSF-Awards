 "awd_abstract_narration": "South Carolina State University (SCSU) and the University of the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) will enhance their research capabilities in astrophysics by combining their astrophysical resources to form a Time Domain Astrophysical Collaboration (TDAC) which will significantly increase their scientific productivity and move them into the growing field of time domain astrophysics.  The TDAC schools manage or partner in the management of two small aperture telescopes located in the United States Virgin Islands and at Kitt Peak National Observatory. This project will allow both institutions to build research capacity through the addition of personnel, faculty and student support, and improvements to their physical infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe project will add a Resident Observer to the UVI facility and SCSU will hire its first ever Postdoctoral Researcher in astronomy. These enhancements will allow them to participate in coordinated research with the greater astronomical community in multimessenger  observations of the electromagnetic counterparts  of gravitational waves, monitoring  Active Galactic Nuclei  and contributing to Living with a Red Dwarf project on K and M dwarf stars through use their telescope facilities in Arizona (SCSU)and in the Virgin Islands (UVI).  This grant will result in the enhanced research capabilities of the faculty  and recruitment and retention of STEM undergraduate majors at SCSU and UVI through internships, campus research talks, and the incorporation of project results into the curriculum of both institutions, including physics and computer science. It will result in motivating minority students at both institutions to continue on to graduate school or enter the workforce in STEM fields.   \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and HBCU's Excellence in Research (EIR) Program and managed by MPS/AST.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
