 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal REU Site program, hosted by the Extreme Ultraviolet Engineering Research Center (EUV ERC), at Colorado State University is a collaboration between a diverse group of research engineers and scientists from Center member institutions and industry leaders. The goals of this REU Site are to offer research opportunities to a group of diverse undergraduate students in a technically and scientifically challenging field that is becoming critical to industry, with a strategy that will strengthen industry involvement and will continue expanding the program to enable broader participation. The Center conducts research and trains engineers and scientists in the area of lasers and photonics, focusing in particular on the generation and application of EUV light. This laser-generated shorter wavelength light is opening new revolutionary opportunities in science in areas including nanotechnology, materials, chemistry and biology. Moreover, it will have an enormous economic impact by enabling the mass production of the next generations of computer processors and memory. The EUV ERC REU program will provide students with a unique opportunity designed to understand EUV science and technology and to become involved in EUV-related research projects that are technically and scientifically challenging, and highly interdisciplinary. The Center faculty and research labs are producing cutting-edge research and have partnerships with industries that are leaders in the development and commercialization of products that will be at the forefront of the next generation of technology, including critical tools for the fabrication of all future cell phones and computers.\r\n\r\nDuring a 10 week summer program the intent is to increase the student interactions with corporate members of the Center who are world leaders in EUV technologies and applications, and to involve the participation of Center graduates now in industry. REU students who will complete a first summer of research in a EUV ERC lab will have the option to continue their research the following summer in an industry lab, with internships funded by industry. The REU Site will further broaden participation by joining efforts with Prof. Wesley Sims (Morehouse College) and Prof. Willie Rockward (Morgan State Univ.), which are both Historically Black College/University (HBCU) and Prof.  Professor Edwin Fohtung (New Mexico State Univ.), a minority serving institution. A successful REU instills confidence in students to make educated choices about their future careers as engineers and scientists. It enhances their competitiveness for strong graduate programs, and prepares students for career opportunities in coveted industry positions. The program will contribute to educating a workforce is a field of critical national economic importance for global competitiveness in which industry is experiencing a very significant shortage. Very few educational programs exist in the world to train a new generation of engineers and scientists proficient in EUV science and technology. The proposed program will be conducted in close partnership with industry and will contribute to fill this void.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Another exciting possibility requires the use of advanced lasers for the generation of clean, safe, and virtually limitless energy by laser-driven fusion, the process that powers the sun, is attracting large private and public investments.</p>\n<p>The objectives of our REU program are threefold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide undergraduate research experiences that educate students in the field of laser science and engineering, laser/matter interactions, and EUV technology,</li>\n<li>Enable close interactions between students and industry through education and industry-paid internships at industry partner sites, and</li>\n<li>Increase the number of students in the field from underrepresented minority (URM) groups.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since the start of its REU program in 2003, the EUV ERC has supported 314 undergraduates with varied backgrounds, who have worked on projects ranging from EUV lithography to materials characterization, developing skills in modeling, machining, and ____. In Summer 2023, we also hosted 4 students from UC Merced, a minority-serving institution, who grew and tested nanowire targets. These students attended weekly seminars alongside the REU interns and presented their research in an end-of-summer symposium.</p>\n<p>In 2019, the Center was awarded a 3-year REU Site Grant for Engineering Applications of EUV Laser Light, with a one year no-cost extension through August 2023. This REU program coincided with the onset of the COVID pandemic. Nevertheless, we designed our program so that we were able to offer a hybrid experience to the interns during Summer 2020. Students began their program remotely, then, following state and university health guidelines, were later able to come to CSU to complete their experience in-person. One consideration we had for running the program during the pandemic was that many of the students were already expecting the income from their REU experience, and it would have been too late for them to find another job or internship for the summer, especially with so many companies and laboratories still shut down. Starting in the second summer of the grant, the program was run completely in-person, following all safety protocols.</p>\n<p>From 2020-2023, the Center supported 48 REU interns representing 30 different universities. 100% of the students who participated in the REU Program since 2003 and have graduated earned a STEM degree. Of those students who participated in the program in 2020-2023 and have since graduated, 71% are currently pursuing a MS and/or PhD and 29% began work in industry or academic research immediately following receipt of their BS. Additionally, seven students who were REU interns during this grant period have returned to CSU to conduct research or pursue graduate studies, and others have chosen to attend UC Berkeley for graduate school as well.</p>\n<p>The Center&rsquo;s REU program provides an experience for undergraduate students that is aligned in scope with other REU programs, and our students report an increase in understanding and awareness of many of the important issues that REU programs provide to undergraduate students. Students reported feeling a renewed &ldquo;love of research&rdquo;, more confidence, and becoming &ldquo;certain that [they] want to have a career as a scientist&rdquo;. All respondents also said that their experimental skills, presentation and communication skills, time management skills, and fundamental knowledge were improved by the experience, citing several new skills that they had learned from the REU, such as software programs like LabVIEW and MatLab, and troubleshooting broken machines. One of the interns from Summer 2023 even developed doubling crystal units, which allowed us to accelerate to 6 GeV at rep rate- a first in the world.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, our program provides students with the opportunity to have a second-summer experience in industry by conducting a second summer of research with one of our industry affiliates at their facilities. It is important to note that this program is not simply an opportunity for the students to have an internship in industry but is a coordinated continuation of the REU site program. We intended to implement this 2-summer program starting in 2021, but the disruption caused by the pandemic prevented us from implementing it until 2023. Two REU students who completed a summer of research at CSU in 2022, accepted internships at ASML (San Diego) working on aspects of EUV lithography with ASML engineers Dr. Michael Purvis and Dr. Georgiy Vaschenko, who are both EUV ERC PhD graduates. After completing 10 weeks working at ASML one of the REU interns, a non-traditional student, Lory Marchand, returned to the CSU campus for two additional weeks of related research.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/22/2023<br>\nModified by: Jorge&nbsp;J&nbsp;Rocca</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div
