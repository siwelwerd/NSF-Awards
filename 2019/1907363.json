 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. This research specifically looks at the watersheds of Hilo, Hawai'i and the role these have on coral survival in the bay. It is known that corals are affected by land runoff after heavy rains, but very little research has been done to investigate the mechanisms behind coral death. Coral survival depends greatly on the bacteria and molecules found in their surface mucus. The fellow will investigate how coral mucus changes in response to heavy rainfall. This project is important for demonstrating the interdependent relationship between land and ocean ecosystems. This project will broaden participation in biology by targeting Native Hawaiian youth. Native Hawaiians are one of the most underrepresented demographics in biology despite belonging to a culture that is rooted in scientific observation. \r\n\r\nThe fellow will test the hypothesis that stable microbial and molecular communities will be temporarily disrupted during heavy rain events. Mucus collected from the most abundant coral species will be monitored over three heavy rain events. The microbiome and metabolome of coral mucus will be profiled and processed using next generation DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry techniques. Additionally, the fellow will expand research training in microbiome and metabolomic analysis while developing new methods in 3D underwater photogrammetry. The fellow will present the findings of this research throughout the duration of the project at the University of Hawai'i at Hilo's Keaholoa student center. The findings will also be shared throughout the local high schools in Hilo. A final community day at Honoli'i Beach Park will promote the importance of ocean stewardship across watersheds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
