 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop to be held March 30-April 1, 2020 at Cornell University is to identify pathways for the ongoing modernization and revitalization of the geospace facilities and the community that runs and uses them. NSF's Geospace Facilities program currently supports five incoherent scatter radars used to measure the upper atmosphere. These measurements are unmatched by any other technology and are essential to scientific investigations. In several cases, the facilities are over 50 years old and require significant investment to maintain operations. The plan will contain a roadmap for modernizing the facilities and adapting them to meet the evolving priorities and needs of the community. The goals of the workshop are to define a vision for these facilities, to highlight what the community sees as the most important objectives for the Geospace Facilities Program, and to develop a strategy for pursuing them. The workshop will produce requirements for facilities consistent with the objectives, including human-resource requirements, for the next 5-10 years. The results of this workshop will also serve as resources for the Solar and Space Physics Decadal Survey.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
