 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to address several questions at the interface of combinatorics and physics.  More specifically, it will apply algebraic and combinatorial tools to questions involving the exclusion process, Macdonald polynomials, cluster structures in Schubert varieties, mirror symmetry in cluster varieties, and the amplituhedron.\r\n\r\nMore concretely, this project concerns several interrelated questions surrounding the multispecies asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on both a lattice with open boundaries, and on a ring.  This combinatorial model is intimately connected to both Koornwinder polynomials and Macdonald polynomials; and a better understanding of the ASEP should lead to combinatorial formulas for Koornwinder and Macdonald polynomials.  A second direction is to understand the cluster structure on Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian.  This should have applications to toric degenerations and mirror symmetry on the Grassmannian and its Schubert varieties. A final direction concerns the amplituhedron, which was introduced by physicists in the context of scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang Mills theory. Conjecturally, the volume of the amplituhedron computes certain scattering amplitudes, which measure how massless particles interact.  Understanding this conjecture should lead to a new insights concerning the positive Grassmannian.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe aim of the project was to study a variety of questions at the interface of combinatorics and physics.  Some of the main outcomes of the project are summarized below.\n\nThe PI worked with Corteel and Mandelshtam on the combinatorics of a particle from statistical mechanics called the multispecies exclusion process.  The exclusion process has been cited as a model for traffic flow and translation in protein synthesis.  As an application, they gave a new ``compact'' formula for Macdonald polynomials; this work appeared in the American Journal of Mathematics.  Building on this work,  the PI together with Corteel, Mandelshtam, Jim Haglund, and Sarah Mason, wrote a paper ``Compact formulas for Macdonald polynomials and quasisymmetric Macdonald polynomials,'' which recently appeared in Selecta Mathematica.  This paper gave similarly compact formulas for other transformed versions of the Macdonald polynomials; it also introduced some new quasisymmetricMacdonald polynomials which refine the Macdonald polynomials and generalize quasisymmetric Schur polynomials.\n\nThe PI together with Pavel Galashin and Alex Postnikov completed a paper ``Higher secondary polytopes and regular plabic graphs'' which recently appeared in Advances in Mathematics. Regular plabic graphs are the plabic graphs whose plabic tilings are induced from regular zonotopal tilings.  The authors showed that regular plabic graphs are essentially the same thing as the soliton graphs that arose from the work of the PI and Kodama.\n\nThe PI together with  Donghyun Kim studied the inhomogeneous multispecies exclusion process on a ring, and proved multiple formulas for steady state probabilities in terms of Schubert polynomials (International Mathematics Research Notices).\n\nThe PI together with physicists Tomasz Lukowski and Matteo Parisi completed a paper ``The positive tropical Grassmannian, the hypersimplex, and the m=2 amplituhedron,\"  which made a surprising conjecture linking the positive tropical Grassmannian and the m=2 amplituhedron, a geometric object whose volume is supposed to compute scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang Mills (high energy physics).  This conjecture was subsequently proved in the PI's joint work with Parisi and Melissa Sherman-Bennett. The authors also showed that tiles for the m=2 amplituhedron have a cluster algebra structure.\n\nThe above work lead to the PI's paper ``The positive Dressian equals the positive tropical Grassmannian,'' with David Speyer, which recently  appeared in Transactions of the American Mathematical Society.\n\nThe PI together with Robert Moerman wrote a paper ``Grass trees and forests: enumeration of Grass(mannian) trees and forests, with applications to the momentum amplituhedron,'' which gives the rank generating function for contracted plabic forests.  These objects conjecturally correspond to cells in a cell decomposition of the momentum amplituhedron.  Along the way the authors also provided an exponential-formula-style result for enumerating trees and forests whose vertices are decorated by an auxiliary function, and the authors applied their results to enumerate separable permutations.  This paper was recently accepted to Combinatorial Theory.\n\nThe PI together with Jon Boretsky and Chris Eur wrote a paper ``Polyhedral and tropical geometry of flag positroids,'' currently submitted, which studies flag positroids whose set of ranks is a sequence of consecutive numbers.  In this case the authors showed that the nonnegative tropical flag variety equals the nonnegative flag Dresssian, and that points of these spaces give rise to coherent subdivisions of flag positroid polytopes.  As a corollary, this paper shows that every positively oriented flag matroid of consecutive ranks is realizable.\n\nAdditionally, the PI wrote two survey papers.  The first survey paper is ``The positive Grassmannian, the amplituhedron, and cluster algebras,'' and was for the Proceedings of the 2022 International Congress of Mathematics.  The second survey paper is ``The combinatorics of hopping particles and positivity in Markov chains,'' and is to celebrate the 500th issue of the London Mathematical Society Newsletter.\n\nThe PI has been working hard on her book Introduction to Cluster algebras with Sergey Fomin and Andrei Zelevinsky.  The authors finished two chapters.  While much of these chapters is expository, it does include a new result, which is a presentation of any finitely-generated cluster algebra as a polynomial ring modulo the saturation of the exchange ideal.\n\nThe PI currently has seven graduate students: Charles Wang, Jonathan Boretsky, Jiyang (Johnny) Gao, Yuhan (Michelle) Jiang, Grant Barkley, Amanda Burcroff, and Victor Wang.\n\nIn 2021 the PI graduated three PhD students: Melissa Sherman-Bennett, Donghyun Kim, and Mario Sanchez.\n\nThe PI mentored five undergraduates at Harvard: Hanna Mularczyk, Fan Zhou, Amal Mattoo, Anne Larsen, and Raluca Vlad.\n\nFinally, the PI has been a mentor for the following postdoctoral fellows: Elana Kalashnikov, Mandy Cheung, Cesar Cuenca, Christian Gaetz, Anna Seigal, Christopher Eur, Matteo Parisi, and Colin Defant.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lauren Williams"
