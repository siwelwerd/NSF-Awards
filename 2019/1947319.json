 "awd_abstract_narration": "While there are many computer science initiatives for girls of color (Native Hawaiian, Alaskan Native, African American, Latinx), they often share a constraint. Specifically,  many of these programs use culturally responsive activities, which encourage community activism and have been shown to inspire girls to see themselves as entering computer-related fields, they often employ highly-general theoretical frameworks that are designed to apply to several cultural communities in a multitude of  geographic regions. But in practice, cultures, needs, and assets differ in important ways across communities and regions, so activities that work for African American girls in the US Southeast might not also work for Native Hawaiians, for instance. Without empirically validated theories and frameworks focused on specific regions and cultures, program developers, researchers, and funding agencies cannot make informed decisions as to how computer science can be for all. Particularly for Native Hawaiian and other Indigenous communities, few solutions have been offered or framed in any substantive way. Instead, theories such as Indigenous Knowledge Systems and Culturally Responsive Computing remain detached from computer science endeavors. A collective impact model for programs focused on specific communities and cultures is needed, yet there is limited understanding of what this means for computer science, girls of color, and Native Hawaiian girls, in particular. This two-year project aims to explore what is needed to identify which elements can be used to bridge that gap.   \r\n\r\nA research team that spans disciplines and geographic regions will apply two theories (Indigenous Knowledge Systems and Culturally Responsive Computing) and create a series of research opportunities to explore which features can constitute a collective impact model. Scholars from Hawai'i Pacific University, Arizona State University, and WestEd will use a particular methodology, Critical Indigenous Research Methodologies (CIRM).  Along with a cultural liaison and advisory board, adolescent (13 to 18) Native Hawaiian, Alaskan Native, African American, and Latina girls will play critical roles as researchers. The approach uses systems mapping as a tool that allows the girls to assess the system, identifying interactions and connections that both promote and prevent existing and future opportunities for success in computer science and technology. The tool establishes an opportunity for intergenerational discussions, goals, and strategies to be developed based on these findings and enables real time adaptation, learning, and action to support collective impact. \r\nThe potential for this project is significant. If successful, findings will advance theoretical and pedagogical development of curriculum and activities that intersect technology experiences with girls' of color cultural identities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Efforts to narrow or close the gender gap among elementary to high school girls include exposing them to STEM activities, discussing and interacting with successful women in STEM, and providing ways to succeed in STEM activities. Hawai'i Pacific University and the Center for Gender Equity in Science and Technology Arizona State University welcomed middle and high school girls from public schools on Oahu and the neighboring islands in June 2021 and 2022 to a residential one-week culturally responsive STEM camp. \n\nThe specific objectives were to 1) utilize culturally responsive practices in the delivery of STEM experiences, 2) measure the self-assessed interest of the camp participants in various STEM topics, in pursuing STEM majors in college, and in pursuing STEM careers after this experience; and 3) have teens engage in a Systems Mapping exercise to contribute to a collective impact model for increasing representation of women of color in STEM.\n\nIn June 2021, 34 teens participated in the residential STEM camp at Hawaii Pacific University.  This was one of the first in person opportunities to occur in Hawaii since the start of the pandemic in March 2020.  In June 2022, 36 teens participated in the residential STEM camp, including 6 2021 participants who returned in the role of peer mentors.  In both years, 7 STEM Mentor Teachers (HPU STEM graduate students or upper division undergraduate students) were trained in culturally responsive teaching practices (some mentors returned from the previous year).\n\nData were collected from surveys, focus group interviews, individual interviews, and a Systems Mapping exercise.  Most students entered the camp with a high level of interest in each area. By the conclusion of the camp there were changes, with Ecology experiencing the greatest mean increase and Astronomy &amp; Physics showing the greatest mean decrease in interest.  Most students entered the camp with a moderate level of confidence in all areas. By the end of the camp, there was an increase in confidence levels across all areas, with ecology experiencing the greatest mean increase.  Most students entered the camp with a moderate level of consideration for participating in an out-of-school STEM experience. By the conclusion of the camp, most students reported increased consideration of pursuing STEM topics with Ecology the highest mean increase and slight decrease in Astronomy &amp; Physics.  At the start of the camp, most students expressed a moderate level of consideration for taking a course in STEM areas. By the end of the camp, there was variation in change, with Ecology experiencing the greatest increase. Astronomy &amp; Physics and Marine Science experienced a slight decrease.  Coming into the camp, most students expressed a moderate level of consideration for pursuing a college degree across these STEM areas. By the end of the camp, each STEM category experienced an increase in mean responses, with Ecology experiencing the greatest increase.\n\nAn important result is the increase of student interest in pursuing a STEM major in college, across all disciplines introduced in the camp.  Also importantly, participant interest and confidence increased in computer science, the major theme of the camp.  Another interesting result was that the largest increase in STEM interest was in the field of ecology.  This may be because of the highly engaging activity at the Hawaiian fishpond, which has very high cultural relevance and community impact. Other positive impacts from this project include opportunity for these teens to experience living in college dorms and the campus environment, which can significantly reduce the stress of transitioning to college.\n\nWe note that this project was completely overhauled several times in response to the pandemic.  The proposed format was to gather representatives from indigenous cultures across the USA and the Pacific rim in a conference environment and interact with attendees of a professional conference that was scheduled concurrently-a format that quickly became impossible.  This modified version focused on students only from Hawaii with primary activities at a college campus, with ample health and safety measures employed.\n\nGoing forward, we plan to continue yet build on the current format by collaborating with other STEM programs that will allow participants of this camp to continue to engage in college and career-supportive STEM activities.  Results from this project supports that the culturally-responsive teaching approach employed for a residential STEM camp can be an impactful experience for this underrepresented group of girls and non-binary teens of color.  Further, this camp can be a part of a larger set of experiences that supports girls through their educational and career pathways, creating a network of mentors and a STEM workforce that is as diverse as the country that relies upon it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brenda A Jensen"
