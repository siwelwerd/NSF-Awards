 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hawai'i Number Theory Conference (HINT 2019) will be held March 18-21, 2019 at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa in Honolulu, HI. HINT will bring together number theorists at all levels, both from within the US and internationally, for a four-day conference that includes six plenary talks by a diverse group of established mathematicians and four breakout sessions with more narrowly focused talks with ten to twenty speakers each. Immediately preceding the AMS Joint Western and Central Sectional meeting that will also take place at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, HINT will provide opportunities for a diverse collection of number theorists to discuss recent developments, to interact, and to form new collaborations. HINT will also be a great opportunity for local number theorists at all levels to participate in a world class conference.\r\n\r\nHINT 2019 will feature six plenary talks spanning a large expanse of number theory. The special sessions are titled Algebraic number theory and Diophantine equations, Arithmetic dynamics and geometry, Arithmetic statistics and its environs, and Modular forms, respectively. They will consist of a mix of shorter and longer talks and be directed at a more specialized audience. The broader plenary talks and the mix of topics for the more focused special sessions will allow for cross-pollination between disparate areas. The conference website is http://math.hawaii.edu/HINT2019/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
