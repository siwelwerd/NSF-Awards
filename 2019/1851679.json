Such rapid changes to the labor market underscore the importance of considering innovative programs that provide financial protection to displaced workers. Wage insurance is one approach that provides both compensation for job loss and incentives to return to work. As part of the Re-Employment Trade Adjustment Assistance program, displaced workers receive up to half of the difference in wages between their old job and their new job for up to two years. The project examines how this policy influences labor market outcomes. The research specifically focuses on the amount of time people remain unemployed and their wages upon returning to work. The research, thus, is useful in exploring wage insurance as a potential alternative to standard unemployment insurance systems.\r\n \r\n \r\nUnder Re-Employment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA), workers over age 50 who lose their job to import competition can receive up to half of the difference in their pre-displacement and post-displacement earnings (\"wage insurance\"). The research uses a regression-discontinuity (RD) design based on eligibility age to estimate the causal effect of this program on labor market outcomes. Merging administrative data on trade-displaced workers with nationally representative employer-employee linked data, the project looks at the long-run effects of wage insurance on re-employment wages, unemployment durations, wage growth, and occupational quality over time at the national level. The RD estimates are used in connection with a sufficient-statistics framework to evaluate welfare effects. Workers receiving wage insurance payments may smooth consumption while accumulating human capital in a new industry or occupation. The program may, however, generate moral hazard by incentivizing workers to take lower-paying, less demanding jobs, because part of their lost wages are covered by insurance. The model quantifies the magnitude of these two effects. The project advances our understanding of wage insurance as an alternative to unemployment insurance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project examines how this policy influences labor market outcomes. The research specifically focuses on the amount of time people remain unemployed and their wages upon returning to work. The research, thus, is useful in exploring wage insurance as a potential alternative to standard unemployment insurance systems.\n \n Under Re-Employment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA), workers over age 50 who lose their job to import competition can receive up to half of the difference in their pre-displacement and post-displacement earnings (\"wage insurance\"). The research uses a regression-discontinuity (RD) design based on eligibility age to estimate the causal effect of this program on labor market outcomes, effectively comparing workers who were just too young to be eligible for wage insurance to those who were just old enough to be eligible. Merging administrative data on trade-displaced workers with nationally representative employer-employee linked data, the project examines the long-run effects of wage insurance on re-employment wages, unemployment durations, wage growth, and job quality over time at the national level.\n\nWe find that wage insurance eligibility substantially increases displaced workers\u2019 earnings in the years following displacement.  Program eligibility increases earnings by 10 percentage points relative to pre-displacement earnings and increases cumulative earnings by over $18,000 during the four years following displacement.  These earnings effects are largely driven by shorter unemployment durations among wage insurance eligible workers; wage insurance eligibility reduces the initial unemployment spell duration by approximately 1 quarter and reduces the total time out of employment across all non-employment spells by 1.26 quarters over 4 years.  We find little empirical support for other mechanisms.  These findings imply that wage insurance is a promising policy tool for supporting displaced workers.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian Kovak"
