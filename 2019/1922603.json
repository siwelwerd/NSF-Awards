The workshop will bring together approximately 150 researchers from academia, industry, and national laboratories. The workshop allows researchers in this field to network and share new developments in simulation techniques for molecules, liquids, solids, and nanomaterials. The techniques are used broadly in physics, materials science, and in chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The participants came from the United States, Korea, Germany, Italy, and Taiwan. The participants included advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and senior scientists. The general assessment of the workshop was a high level of scientific presentations and deeply useful discussions, especially at the many poster presentations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Scientific focus. </strong>The 2019 topics of invited talks were specifically selected to cover these areas:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Quantum&nbsp;chemistry on solids -&nbsp;Green function techniques<span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span class=\"s1\">Materials data - Quantum&nbsp;Monte Carlo&nbsp;-&nbsp;</span>Density functional theory</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;Applications of machine learning to electronic structure</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">This workshop series travels to a different institution within the US each year. Next year's workshop will be held at University of California Merced in June 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Principal Investigators of this award maintain a permanent archive of all available programs and names of presenters for workshops since 1989 at <a href=\"http://mcc.illinois.edu/workshops/electronicstructure/\"><span class=\"s2\">http://mcc.illinois.edu/workshops/electronicstructure/</span></a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Award outcomes.</strong> This award resulted in wider participation and professional development opportunities for junior participants. The award also contributed to freely-accessible talk materials.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">a) <strong>Wider participation.</strong> At this workshop, we had participants from several research groups who had not been attended before. These participants said that several factors related to cost influenced their decision to come:</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">1) The modest registration fee ($100)</p>\n<p class=\"p6\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"s1\">2) The NSF-sponsored housing</span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"s1\">3) The drivable distance from their home institution.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Two leaders of research groups specifically said that their budgets were very limited, but with the low cost and sponsored housing, they could afford to send one graduate student to present the group's work and to learn what other groups are doing.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">b) <strong>Professional development opportunities.</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">b.1) The Local Organizers strongly encouraged all participants to prepare and present posters for two reasons: 1) the Workshop is more useful for exchanging knowledge when more people present their work, and 2) it is important for researchers to develop their speaking and writing skills. There were several younger participants who prepared their first poster for this workshop.<span>&nbsp;</span></span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">b.2) The workshop also included a \"Meet the Editor\" session with Dr. Yan Li, an associate editor at the American Physical Society. This one-on-one time provided young participants with an opportunity to ask specific questions about publishing their research in peer-review journals, specifically <em>Physical Review B,</em> one of the important journals of the field.<span>&nbsp;</span></span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">b.3) There was also an optional hands-on tutorial on the open-source code \"Real Space Multigrid,\" given by the code developers Drs. Jerry Bernholc, Emil Briggs and Wenchang Lu from North Carolina State University. Tutorial participants set up their own laptops ahead of time and learned to run electronic structure calculations and to model materials and molecules.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">b.4) The four days included a Welcome Reception, a group luncheon, and a banquet. At these events, participants can talk more in depth about research projects, career goals, and the nature of research at different institutions in the US and abroad.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">c) <strong>Web archive. </strong>Outside of local attendance, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign maintains a permanent web archive for the workshop series, including programs, abstracts for posters and talks, and available talk slides. The website is \"</span><span class=\"s3\">Recent Developments in Electronic Structure\" at</span><span class=\"s1\"> <a href=\"http://mcc.illinois.edu/workshops/electronicstructure/\"><span class=\"s4\">http://mcc.illinois.edu/workshops/electronicstructure/</span></a>.
