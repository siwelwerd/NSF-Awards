 "awd_abstract_narration": "The quintessential question, \"How does a single, fertilized egg cell produce all the different cell types, tissues and organs of the adult organism?\", and the genetic, molecular and cellular mechanisms that conduct these complex processes are study objectives of the field of developmental biology.  The Society for Developmental Biology (previously the Society for the Study of Development and Growth) annual meetings have provided the forum for reporting of new findings, as well as exchange of ideas and cross-fertilization of new methods among developmental biologists around the World since 1939 (except for two years during WWII).  Cutting edge technologies have moved the field into the genomic era and allowed the investigators to analyze and monitor the processes leading a single fertilized egg to a complete individual, from plant to invertebrates to vertebrates including human; to understand how cells and tissues may change from normal to disease; and why some tissues are able to regenerate while others cannot.  These new technologies have also raised awareness for ethical practices and the SDB annual meetings have also provided the venue for rational discourse.  \r\n\r\nThe three annual meetings of this proposal aim to continue to be the primary meeting venue for scientists in this and related fields world-wide, with plenary and concurrent sessions with talks by seasoned and new investigators, dedicated poster sessions and workshops/roundtables on topics of special and current interest.  In keeping with the educational mission of the Society, we will offer professional development workshops for trainees and pre-tenure faculty (Boot Camp for New Faculty), education symposia, postdoctoral symposia and networking opportunities for all.  One feature that makes this meeting different from other scientific societies' meetings is the Hilde Mangold Postdoctoral Symposium, where two postdoctoral fellows review all eligible abstracts from their peers, select the top eight for short talks and co-chair the symposium.  They practice peer review and session chairmanship under the mentoring of the SDB president, a critical career training for these junior scientists.  We also will focus to provide a welcoming, inclusive and respectful atmosphere for the participants, to encourage frank exchange of ideas and fomenting of future collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

There are plenary and concurrent sessions, special interest and postdoctoral symposia, workshops on education, new methods and research areas, poster sessions, theme table discussions, and various opportunities for the budding scientists to meet and interact with the more senior investigators. This current grant supported the meetings held from 2019 in Boston to 2022 in Vancouver, including the two COVID pandemic years (2020 and 2021) as virtual events.\n\n\nThe Boston meeting, celebrating the Societys 80th Birthday, was one of the largest held, with 949 registrants from 26 different countries.
