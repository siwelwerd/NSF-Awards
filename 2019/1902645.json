 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geometric partial differential equations describe the fundamental laws of the universe, from gravity to electromagnetism to fluid flow and the equations of motion of string theory.  It is a fundamental fact that these equations do not always admit solutions.  Understanding when solutions do and do not exist provides deep insights into the nature of our universe; for example, we can narrow down the possible shapes of the universe, or the kinds of behaviors charged particles in space might exhibit.  This project aims to understand these problems, and their connections to underlying algebraic structures in a variety of settings connected with high-energy physics, and string theory.\r\n \r\nThe PI plans to investigate several problems studying the relationship between existence and regularity problems for geometric PDEs on complex manifolds and algebraic geometry.  The three main settings in which this will be carried out are the existence problem for the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation, which describes BPS D-Branes on the B-side of mirror symmetry, the Kahler-Ricci flow and connections to the minimal model program, and the existence of canonical destabilizers in the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture for Fano manifolds.  Each of these directions involves relating estimates for elliptic/parabolic PDEs and algebraic geometry through techniques involving birational geometry, geometric invariant theory and Riemannian convergence theory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This project aimed to address mathematical questions at the interface of differential geometry, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.   In total, 10 publications resulted from this award, some of which will be described below.\n Part of the project focused on problems arising from mirror symmetry, a conjectural picture in mathematics which arises from a certain deep duality in string theory.  Roughly speaking, mirror symmetry predicts that certain spaces, called Calabi-Yau manifolds, occur in pairs.  Moreover, these pairs have the property that they effectively interchange different branches of mathematics (namely, symplectic and complex geometry).  This duality is mysterious, but Strominger-Yau-Zaslow (SYZ) described a conjectural picture for how to construct mirror pairs.  In two publications, joint with A. Jacob and Y.-S. Lin, the PI verified the SYZ conjecture for certain four dimensional Calabi-Yau spaces with infinite volume and diameter.  This work yielded interesting connections with classical algebraic geometry. \n Mirror symmetry also describes sets of special objects which play an important role in string theory.  An important, and largely open question is: when do these special objects exist?  Can we describe, or parametrize them somehow?.  The PI and S.-T. Yau approached this question by using classical ideas from Geometric Invariant Theory in an infinite dimensional setting.  This work results in 3 publications, detailing some concrete conditions which predict the existence, or non-existence of these special objects.  \n In another project, joint with R. Berman and D.
