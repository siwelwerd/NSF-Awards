 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nearly all Americans participate in physical rehabilitation therapy at some point in their lifespan. Physical therapy can be highly effective in alleviating pain and restoring function, however only a third of physical therapy patients fully adhere to their plans of care. Future gains in improving the effectiveness of physical therapy will require patient-specific monitoring of the accuracy and frequency of therapeutic exercises. However, low-cost ways to accurately monitor therapeutic exercise do not currently exist. The goal of this project is to use cutting-edge advances in nano-composite sensor, artificial intelligence, and communication technologies to develop an affordable, wearable, sensing system for monitoring physical rehabilitative therapy exercises for patients who have recently had a total knee replacement (TKR). These key characteristics will be used to provide instant biofeedback to patients and clinicians, inside or outside of the traditional physical therapy clinic. The new wearable sensing system will be used to monitor therapeutic exercise on an individual and population scale, facilitating the creation of a massive and previously unattainable database of therapeutic exercise characteristics. Further, results from this project will have application in any context where real-life characterization of human movement is important, for example, worksite safety or athletic performance. This project will involve numerous graduate and undergraduate research assistants pursuing careers in engineering or science, as well as undergraduate research assistants pursuing careers in medicine or physical therapy. It is also anticipated that the resulting wearable sensing system will be used as a teaching tool in physical therapy curricula, an application that will be evaluated in this project.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to engineer and evaluate a wearable nano-biosensing system that leverages recent development by the investigators in the area of skin-like nano-composite sensors, as a new approach to characterize the biomechanics of physical rehabilitation performed by patients during self-guided and clinician controlled physical therapy. The guiding hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Wearable nano-biosensing systems based upon a 3D network of piezoresponsive sensors can be designed with adequate resolution of kinematics to identify and characterize physical rehabilitation exercises; 2)The mechanical characteristics of self-guided physical rehabilitation exercises are fundamentally different from the mechanical characteristics of physical rehabilitation exercises performed under the direct supervision of a clinician and 3) Combining biofeedback with a wearable nano-biosensing system can quantitatively and qualitatively decrease differences between self-guided and clinician-supervised physical rehabilitation.  The Research Plan is organized under three objectives related to these hypotheses.  The FIRST Objective is to undertake the materials science and engineering research required to create and validate a 3D wearable, nanocomposite biosensing system whose hardware and software components will be encapsulated into a Mobile Environment of Nanosensors for Tracking Out-of-clinic Rehabilitation (MENTOR). The system will be designed to fully capture the kinematics and kinetics of rehabilitation exercises for post total knee replacement (TKR) recovery.  High sensitivity, elastomer-based nanocomposite strain sensors will be positioned in a system of 2D sensing membranes whose response can be accurately interpreted in terms of 3D joint kinematics. Smart insoles to capture ground reaction forces (GRF)) will be expanded to include piezoresistive pressure sensing of static forces in order to detect stance during rehabilitation exercises in addition to GRF while walking and running.  The SECOND Objective is to measure, validate, and compare lower-extremity biomechanics of clinician-guided outpatient rehabilitation exercises with that of the same patients performing the same exercises in a self-guided setting independent of direct clinician supervision.  Biomechanics will be measured using both traditional motion analysis tools and the MENTOR wearable sensing system.  The THIRD Objective is to measure and compare the biomechanics of clinician-guided outpatient rehabilitation exercises with that of the same patients performing the same exercises, self-guided, with and without realtime biofeedback when using the MENTOR wearable sensing system. The wearable MENTOR system will be combined with a simple, smartphone-based biofeedback system whose purpose is to assist the patients in correctly performing the rehabilitation exercises at the desired quality (similar biomechanical characteristics) and quantity (e.g., desired number of sets and repetitions). A simple Knee Motion Dashboard will provide the patient and clinician with quantitative sensor information regarding rehabilitation progress.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

MENTOR is a new sensing system designed for total knee replacement patients to use while performing physical therapy exercises outside of a traditional physical therapy clinic, away from direct supervision of a licensed physical therapist (Figure 1). &nbsp;The heart of the MENTOR system is a novel motion sensing knee sleeve capable of measuring accurate 3D knee motion during various exercises that are often prescribed after knee replacement surgery (Figure 2). The sleeve contains an array of nano-composite sensors connected via Bluetooth to a smart-phone app that can provide instant visual and audio biofeedback to the patient. After honing the MENTOR design across approximately forty healthy subjects from various age groups, rollout of the system for total knee replacement patients has begun. Initial feedback indicates that the system helps patients to achieve rehabilitation targets with the help of the biofeedback (Figure 3) and does not cause discomfort.</p>\n<p>Different biofeedback strategies were tested for efficacy and subject preference across twenty-one healthy subjects. While visual, audio and haptic (vibration) feedback had similar average efficacy, the visual feedback was preferred by the subjects, with the audio feedback placing second (Figure 4). A combination of visual and audible feedback was implemented in the MENTOR system.</p>\n<p>Engineering of the kinematic-sensing knee sleeve required tailoring the the response of individual nano-composite strain gauges, followed by system optimization of the positioning and orientation of an array of 16 of these sensors across the surface of the knee joint.&nbsp; Finally, the response of the complete MENTOR system to varying loads during physical therapy exercises was characterized. The non-linear response of the sensors needed to be ?learned? by a machine-learning model from calibration data obtained from a high-speed motion capture system (Figure 2). In practical use scenarios, each new patient performs a short calibration exercise (Figure 1) to provide a real-time tuning of the model to capture their specific motion characteristics. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>A novel pressure sensing insole was also developed for inclusion in future iterations of the MENTOR system, in collaboration with XO-Nano (a startup company spinning out of BYU; Figure 5). The nano-composite foam can measure quasi-static load applied to the feet during standing exercises (such as weight shifting) or dynamic load applied during walking or running exercises.</p>\n<p>Six graduate students and twenty undergraduate students from the Departments of Mechanical Engineering, Exercise Sciences, and Statistics have contributed to the multidisciplinary project. There has been a heavy emphasis on mentoring of students at different levels, for successful careers in STEM and bio related areas. Several of the students are already working in industry, post-doctoral academic positions, medical school, and physical therapy school. Also, the MENTOR system and associated technologies have formed the focus of several outreach biomechanics showcases for k-12 students and adults.

Furthermore, the technology may be used to mitigate negative effects of other diseases that affect human movement (e.g., muscular dystrophy which affects approximately 250,000 Americans, or traumatic brain injury which affects approximately 3 million Americans annually). Outside of medicine, the advances can be applied to any context in which continuous measurement of force and/or motion using a compliant force sensor could be beneficial (e.g., work-place safety and or athletic performance improvement).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/27/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Anton&nbsp;Bowden</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1901845/1901845_10614610_1698427899013_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1901845/1901845_10614610_1698427899013_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1901845/1901845_10614610_1698427899013_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Calibration of the MENTOR knee sleeve (left) with audible instructions from the app. Using the MENTOR system (right) with both visual and audible feedback from the smartphone app.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kurt Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;T&nbsp;Fullwood</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1901845/1901845_10614610_1698428139246_Slide2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1901845/1901845_10614610_1698428139246_Slide2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1901845/1901845_10614610_1698428139246_Slide2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A) The MENTOR sleeve and reflective markers for motion capture analysis.
