 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program and SBE's Political Science program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Drs. Richard Howarth and Michael Cox at Dartmouth College, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating regulatory transitions and forest management outcomes in the Global South. Canonical research concludes that self-organized groups can generate norms and rules (i.e. institutions) that enable the sustainable management of forest areas. To promote forest conservation, many governments across the Global South have rapidly decentralized forest management. As a result, these same governments have witnessed a rapid rise in the number of administrative units that conduct regulatory activities. Despite these processes of decentralization and administrative proliferation in the Global South, forest loss continues to increase. The relationship between regulatory transition and institutional stability provides an important link between the theory of how self-organized user-groups have managed forest resources for long-term sustainability and the current trends of increased decentralization and forest cover loss in the Global South. Regulatory transition refers to a period during which rules, regulations, or administrations change. Behavioral uncertainty often increases during regulatory transition, which can lead to outcomes that may differ drastically from periods of institutional stability. Through the study of how regulatory transition affects forest outcomes in the Global South, this research advances fundamental research in social, economic, and behavioral sciences.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates the extent of regulatory transition and its impact on forest related outcomes across scales. First, it utilizes publicly available, global datasets to quantify the extent of forest cover in the Global South that experienced different forms of regulatory transition over the past two decades (2000 to 2020). This analysis will assess the years during which forest management was decentralized, and the extent to which sub-national administrative units have proliferated. Second, this research will analyze the impact of regulatory transition on forest cover and multidimensional poverty. This analysis will use panel data and causal inference techniques to understand how regulatory transition affects forest cover. Third, this research will assess the causal mechanisms by which regulatory transition affects forest outcomes through the collection and analysis of interview data. Decentralization and proliferation provide a unique opportunity to understand how and why forest cover change has occurred as a result of regulatory transition in one of the most important countries for tropical forest conservation. The combination of these three analyses will provide a comprehensive study of when, how, and why regulatory transition leads to changes in forest resources. In doing so, it promises to advance scholarship on institutional analysis and natural resource policy and behavior.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over the course of this postdoctoral fellowship, Dr. Erbaugh published 10 peer reviewed articles with an international group of co-authors working at academic institutions and NGOs in the United States and Indonesia; he mentored five Indonesian undergraduate students at the Institut Pertanian Bogor and four American undergraduate students at Dartmouth College in environmental social science research methods; he taught three undergraduate courses in the Department of Environmental Studies at Dartmouth College; and he made six research presentations. The research, mentorship, and professional successes from this fellowship provide a foundation for a strong research career at the intersection of natural resource management and sustainable development.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The findings from this fellowship demonstrate the importance of identifying and assessing regulatory dispersal related to forest management. For example, Erbaugh et al (2020) find that 294 million people live in areas with high forest restoration potential in the Global South. Within low and lower-middle income countries, 16% of the population live in areas with great potential for forest restoration. These populations often include the most impoverished and vulnerable communities within the poorest countries, and such communities often rely on rely upon forest resources for their livelihood and wellbeing directly. Despite high reliance on such forest resources (Hajjar et al 2021), rights to access and manage resources are not often afforded to communities. Instead, forestlands are typically managed through government policies and interactions between national, sub-national (i.e. states/counties, provinces/districts, etc.), and local (i.e. county, village, etc.) administrations. Providing forest resource rights to communities often requires the navigation of government administration at and between different levels (Sahide et al 2020, Harbi 2020). This can result in the dispersal of regulation that, on one hand, improves the transparency of forest resource management because communities near forest resources often have better information and are more directly impacted by forest change. On the other hand, regulatory dispersal increases implementation and transaction costs, individuals may not have the same level of technical knowledge as individuals in government administration, and localized management may be subject to elite capture (Erbaugh 2019).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This fellowship examined the impacts of regulatory dispersal and forest resources in the Global South through secondary and primary research. It provides evidence that regulatory dispersal does not necessarily lead to improvements in conservation or local livelihoods and wellbeing, even when projects or policies focus on communities and sustainable development (Erbaugh 2022). Thus, evaluating the processes through which regulatory rather than assessing project objectives or the incentive mechanisms that a policy incorporates must be of primary importance when assessing the impacts of regulatory dispersal on forest resources (Erbaugh 2020, Erbaugh 2022). To contribute to better understanding the role of regulatory dispersal and forest change, the research from this fellowship continues to advance methods to identify where regulatory dispersal has occurred through the identification of changing administrative boundaries. It has also led to establishing a strong foundation for continued study of regulatory dispersal and natural resource outcomes in the Global South by contributing a primary dataset of forest management adaptations from Bahasa Indonesia sources; spatial data on forest change and local administrative change in Ghana, Nepal, and Indonesia; and data from an experiment that measures Indonesian citizen?s willingness to pay for climate-smart development that promotes forest resource conservation based on different facilitation strategies. Future research on this topic will incorporate the role of deliberative democracy, community governance, and forest access to build on the successes and insights from this postdoctoral fellowship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>Erbaugh, J.T., Pradhan, N., Adams, J., Oldekop, J.A., Agrawal, A., Brockington, D., Pritchard, R., Chhatre, A., 2020.
