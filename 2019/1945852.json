 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports student travel to the International Conference on Developments in Language Theory (May 11-15, 2020) which is held in conjunction with a workshop on Discrete and Topological Models in Molecular Biology during the same period at the University of South Florida, Tampa FL. The project funds travel of graduate students and junior researchers. The conference is organized in the USA for the first time since 2006. These meetings bring together a wide range of speakers from all around the world, from leading theoretical computer scientists through theoreticians who actively collaborate with experimentalists. A significant component of the two events is aimed toward young researchers and graduate students through tutorials, poster sessions, and panel discussions. One of the goals of the conference is to promote interaction among graduate students and junior PhDs from around the world and from different disciplines, as these interactions often result in long-lasting research collaborations and are consequently highly beneficial for the development of the field. The PI had significant success in attracting women and students from underrepresented groups in the past organized conferences and plans to follow similar strategies to increase participation from diverse backgrounds, specifically minorities and underrepresented groups.\r\n \r\nThe conference covers the field of theoretical computer science focused on combinatorial and algebraic properties of words and languages including topics on string patterns in biomolecules; bio-inspired computing; quantum computing; symbolic descriptions of pictures and their analysis; acceptors and transducers for strings, trees, graphs, arrays; theory of codes; efficient text algorithms; symbolic dynamics and cellular automata; decision problems; relationships to complexity theory and logic; polyominoes and bi-dimensional patterns; cryptography and concurrency.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
