 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Undergraduate Biology Education Research (UBER) will allow a critical mass of scholars who study how improvements in undergraduate biology education can be scaled to assemble. The five-day conference will provide opportunities for thought leaders in the UBER community to gather in an environment that encourages collaborative, face-to-face conversations about the future of the field and how the community can address emerging opportunities, challenges, and important questions.\r\n\r\nThe GRC will foster the next generation of ideas for accelerating biology education research, informing national priorities, and promoting the scaling of evidence-based practices. To meet these goals, this important national gathering aims to: 1) expose a diverse assemblage of attendees to state-of-the-art approaches for teaching biology; 2) engender deep discussions about contemporary issues that will improve undergraduate biology research; and, 3) continue the development of a common language and conceptual understanding of issues related to scaling implementation of evidence-based practices in undergraduate biology education. The conference will facilitate the synthesis of research findings and the formation of new collaborations and research strands that will lead to improved biology learning for hundreds of thousands of students enrolled in diverse biology programs. The PI and advisory committee will invite participants who have recently taken on leadership positions within the higher educational system and future biology education researchers. The latter will participate in the affiliated Graduate Research Seminar, a two-day pre-meeting focused on mentoring and supporting graduate students and post-docs who represent the next generation of biology education research professionals. The collective efforts of conference attendees will help sustain and improve undergraduate biology education well into the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Gordon Research Conference on Undergraduate Biology Education Research (UBER) was held at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine during June 23-28, 2019.  A total of 195 biology faculty, government officials, early-career biologists and students as well as established experts in the field of Undergraduate Biology Education attended the third in the series of UBER GRCs.  This GRC was well represented by women and minority attendees with approximately 76% of all registrants being female.  \n Intellectual Merit: The conference assembled national experts that helped the next generation of questions and issues that will accelerate national priorities in STEM education, in general, and biology education, in particular.  This third version of the UBER Gordon conference focused on, 1) exposing a diverse assemblage of attendees to state-of-the-art approaches to UBER; 2) engendering deep discussions about contemporary issues that will accelerate UBER; and, 3) continuing the development of a common language and conceptual understanding of issues related to scaling change in the UBER community.  The evaluation of the conference suggested that the presentations and conversations that took place during the week-long event resulted in identifying many of the gaps in our understanding of UBER and the development of new research collaborations and research strands that will lead to improved undergraduate biology learning by an increasingly diverse community of students.\n\nBroader Impacts: The conference gave an opportunity for leaders in the UBER field to intimately interact with peers, graduate students and early-career faculty.  The ideas and collaborations will impact many thousands of students, particularly those that are underrepresented in science and those attending two-year institutions in the years to come.  The conference also invited conference participants who have recently taken on leadership positions within our educational system, and future UBER professional.  The latter being supported by the affiliated Graduate Research Seminar (GRS), a two-day pre-meeting focused on mentoring and supporting UBER graduate students and post-docs who represent the next generation of UBER professionals.  Collectively, the conference addressed several opportunities and a few intractable problems in undergraduate biology that define how biology education improves and scales over the next few years. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/04/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jose Herrera"
