 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Mathematics at the University of Notre Dame will run a 2019 program on Commutative Algebra and Its Interactions with Algebraic Geometry and a 2020 program on p-adic L-functions and Eigenvarieties. In 2019, the program will consist of an undergraduate summer school from May 28 to June 1, a graduate level summer school from June 3 to June 14, and an international research conference from June 16 to June 21. In 2020, the program will consist of a one week undergraduate summer school, a one week graduate level summer school, and a one week conference. The purpose of the programs is to introduce students at various levels to important ideas in commutative algebra and in number theory, which are both active and central areas of mathematics with many connections to other areas of mathematics and to science. The goal of the undergraduate week is to expose undergraduates to fundamental ideas they would not normally see until graduate school. We will introduce material through a combination of lectures and active learning sessions, with the aim of inspiring students to take advanced courses or reading courses when they return to university.  The graduate summer schools are geared towards graduate students in the field,  and will be followed by a conference which will present current research on topics developed in the earlier weeks. The goal is to inspire graduate students to explore connections between different areas of mathematics, beyond the level they may see in their own graduate program. We also hope to bring together graduate students and postdocs from different institutions so they can develop productive professional relationships. We note that many students from previous Center for Mathematics at Notre Dame programs have gone on to get a Ph.D. in mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the program Commutative Algebra and Its Interactions with Algebraic Geometry is to educate undergraduates and to bring together researchers interested in the area. The first week will introduce useful techniques and examples amenable to calculation. The graduate summer school will introduce cutting edge topics and computational tools using the Macaulay2 program, and the conference will emphasize exciting new research developments. The topics for the 2020 program on p-adic L-functions and Eigenvarieties are not completely set, but will include an interactive program for students, and advanced topics such as the Iwasawa main conjecture, the exceptional zero conjecture, and eigenvarieties.\r\n\r\nThe program website is available at www3.nd.edu/~cmnd/programs/https://centerformath.nd.edu/scientific-events-and-programs/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant helped support participants at two multi-week programs, which were held in 2019 and 2022.   The 2019 program was in commutative algebra.   Commutative algebra provides the language mathematicians need to study polynomial equations and associated geometry.   The 2019 program included a one week program for undergraduates which introduced students to important topics in the field which most students do not learn until graduate school.    The following two weeks consisted of programs for graduate students in commutative algebra, and one week was largely funded by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute.   These summer schools introduced students to cutting edge ideas in the subject, and students were also educated in computational methods in the subject.   The lectures have produced a book by Linquan Ma and Thomas Poelstra called \"F-Singularities: a commutative algebra approach\" which is becoming a standard reference in the field.   Claudia Polini has also written a survey article on \"Defining equations of blowup algebras\" based on her lectures at this summer school and at another summer school in Italy.    The conference included talks by senior leaders in commutative algebra as well as talks by rising stars.    Survey results indicated that students were highly satisfied by the programs.    The 2022 program was in number theory, which is the area of mathematics which investigates fundamental questions about the integers.   This program was delayed for two years due to pandemic restrictions.   It was a three week program with a one week undergraduate summer school, a one week graduate summer school, and a one week conference.     The specific topics were about p-adic L-functions and modular forms.    The undergraduate program introduced the students to fundamental topics in number theory, and in particular to connecting elliptic curves to modular forms.   Students learned how to apply computational methods to answer questions in number theory.   The graduate summer school educated participants in state-of-the-art developments in p-adic L-functions, eigenvarieties, and Galois representations, which are all fundamental tools in number theory.   The conference included a number of talks by leading researchers in the field.  The intellectual merit of the programs is evident in the high level of mathematics that was presented.    The broader impact lies largely in the training of  students, and in encouraging undergraduates from underrepresented groups to consider graduate student, which has helped Notre Dame get two successful graduate students.   Both programs included sessions for undergraduates on how to apply for graduate school, which helps these fields attract students and helps students decide on a future path.    Lecture notes are available for both conferences on the internet, and videos of the 2022 conference are available via youtube, and as a consequence impact others who were not able to attend the programs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Samuel R Evens"
