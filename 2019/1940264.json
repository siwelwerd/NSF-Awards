 "awd_abstract_narration": "Projected environmental changes, including sea level rise and increased frequency and intensity of storm events, are leading to rapid departures from past trends. However, the ability to model, predict, and understand the impacts of these changes is extremely limited. This is especially of great concern for coastal cities with high population density, valuable properties and tax base, and extremely vulnerable and underserved communities. This is a complex problem requiring an integrated approach that accounts for potential physical, ecological and socioeconomic impacts of projected environmental change. Therefore, goal of this conference to bring together an interdisciplinary group of experts to develop an Integrated Environmental Modeling system. A single model cannot simulate every potential impact, so numerous models have been developed to address subsets of these effects. Conference participants will focus on developing an integrated approach by addressing the interoperability of the various models across social, ecological, and physical factors. The conference will include a diverse group of participants, with a specific emphasis on recruiting students and stakeholders from vulnerable, underserved communities. \r\n\r\nResults based on model simulations play a pivotal role in understanding vulnerabilities of both natural and built environments in coastal regions. Land- based models that simulate flooding due to sea level rise, storm surge, waves, inland rainfall, and, in some cases, groundwater levels are maturing. Models for predicting economic losses due to property damage and service interruptions are also being developed. Discussions are also underway for how to model human behavior in coastal environments in the presence of increasing frequency of flooding that is expected from enhanced stresses and shocks due to projected environmental changes. This Coastlines and People conference will review the current state of each category of models, their requirements in terms of spatial and temporal resolution of information necessary for integrated assessment and, more importantly, develop an appropriate coastal observation system to test and improve the interoperability of these models. Conference participants will provide guidance on interoperability that can serve as a \"standard of practice\" among the modeling community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
