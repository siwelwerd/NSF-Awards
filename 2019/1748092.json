 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transportation infrastructure plays a crucial role in economic development by enhancing connectivity between places, resulting in both positive and negative impacts on the local environment and communities. The impacts of roads are most evident in Arctic and Subarctic regions, which are characterized by increased economic activity, an extremely fragile environment, and Indigenous villages often dependent on subsistence activities. In many remote Arctic regions, formal roads are rare, and transportation infrastructure consists predominantly of trails and paths established by Indigenous people for subsistence purposes as well as temporary roads laid out for resource exploration. Although such informal roads are usually unchartered, the impacts of the development and implementation of these informal roads have yet to be significantly explored.\r\n\r\nThis project is a detailed interdisciplinary analysis of the overall impact of informal transportation routes on the Arctic socioecological system. The expected project results will contribute to planning for sustainable development of Arctic and Subarctic regions, which are experiencing unprecedented anthropogenic and climate-induced changes. It will also generate scientific knowledge for complex assessment of the positive and negative impacts of development and tourism on other remote regions of the world. This goal will be addressed through the following project objectives: 1) Map and analyze the evolution of spatial extent and condition of formal and informal roads using a range of remote sensing products, archival work, and local knowledge; 2) Assess the importance and use of different types of roads for diverse population groups using field observations and in-depth interviews; 3) Provide an integrative assessment of the informal roads' impacts on socio-economic  and environmental conditions of local communities; and 4) Work closely with local communities to develop plan for sustainable development and use of transportation infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

But it also pollutes the environment and has a significant impact on local cultures. Roads serve as agents of change, representing highly complex, constantly evolving networks or systems. These systems combine numerous socio-economic, environmental, and technological factors and processes, necessitating continuous maintenance. For remote Arctic and Subarctic communities, transportation pathways include not only general access automobile roads, but also traditional trails and paths increasingly used by motorized vehicles. They also include technological and abandoned roads originally made for industrial purposes.</p>\n<p>Despite these realities, there remains a knowledge gap in understanding the impact of increased accessibility and transportation infrastructure (e.g., formal and informal roads) on the fragile environment and economic, social, and cultural wellbeing of local communities. This project aimed to understand the environmental, social, economic, and cultural impact of the development, maintenance, and use of \"informal roads\" and their overall impact on the sustainability of remote communities.</p>\n<p>Informal roads are an inevitable part of human presence in landscapes, serving as a means of transportation and communication. Their rapid development indicates uncontrolled extractive development, landscape fragmentation, and other environmental and societal disturbances. Arctic regions are often considered roadless and, as such, key refugia for biodiversity, providing globally relevant ecosystem services. However, in such assessments, only official roads are usually counted due to the lack of resources to control and formalize existing infrastructure, insignificance from the position of decision-makers, or their illegal nature.</p>\n<p>Researchers conducted both fieldwork and analysis of geospatial data to identify, map, and characterize informal road networks in the Baikal region in Russia and the Khovsgol aimag in Mongolia (Figures 1 and 2). The primary function of a road plays a significant role in its impact on landscapes and serves as a proxy of power relations between different actors and relations between humans and landscapes (Figure 3). This project shows that informal roads constitute 84.8% of the total road length in the area of study (Figure 4). We found a higher probability of fire ignition near forestry roads than near geophysical line clearings. We also found no wildfire ignition points within 300 m of roads exclusively used for subsistence by local residents (Figure 5). With climate change, the development of an informal road network exacerbates permafrost degradation and lengthening seasons of wildfires, increasing occurrences of \"zombie fires\".</p>\n<p>The project provides evidence of the substantial and multifaceted effects that informal road networks exert on social-ecological systems and landscape sustainability. It serves as an example of social-ecological-technological systems (SETS). The results are relevant for different groups of actors and different scales. The members of local communities, as partners of the research, significantly shaped the focus of the research, drawing attention to the importance of interaction between wildfires and different informal roads. The results can be useful for other regions with extractive industries and tourism development. The project has a strong educational component, involving students, early career scholars, local schools, and stakeholders. The mapathon session at GWU allowed several dozen students to learn about road patterns in Siberian taiga. The results were presented at domestic and international conferences <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-52a38308-7fff-f85e-9064-e3dc95ee4773\"><span>(AAG, AGU, ASSW, IASSA, </span><span>ASEEES</span><span>)&nbsp;</span></span>and published in peer-reviewed journals <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-85ecd9be-7fff-320a-4b0d-eb4c76c5e4b5\"><span>(</span><span>Environmental Research Letters, Sustainability, Arctic Science, Land, GeoHazards, Eurasian Geography and Economics, Resources)</span></span>.
