 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of students and indigenous peoples in a plenary panel at the 2019 annual meeting of the Society for Economic Botany (SEB). The meeting will be hosted by the University of Cincinnati on June 2-6, 2019. The theme of the meeting is, \"The Future of Forests: Perspectives from Indigenous Peoples, Traditional Practices, and Conservation.\" It is well-known that the world's forests are important for a sustainable economic future, it is also the case that they are threatened by increased demand for forest products, population growth, climate change, and uncertain fire suppression policies. Globally and nationally, there are ongoing debates on various topics about forest management including sustainability, biodiversity, and economic impacts. This timely panel brings together anthropologists, foresters, botanists, and ecologists to discuss forest management on four continents from multiple perspectives.\r\n\r\nThe panelists include ethno-ecologists, whose research highlights indigenous agroforest management practices. Cultural anthropology provides a unifying theoretical perspective and a set of methodological approaches, including participant observation and linguistic competency, which underpin the research of the presenters. Participation in the meeting will enable students to gain invaluable experience at an international meeting, assimilate new idea, and expand their professional networks and opportunities for collaboration. The conference organizers anticipate publication of the plenary panel and selected organized sessions in a special volume of Economic Botany.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The theme of the symposium was a response to the numereous threats to our forested lands that are developing across the globe.&nbsp; At this moment in history our forests are under duress because of the unceasing demand for forest products, fire suppression in many areas, increased human population in places previously forested, and rapidly changing climatic patterns that alter the conditions under which forest ecosystems have evolved and adapted. On both national and international scales, the debate over whether forests should be managed to promote sustainability and preserve biodiversity or simply maximize economic return, is a topic of heated discussion that is occurring widely. During the&nbsp; plenary session, our diverse group of speakers (see below), which included anthropologists, foresters, botanists, and ecologists addressed the topic of forest management on four continents from an eclectic set of multicultural perspectives. Significantly, this approach facilitated a more integrative discussion of this issue than that found at other meetings that focused on forest conservation. Additional organized sessions at the SEB meeting also expanded on this theme. Funding provided by NSF enabled us to support the travel expenses for our invited speakers and for graduate students who desired to attend this exciting and culturally relevant meeting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Plenary Panel:</span></strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>M.

Senior Vice President, Science and Conservation, and Ethnobotanist, Missouri Botanical Garden (MBG); discussed his indigenous community-driven reforestation project in Madagascar.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Teresa Culley</strong>... Professor, Biology, UC; discussed her research on urban landscapers overuse of Callery pears, an ornamental tree type. Although the trees were introduced by nursery growers as sterile hybrids, they rapidly reproduce and have invaded many forest tracts in the northeastern US, leading to their re-classification as an invasive species.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The principal intellectual merit of the meeting was that it brought together scientists from divergent fields of study whose research was relevant to the topic of how to manage and conserve our precious global forest resources. Cultural anthropology offers a unifying theoretical perspective and a set of methodological approaches, including participant observation and linguistic competency, which underpined the research of all of the presenters. Among the panelists, three were ethnoecologists whose research highlights indigenous forest management practices and what they can teach us about sustainable agroforestry. These approaches were highly relevant to the members of the SEB, as demonstrated by their awarding of the Distinguished Economic Botanist Award to anthropologically oriented social scientists for the last two years (Dr. Roy Ellen of the School of Anthropology and Conservation at the University of Canterbury, UK, and Dr. Gary Nabhan, W.K. Kellogg Chair of Social Science, University of Arizona). The SEB continued this pattern at our meeting in 2019, when it named Dr. John Rashford, Department of Anthropology, College of Charleston, as the Distinguished Economic Botanist.</p>\n<p>In terms of broader impacts, the 2019 SEB meeting brought together students and professionals from several fields of study. Significantly, we deliberately convened anthropologists, museum curators, resource managers, and scientists who are addressing human-forest dynamics from a range of perspectives. Not only is the exchange of ideas important, free flowing and intellectually stimulating, but the opportunities for collaboration and establishing new research connections was substantial. Participation in the meeting was especially important for students because it enabled them to expand their professional networks, opportunities for collaboration, assimilate new ideas, and discover meaningful career opportunities. To encourage broader student participation, we provided funding to support student travel to the meeting. We also held&nbsp; a mentoring lunch for students, a tradition of past SEB meetings. We actively recruited students of diverse ethnicity to contribute papers and presentations to help advance their careers as professionals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/24/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;L&nbsp;Lentz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1915827/1915827_10593939_1593013385558_POsterSEBbest--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1915827/1915827_10593939_1593013385558_POsterSEBbest--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Poster advertising the symposium\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1915827/1915827_10593939_1593013385558_POsterSEBbest--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Poster advertising the symposium\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This was the first public announcement of the symposium entitled, \"The Future of Forests: Perspectives from Indigenous People, Traditional Practices and Conservation.\" An early version of this appeared at the 2018 Society for Economic Botany meeting in Madison, Wis.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Lentz</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;L&nbsp;Lentz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Poster advertising the symposium</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1915827/1915827_10593939_1592942312881_DrDockrygivesplenarytalk--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1915827/1915827_10593939_1592942312881_DrDockrygivesplenarytalk--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Plenary Speaker, Dr. Dockry\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1915827/1915827_10593939_1592942312881_DrDockrygivesplenarytalk--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Plenary Speaker, Dr. Dockry\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. Michael Dockry, a member of the Potawatami Nation and invited plenary speaker, presents his lecture on Native American forest management.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Lentz</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;L&nbsp;Lentz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Plenary Speaker, Dr. Dockry</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1915827/1915827_10593939_1592943436358_UCcampusatdusk--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1915827/1915827_10593939_1592943436358_UCcampusatdusk--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"University of Cincinnati, host of the meeting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1915827/1915827_10593939_1592943436358_UCcampusatdusk--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"University of Cincinnati, host of the meeting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The University of Cincinnati hosted the 2019 meeting of the Society for Economic Botany and the NSF-sponsored symposium entitled, \"The Future of Forests.\"</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Lentz</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;L&nbsp;Lentz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">University of Cincinnati, host of the meeting</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1915827/1915827_10593939_1593015816876_Archaeobotworkshop--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1915827/1915827_10593939_1593015816876_Archaeobotworkshop--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ethnobotanical workshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1915827/1915827_10593939_1593015816876_Archaeobotworkshop--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ethnobotanical workshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">One of many workhops offered to participants of the SEB meeting, this event focused on wild plants and native cultivars of Eastern North America.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Lentz</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;L&nbsp;Lentz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ethnobotanical workshop</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1915827/1915827_10593939_1593015935250_FtAncientfieldtrip--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1915827/1915827_10593939_1593015935250_FtAncientfieldtrip--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Field Trip to Ft.
