 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)\r\nPhase I project is to save lives through the proliferation of miniaturized automated external\r\ndefibrillators that attach to smartphones. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) will kill more than 325,000\r\nAmericans this year outside of the hospital. An SCA can cause death if it is not treated in\r\nminutes. If an AED is available, it can save a person's life; some estimates suggest a 27% increase\r\nin the number of people who could be saved if AEDs are available and used when needed. A\r\nminiaturized AED embedded in a smartphone case could save lives by making AEDs more\r\navailable and ensuring those who carry them are reachable by emergency medical services. The\r\nstrategy is to equip law enforcement, firefighters, EMS personnel, and potential citizen first responders\r\nwith this device and use smartphone technology to ensure they are reachable when\r\nin proximity to someone experiencing an SCA. It provides an opportunity for a new paradigm in\r\nfirst response: AED carriers that can be located during the first critical moments of an SCA.\r\nThrough this research, hundreds of thousands of lives can be saved each year.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will prove out the concept of a\r\nregulatory-compliant miniaturized AED that integrates with a smartphone. The work includes\r\nresearching and designing components and electronics that will enable creation of this critical\r\nmedical device and accomplish three overarching goals: (1) design and develop the miniaturized\r\ncomponents, interconnects, firmware and software necessary to implement the hand-held AED\r\nSmartphone case in Phase Two by evaluating high voltage power supply and switching\r\nelectronics and completing a power converter and switching design capable of generating the\r\nrequired energy from an on-board lithium-ion battery and supporting a bi-phasic waveform; (2)\r\ndevelop the smartphone software and firmware necessary to implement the device itself, guide\r\na user through the emergency protocol, and send GPS information to EMS to allow them to\r\nlocate proximal first responders; (3) integrate the hardware and software into a prototype that\r\ndemonstrates a path to a form factor function unit in Phase 2. Research and designs of\r\ninterconnects and encapsulation methods developed as part of this effort will offer insight into\r\nthe miniaturization of myriad electronics both within and outside the medical domains.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
