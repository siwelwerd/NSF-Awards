 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop a transdisciplinary research agenda to address large-scale problems such as nutrient runoff, erosion, flooding, heat island effects, and urban sprawl at the urban/rural interface. The approach is a workshop on Redesigning the Urban-Rural Interface (RURI) along the Mississippi River Watershed (MRW). The meeting will foster collaborations among researchers, experts, and community members to advance the science needed to address current infrastructure challenges. Over two days, participants will explore the multi-state and multi-system impacts of climate variability, infrastructure design, and population dynamics within the watershed's network of cities. \r\n\r\nThe agenda is aligned with research focused on Sustainable Urban Systems (SUS). The SUS-RURI workshop will catalyze new knowledge of social-ecological-technological interdependence in urban systems using the synergistic methodology of design thinking to engage diverse participants. Framed by three ecological/climatic scales, panels and interactive sessions will encourage the development of transdisciplinary approaches to model, simulate, and assess land-use, sustainability, and resilience throughout the watershed. Participant interactions will generate knowledge to apply within the MRW as well as in other cities and their satellite communities and rural neighbors. This workshop will be an initial meeting to support development of a research network that will bring architecture, arts, data science, ecology, engineering, and socio-ecological systems professionals into a dialogue with a variety of community stakeholders and industry professionals. This conference enables broad participation by researchers in this diverse and interdisciplinary ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Future SUS-RURI research discussed by workshop participants is likely to generate new knowledge of social, technical, and infrastructural interdependence in the urban systems within the region. To guide workshop interactions, we used a collaborative synergistic methodology of design thinking to engage diverse participants and to create strong ties across disciplines.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Based on a 2018 United Nations report, close to half of urban dwellers will reside in settlements of fewer than 500,000 people by 2050. This workshop responded to an increasing need to develop a research agenda specific to these mid-sized metropolitan areas, with attention also given to their interrelationships in the larger landscape. As a case study to apply a convergence approach at a relatively large regional scale, the SUS-RURI workshop focused on the Mississippi River Watershed (MRW) as a network of cities together with their satellite communities and adjacent rural/agricultural areas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Coordinated SUS research in the MRW could contribute to ongoing efforts to address large-scale, multi-state, and multi-system problems such as nutrient runoff, erosion, flooding, heat island effects and sprawl. Within the MRW, Iowa (the workshop site) is a large contributor to the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico and has also had significant recent flood events. In Iowa and beyond, many cities along the MRW face challenges to maintain and update physical infrastructure left from a previous era of primarily industrial economies associated with the river, which historically allowed them to be major economic centers in the region. This workshop was an initial meeting to support development of a research coordination network that will bring architecture, design, community art, planning, urban ecology and urban socio-ecological systems professionals from within the MRW into a dialogue to inform future research and engagement with a variety of relevant stakeholders.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Workshop interactions were aimed at developing research questions and systems-level approaches to land-use practices, sustainability, and resilience along the watershed. The research questions discussed at the workshop (summarized in the proceedings) have the potential to lead to advances in data-driven urban systems science. Interactions among researchers, planners, sustainability experts, and diverse groups of students generated ideas critical to formulate research approaches to challenges and opportunities in urban core areas as well as among their satellite communities and rural neighbors. The program was led by faculty members in architecture and urban ecology, together with Organizing Committee (OC) members from community arts, rural sociology, urban ecology, and atmospheric sciences. The OC also included community and industry partners, as well as other scientists, artists, designers, and planners from institutions along the MRW.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The researchers, industry and community partners who participated came from communities and institutions spanning the MRW (e.g., from MN, IA, WI, MO, IL, TN, AR, MS, NE, KS, LA). The organization of the SUS-RURI workshop also engaged a diverse group of graduate student trainees through a poster session and faculty members at the forefront of a new thrust in urban systems science, laying groundwork for innovative approaches to STEM graduate education and supporting broad adoption of this approach across other disciplines and institutions. Overall the workshop attracted 82 participants, with a majority from Iowa, but also from Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Wisconsin. The workshop facilitated discussion about future research and practices that could enhance policies and actions, and lead to more resilient and sustainable urban environments across scales from individuals/households to whole-city landscapes. Open-access workshop proceedings will be published through the Iowa State University Digital Press in 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
