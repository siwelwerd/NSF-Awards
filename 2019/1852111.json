 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program in Chemical Engineering at the University of Florida (UF), Department of Chemical Engineering (ChE), will host a diverse cohort of undergraduate students who will be exposed to state-of-the-art Chemical Engineering research in the broad areas of: Catalysis and Reaction Engineering, Nanomanufacturing and Nanoscale Engineering, Complex Flows and Interfacial Phenomena, and Biomedical Applications. Visits to local technology incubators and interactions with local entrepreneurs will provide participants with examples of translation of laboratory technologies. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this 10 week summer REU program are to provide meaningful research experiences to undergraduates interested in chemical engineering research, provide formal and informal education on how to conduct research, and motivate students to pursue advanced studies in chemical engineering. Participants will conduct research in a broad range of areas representative of current Chemical Engineering research, including catalysis and reaction engineering, nanomanufacturing and nanoscale engineering, complex flows and interfacial phenomena, and biomedical applications of chemical engineering. Participants will be mentored by a group of sixteen faculty with a distinguished track record of mentoring undergraduates. Weekly seminars will introduce participants to many of the skills needed to be successful in research. These seminars will be led by UF ChE faculty, promoting interactions with potential role models. Participants will also benefit from visits to technology incubators and cultural sites close to Gainesville, FL.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Research projects spanned the breadth of chemical engineering research, including catalysis and reaction engineering, nanomanufacturing, complex flows and interfacial phenomena, and bioengineering. The site had a full program of seminars given by faculty mentors on topics including laboratory safety, research best practices and the scientific method, understanding scientific literature, data collection and record keeping, ethical considerations in research, effective oral presentations, diversity, equity, and inclusion in research, writing research papers, innovation and entrepreneurship, and pursuing graduate studies. Students also attended seminars by University of Florida Chemical Engineering PhD alumni, who spoke of their experiences as PhD students and careers since completing their PhD. Students benefitted from social activities to promote community and wellbeing. Students practiced presentation skills and shared their experiences with the cohort and broader audiences. The goal of recruiting a diverse pool of applicants was achieved through social media posts, email campaigns, and flyers distributed at conferences and by direct communication with other chemical engineering programs. Broader Impacts: The project&rsquo;s goals of providing meaningful research experiences to undergraduates, especially women and URM students, and motivating them to pursue advanced degrees were achieved. Of the 51 REU students 32 (63%) were women, 19 (37%) were under-represented minorities (URM, 14 Hispanic, 5 Black). Furthermore, of the 37 participants who had finished their undergraduate degrees at the time of this report, 26 (51%) were pursuing a PhD in Chemical Engineering and related disciplines.
