 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the structure of Sulfolobus spindle-shaped virus 1 (SSV1), a virus from volcanic hot springs.  The uniquely-shaped SSV1 thrives in acidic hot springs at above 175 &#730;F (80 &#730;C). Determining a high-resolution SSV1 structure will contribute to understanding how proteins interact at high temperatures. Discovering the genetic determinants of the SSV1 structure will provide insight into the stability not only SSV1, but all proteins. The research will also provide insight into virus evolution, and how life could have survived the extreme conditions present on early earth and/or on extra-terrestrial planets. The project will also provide research experiences to approximately 65 undergraduates working on SSV1 mutants.  The project will communicate science to the public in collaboration with the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry. \r\n\r\nThis research will address three open questions regarding the structure of SSV1: How does the virus form its unique spindle-shaped structure? What is the structure of the SSV1 tail that binds to the host cell? What are the critical amino acids in the capsid proteins? To answer these questions, this research will use a combination of cutting-edge cryo-electron microscopy techniques and genetic screens and selections. The research will evaluate two competing models for the SSV1 structure and could provide a new structural paradigm for virus structure. This research will provide a strong foundation for community outreach to educate and excite the public, and inspire the next generation of researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
