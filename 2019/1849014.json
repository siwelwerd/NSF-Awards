 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award addresses a long-standing problem of systematic discrepancies between modeled and observed plasma densities in the ionized portion of the upper atmospheric layer near 110 km in altitude (ionospheric E region). It is hypothesized that a key reason for these discrepancies is low-resolution model parameters related to ionization reactions of O, O2, and N2 with solar photons (photoionization). Insufficient resolution employed by the current models means that narrow \"windows\" of photoionization are not being properly accounted for. This work will improve the understanding of these windows of ionization for the three most important species in the E region (O, O2, and N2) and the effects on E-region ionization rates and densities. New parameters describing ionization reactions (ionization cross sections) will be calculated for all three species using modern quantum-mechanical methods. These parameters are important since they determine the probability that an ionization process will occur. The new cross sections will be provided to the atomic and molecular physics community. This will be also important to astrophysics and planetary sciences, which will improve synergies between different fields. In addition, the project will expand student opportunities to engage in research by offering research projects to students at one of the partner institutions with a diverse student population. \r\n\r\nThe work supported by this award will (1) calculate new cross sections for all three major species using modern quantum-mechanical methods for both photo- and photoelectron-impact ionization, (2) develop further the atmospheric photoionization code and the Atmospheric Ultraviolet Radiance Integrated Code (AURIC) to properly incorporate the improved ionization rates, photoelectron fluxes, and electron densities, (3) validate the new model outputs by comparing with E-region photoelectron fluxes measured by the low-Earth-orbit satellites and E-region electron densities measured by the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) satellites and the Arecibo incoherent scatter radar, and (4) provide the developed models to the community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These three papers are briefly summarized below.</p>\r\n<p>As reported in Meier et al. (2023), the ionospheric O<sup>+</sup> number density can be measured remotely during the day by observing its optically thick 83.4 nm radiance. Some ambiguity is present in the process of retrieving the density due to uncertainties in the initial excitation rate. This can be removed by observing a companion optically thin emission at 61.7 nm originating from a different O<sup>+</sup> state, providing that the ratio of the initial excitation rates is known. Analyses of ICON extreme ultraviolet data using an 83.4/61.7 emission ratio of order 10 result in O<sup>+</sup> densities lower by &sim;2 than other measurements. Key to relating the two emissions is accurate knowledge of the partial photoionization cross sections and the spectroscopy of O<sup>+</sup>. Up to now, no independent evaluation of the ratio of the 83.4/61.7 emission ratio exists. The recent availability of state-of-the-art calculations of O partial photoionization cross sections into a variety of O<sup>+</sup> states presents an opportunity to evaluate the ratio of the two O<sup>+</sup> state ionization rates. We calculate excitation of these parent states of the emissions including both direct and cascade excitation from higher lying O<sup>+</sup> energy states. The resulting theoretical prediction gives ratios that range from 13.5 to 12 from solar minimum to maximum, larger than the value of 10 used by the ICON 83.4 and 61.7 nm algorithm. The higher theoretical values for the ratio reconcile the &sim;2 discrepancy between simultaneous ICON and other electron density measurements.<br /><br />Calculations using the Atmospheric Ultraviolet Radiance Integrated Code (AURIC; Strickland et al., 1999) of varying flavors (i.e., different sets of photoionization and photoabsorption cross sections and solar EUV spectrum) were used to calculate the ion composition and electron density in the E-region. In Sakib et al. (2023), we compare measured electron densities with the output of AURIC using two different inputs: high resolution cross sections and solar spectral irradiance; and low-resolution cross sections. The main focus of this study is to take the first step and compare the real time electron density profiles (EDPs) with the output of a simplified model of the E-region using new calculations of high-resolution cross sections and solar spectral irradiance. It is evident that modeled E-region electron densities are significantly increased with the high-resolution cross sections and are likely to account for the mismatch between earlier models and the data. Incorporating high-resolution cross section calculations in the AURIC model clearly increases the photoionization rate and therefore the electron density in the E-region, improving agreement with observations by radars, satellites, and empirical model calculations. However, the altitude profiles of the high-resolution model EDPs do not generally agree with the data in terms of peak density. Future investigation of this work should address the inclusion of molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) high-resolution calculation of photoabsorption and photoionization cross sections in the model that may improve the agreement between observed and modeled E-region EDP shapes. Nevertheless, inter comparison between AURIC and other ionosphere models could well identify differences in physics, such as dynamics that could account for the mismatch with the data. Overall, considering all the uncertainties involved in calculation and data analysis discussed above, during a solar quiet day the simulated high-resolution version of AURIC and measured electron density vertical profiles are more aligned than the low-resolution AURIC runs.<br /><br />Most ionospheric models cannot sufficiently reproduce the observed electron density profiles in the E&#8208;region ionosphere and often attempt to mitigate the issue via unrealistic ad hoc modifications of the solar radiation flux. In Soto et al. (2024), we address the low&#8208;resolution cross sections and solar spectral irradiances used as model inputs that are largely responsible for the discrepancy between models and observations. Low spectral resolution cross sections fail to accurately preserve structural features which allow solar photons to reach lower altitudes. We provide new high&#8208;resolution atomic oxygen (O) and molecular nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) cross sections and solar spectral irradiances which preserve important structural features that allow photons to leak through and increase the photoionization rate and photoelectron flux. Model results show increased O<sup>+</sup> and total ion production rates of over 125% while a small decrease in the N<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> production rate over calculations with historical data. Model outputs also indicate that O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> plays an important role in the total ion production rate, particularly at &sim;120 km. These findings demonstrate that it is crucial to update ionosphere models with high&#8208;resolution photoionization and photoabsorption cross sections and high&#8208;resolution spectral irradiances.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/28/2025<br>\nModified by: Joseph&nbsp;S&nbsp;Evans</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1849014/1849014_10611598_1738013634043_total_vpr_final_v3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1849014/1849014_10611598_1738013634043_total_vpr_final_v3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 20 from Soto et al.
