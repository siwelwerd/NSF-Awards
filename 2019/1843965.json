 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project involves a low-cost, convenient, anonymous floor occupancy analysis. This will be achieved by developing a powerless, flexible subfloor sensor mat that can integrate with regular flooring products. If implemented in buildings, the sensor mat will help raise space utilization, improve occupant productivity and satisfaction, and inform dynamic layout planning for organizational agility. This sensor mat will address the needs from different parties in the small building ecosystem, including flooring manufacturers, building system integrators, work space system providers, architects and interior designers, and cooperations and businesses in commercial buildings. Additionally, this thin film with high electrical output, if successfully achieved in this project, will find great commercialization potential in other applications, such as self-powered, wireless adhesive wearable electronics, and implantable medical devices. This proposal also has an environmental impact in that it reduces carbon footprint, promotes use of green natural materials and generation of renewable energy.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project has the intellectual merits of addressing two key questions that could determine the technical and commercial feasibility of the occupancy sensor mat.  First, how to create a sufficiently thin and flexible sensor mat that has no impact on flooring installment and walking performance. Second, how to raise the electrical output and energy generated from the sensor mat to the level that is high enough to meet the requirements of signal resolution and wireless transmission? Specific research tasks and methods include: natural cellulosic materials chemical functionalization for electric property engineering towards high power output; sensor mat design to effectively convert footsteps to electricity within a confined mat thickness; integration of wireless transmission units tailored for the sensor mat towards a self-powered sensor with wireless connectivity. The final goal is to develop a powerless sensor from which the electrical output and the energy generation will be sufficient to sustain itself and to provide discernible data.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and their spin-off company EWPanel are taking sustainable energy to a new level...by making sustainable energy harvesters out of sustainable materials.  The team works with cellulosic materials?wood pulp, recycled paper, cotton, and other plant material--which can be modified to have certain electronic properties.  They take these materials and make what is called a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) which means that these materials produce static charges--like when you rub a balloon on hair--to convert movement into usable electricity.  Since cellulosic materials come from nature, they are readily recyclable or biodegradable which makes them much more ecofriendly than most TENG materials.\n\nKey features of TENGs are their ability to be flexible, durable, and relatively inexpensive compared to more traditional energy harvesters.  These make TENGs ideal for wearable technologies, self-powered devices, and even advanced medical devices like self-sufficient pacemakers.  One application that has gained a lot of momentum is self-powered, wireless sensors. These sensors can be used to track equipment, see how people move around a building, or monitor the health of mechanical systems in manufacturing--all without the need of batteries or wired power.  These sensors are called IoT (Internet of Things) sensors because they can be connected to a network to make businesses, commercial buildings, and houses work more efficiently and safely.  Since cellulosic TENGs are a relatively new technology, the research team worked with the National Science Foundation to bring them closer to market.\n\nThe researchers were looking to make a smart floor with these TENGs that would be powered solely by footsteps.  Each footstep would power a sensor which would then send occupancy data to a network to measure how people moved throughout a space.  This is helpful for businesses and smart buildings, because that data can give real-time and historical trends for what spaces are busy and when they're busy.  These data can then be used to automatically adjust heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and lighting in the building, or be used to optimize floor planning or improve displays in retail stores.  In order to use cellulosic TENGs in this application, the researchers needed to make some improvements to the technology.\n\nThe first was to get cellulosic materials that have the correct electronic properties.  One way to do this is to take natural cellulosic materials and do some chemistry to them to get what's called a cellulosic derivative.  This was the original plan but closures due to COVID-19 pressed to the team for time.  They instead used commercially available papers that already had chemistry done to them and contained cellulosic derivatives.  They tested weighing paper, printer paper, crafting paper, and tissue paper against nitrocellulose paper.  Nitrocellulose is good at holding negative charges (like a balloon) whereas the other papers were good at holding positive charge (like hair).  Weighing paper turned out to have the best results, showing a higher power output than the other three.  Thus, the team chose weighing paper and nitrocellulose as the two functional materials for their TENGs.\n\nFor flooring, the TENGs had to be thin.  To increase power output without compromising thickness, the team was able to increase the surface roughness of the weighing paper (nitrocellulose already had a rough surface).  This surface roughening improved the weighing paper's ability to hold positive charge which improved the TENG's performance.  The team was able to provide exceptional power output within thicknesses similar to most flooring underlayment, meaning that their sensors could be embedded under normal flooring materials without changing flooring aesthetics.  In fact, the team tested these sensors under multiple flooring materials (e.g. carpet, wood flooring) and saw negligible differences in their output.\n\nLastly, to make these sensors easy to install the team also developed a wireless transmission system that is powered by only by these TENGs.   With results mentioned above, the team was able to achieve a 1:1 footstep-to-signal ratio, meaning that a single footstep produced enough energy to power a wireless transmitter.  This ratio also means that the sensors have good sensitivity and give more accurate data.  This also lays the groundwork for other wireless, self-powered sensors such as wander management trackers for dementia and Alzheimer's patients, remote health monitors, or self-sufficient activewear.  This was the first demonstration of a cellulosic TENG powering a wireless transmitter with such sensitivity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/18/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lazarus N German"
