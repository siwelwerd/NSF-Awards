 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines to diversify the STEM workforce.  Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nFor the United States to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The Harris County Community College Alliance (HCCCA), consisting of two public, associate-degree granting, Hispanic Serving two-year institutions (San Jacinto College and Houston Community College), was formed in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the state of Texas.  HCCCA will build on research-based models which have proven successful in increasing the number of underrepresented community college students who transfer to four-year institutions in a STEM discipline.  This focus supports the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to \"cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.\"  In support of the focus, the Alliance will engage students in STEM exposure, first-year peer mentoring, faculty mentoring, competitive summer research and internship opportunities, an annual research symposium, STEM seminar series, and dedicated social media sites to help facilitate the social cohesion critical for community college students to form their academic identify.  In support of the transfer goal, the alliance will use mapping, or guided pathways, with clearly identified educational and career goals, to provide easier transitions to four-year institutions.  In addition, a pipeline will be created that uses alumni LSAMP students already at the transfer institution to help receive the new transfer students and establish a new Community of Scholars at the university.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

From 06/01/2019 to 05/31/2023 HCCCA investigated the use of effective activities and interventions to provide community college students with the guidance and structure to reach their target goals of baccalaureate degrees. Goals for this program focused on strengthening three critical areas of transition common to community colleges: recruitment, retention, and transfer. This was accomplished by creating three student communities.</p>\n<p><strong>Community of Scholars:</strong> This community is a network designed to connect students within the college environment. Providing dedicated spaces as a \"home away from home\", LSAMP Scholars have a place to gather during the school day that gives them a sense of belonging in a collegiate community. Here they meet with faculty and peer mentors, attend tutoring, participate in STEM activities, and form academic relationships by engaging with other like-minded STEM students. This community also focuses on helping students transfer successfully. LSAMP B2B scholars map their coursework through guided pathways for their specific degree programs at their choice of transfer institutions. This helps them to avoid taking unnecessary or ineligible courses and ensures a smoother transition to bachelor's degree programs. While virtual and in-person university tours, webinars between community colleges and universities, and university exhibits at community college campuses are key components of a transfer pipeline, the most influential part is the alumni students' personal interactions with community college students. At both ends of the pipeline, they mentor scholars on the transfer process and serve as guides to help the transfer students navigate their new university path.</p>\n<p><strong>Community of Experience: </strong>This community immerses students in experiential learning and STEM outreach activities, broadening their exposure to STEM topics and careers. Student activities include STEM speakers and seminars, STEM workshops, Industry/Professional outreach events, Robotics Programs, and Community-hosted STEM outreach events. These experiences provide students opportunities to learn new concepts, explore possible careers, and pay it forward to the next generation. Providing real-life experiences creates social connections while supporting, encouraging, and enhancing the academic journey.</p>\n<p><strong>Community of Research: </strong>This community elevates community college students into the STEM researcher role and instills motivation and intellectual curiosity. To accomplish this, the first step is educating students about internships and their benefits. The alliance then forms collaborations with area universities and business and industry partners to provide students with research experiences and internship positions. In the last step students actively pursue these opportunities, as well as others across the country. These efforts result in students being placed at internships locally, within the United States, and internationally. These research experiences lead to networking opportunities that turn into meaningful mentoring relationships. Students identify this best practice as a key factor in contributing to their transfer success.</p>\n<p>The ultimate success factor of the <strong>Louis Stokes B2B Alliance: Harris County Community College Alliance </strong>comes from creating intentional STEM connections within a pipeline. The pipeline connects community college students with like-minded peers and mentors, provides a collegiate home away from home, offers unique STEM experiences for exploration, and opens doors to research and internships. The pipeline is not just for the first-year student but continues to and through their transfer to the university. It allows students to remain connected and engaged throughout the journey to reach their goal of a STEM baccalaureate degree.</p>\n<p>Using this pipeline, HCCCA met an ambitious goal of a 10% increase per year in the number of alliance students transferring into STEM programs at four-year institutions.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/23/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
