 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF INCLUDES Conference on Finding Re-Entry Pathways for Women in STEM was created in response to the NSF INCLUDES program's Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Supporting the Re-Entry of Women and Women Veterans in the STEM Workforce through NSF INCLUDES (NSF 19-038). The number of jobs in our country requiring substantial STEM expertise has grown nearly 34 percent over the past decade and employers say they are having trouble filling jobs in occupations that depend on skilled technical workers.  Women and women veterans are a pool of talented individuals who can fill STEM jobs nationwide. The project team is developing, organizing, conducting and evaluating a conference supporting the re-entry of women and women veterans in STEM emerging technology fields, such as cybersecurity, data science, mobile development and cloud computing.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the two-day conference is to explore and discuss challenges encountered by returning women with the objective of better understanding their situations and identifying solutions to their problems in accessing emerging technology education and employment.  In addition to the many women students who participate in the conference, there are also presenters and invited participants from industry, NSF INCLUDES Alliances, social science and policy fields, and from support organizations, such as university veteran's affairs and academic services offices at universities. \r\n\r\nAn external evaluator, and a conference advisory board, are assessing the outcomes and impacts of this project. Dissemination includes presenting findings at national conferences and publishing in journals, as well as conducting a Webinar on best practices for returning women in emerging technology fields.  Resource materials are published on a project website.  Results from the meeting enhance the understanding of processes for re-entry, and the related barriers and opportunities women face entering and re-entering the STEM workforce, especially in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.  \n\n\nThe RESET (Re-Enter STEM through Emerging Technology) project in collaboration with Syracuse University, an NSF INCLUDES Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) Conference: Supporting the Re-Entry of Women and Women Veterans in the STEM Workforce, met its three main goals, and those who attended the conference were very satisfied with (1) the event structure itself, (2) the ways in which it empowered them to think more proactively about barriers for minoritized women (re-)entering STEM and emerging technology (EmTech) fields and how to mitigate them, and (3) the key learnings that they took from the conference. Attendees reported that the conference, the presenters, the networks established, and the knowledge they gained from the sessions will benefit them as they continue to pursue education and careers in computing and technology fields moving forward.  \n\n\nThe 2021 NSF RESET Conference, a three-day national virtual conference, was held on March 4-6, 2021.It consisted of 38 sessions and 62 women speakers who presented during the conference.

Due to the demands for millions of EmTech jobs across the industry sectors, it is important to understand the barriers and challenges faced by returning women to (re-)enter EmTech fields. Hence, the NSF INCLUDES DCL RESET Conference concluded with the following outcomes impacting informal and formal STEM/computing education research:  \n \n\n\nGenerated new knowledge about STEM minoritized women successful in re-entering STEM educational and workforce trajectories, specifically in EmTech fields with and without a career break. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to sharper light some of the (existing and new) issues and unique challenges that women (re-)entering education and workforce face. Hence, the new knowledge factors in the intersectionality of women to provide recommendations that will strengthen the pipeline, for returning women, from career break to EmTech education and workforce.\nImplemented a collective impact approach to broaden participation and improve diversity in STEM by building capacity with minoritized adult women in EmTech fields such as AI/ML, cloud computing, data science, cybersecurity, and mobile app development.   \nFollowed a virtual asset-based community development approach to generate and share resources to equip minoritized women for STEM/EmTech education and future-ready workforce.  \nPublished research articles that are in the intersection of EmTech and computing education. A special issue journal with ACM Transactions on Computing Education (TOCE) included a collection of papers presenting empirical and theory-based research that aim to expand the current knowledge base on women\u2019s experiences, their strategies as they navigate computing career pathways, and their challenges in working in computing fields.  \nIdentified the barriers for returning women to enter EmTech education and workforce. Survey respondents and focus group participants reported similarly on key barriers, both from their own lived experiences and from what they learned in conference sessions.  \nInformed best practices to create effective re-entry strategies in EmTech for returning women. Meaningful recommendations were provided by RESET Conference attendees in both the survey and focus groups to inform the field of ways to better support re-entry for EmTech women into both academia and industry settings.  \nConnected with scholars, policy makers and leaders to make change in EmTech. Throughout the survey and focus group data, participants noted the value of the connections they made with other attendees and presenters, the importance of networking, and the ways in which an intentional network of support is meaningful as they further their pursuits in the field.  \n\n\nWhile the findings of this study are preliminary in nature, they provide some insight into the potential to engage more minoritized adult women in STEM education and workforce; and thus, positively influence the number of students and professionals of color who succeed in skilling, upskilling and reskilling in STEM education, workforce and beyond. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elodie V Billionniere"
