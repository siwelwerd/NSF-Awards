 "awd_abstract_narration": "When plants are wounded by insect feeding or infected by microbial pathogens, they respond by producing hormones that function as signals to allow the plant to mount a defense.  Often the defense involves turning on, or activating, beneficial genes that help the plant survive the damage and then turning off, or repressing, those genes once the danger wanes.  This research seeks to understand the molecular details of how these genes transition from \"off\" to \"on\".  Knowledge of the detailed mechanism could be broadly important for agriculture by providing a foundation for genetic manipulation and development of crop plants optimized for defense and growth. This project will offer research training opportunities to guest international graduate students and undergraduates from from a local community college, thereby contributing to the preparation of the future scientific workforce. In addition, through participation in hands-on research experiences, high school teachers will improve their ability to communicate the scientific process and engage their students in meaningful science learning.   \r\n\r\nThis research is focused on the plant defense hormone jasmonate.  In healthy plants, jasmonate-responsive genes are bound by a multi-protein complex composed of a repressor called JAZ, a transcriptional activator called MYC, and a group of other proteins.  In the absence of jasmonate, the JAZ repressor inhibits the MYC activator, and the genes are transcriptionally silent, or off.  In response to damage from herbivorous insects and many microbial pathogens, jasmonate is produced and turns on these genes by inducing the proteasomal degradation of the JAZ repressor, thereby relieving inhibition of MYC, which turns on the genes by activating transcription.  The molecular details and the roles played by the many proteins that participate in this transition from repressed to active state are largely unknown.  This project seeks to discover how the large multi-protein complexes involved in jasmonate signaling are assembled and regulated.  Approaches will include a combination of X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, biochemical, biophysical, and in planta analyses, and in cell signaling reconstitution. Because many signaling cascades result in transitions from repressed to active gene expression, the results could serve as a paradigm for discovering, and eventually manipulating, the responsible regulatory protein complexes. \r\n\r\nThis award was co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms and the Molecular Biophysics Programs in the Division of Molecular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
