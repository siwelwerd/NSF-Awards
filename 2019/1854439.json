 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biomolecular building blocks can exhibit either right- or left-handed symmetries; such building blocks are known as enantiomers.  All biomolecules found in living organisms have only one \"handedness', that is, the molecules exist only in one enantiomeric form. Moreover, different enantiomers of the same molecule can interact with living organisms in completely different ways, sometimes beneficially and sometimes with catastrophic effects.  As the wrong handedness can cause harm, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals must be synthesized in enantiopure forms. This synthesis may be accomplished by purification after the drug has been synthesized, but that approach is often difficult and cumbersome.  It is preferable to develop processes in which only one enantiomer of the drug is made. Enantiopure syntheses can be accomplished by using solid-phase catalysts with surfaces that are specifically modified to preferentially produce molecules with only one handedness. There have been a number of trial-and-error efforts to discover such heterogeneous catalysts, but success has so far been limited. Drs. Tysoe (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) and Zaera (University of California-Riverside) have considerable experience in studying the surface chemistry of catalytic systems under ideal conditions.  Their research project focuses on understanding the molecular interactions that control enantio-selectivity in more complex and realistic systems for the advanced manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. Drs. Tysoe and Zaera are strongly committed to educating women and minorities, in particular, Hispanic students both in the laboratory and through formal courses.  They participate in outreach programs at Milwaukee and Riverside, and are incorporating the research associated with this project into those activities.      \r\n\r\nWith funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Drs. Tysoe and Zaera are studying the surface chemistry of model palladium(111) and platinum(111) chiral catalysts modified by a cinchonidine analog, 1-(1-naphthyl) ethylamine (NEA), using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), infrared absorption spectroscopy, reactivity measurements, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This research provides a molecular-level understanding of the diastereomeric interactions between a number of prochiral reactants and NEA, and the forces that control them. They are investigating whether the detailed molecular understanding of the chiral surface chemistry from single-crystal studies in ultrahigh vacuum is relevant to the reaction pathways occurring under realistic conditions, that is, under atmospheric pressures and in the presence of a liquid phase. The resulting understanding may provide insights into how to improve catalytic selectivity.  The research may facilitate the targeted design of supported heterogeneous enantioselective catalysts. Such an ability is expected to have a significant economic impact in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Drs. Tysoe and Zaera focus on educating women and minorities through their research and outreach programs as part of the broader impacts of the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has focused on developing a better understanding of the way chiral modifiers adsorb and bestow enantioselectivity to hydrogenation heterogeneous catalysts.  Most organic compounds contain carbon atoms, and in molecules where the four groups bonded to any of those carbons are all different there are two identical but non-superimposable (mirror-image enantiomers) versions of these so-called chiral compound.  These display identical chemistry except when they interact with other chiral compound.  The relevance of such behavior is that the chemistry of life, for reasons not yet fully understood, has developed to involve only one chirality.  Consequently, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals need to match the desirable chirality, that is, they need to be enantiopure, to perform well.  A large fraction of the pharmaceuticals sold in today's market are chiral.\n\nMost chiral compounds are made using homogeneous catalysts, but for many reasons, including an increased simplicity in the design of industrial processes, it would be desirable to develop heterogeneous (solid) catalysts for this purpose.  One way to impart chirality to solids is to add so-called chiral modifiers to the reaction mixture, compounds that bestow enantioselectivity to their surface.  Our contribution to this area has been to study of adsorption in situ from liquid solutions of promising chiral modifiers using infrared absorption spectroscopy.  Past studies using model surfaces, namely, Pt polished disks, are being extended to more realistic (i.e., supported) catalysts.  Other approaches to bestowing chirality to solid catalysts, including direct derivatization of high-surface-area oxides with chiral molecules, are being explored as well.  It is early days still, but we believe that we have added significantly to the molecular picture of how these modifiers adsorb and behave on the surface of the catalyst.  Specifically, we have determined that, under realistic catalytic conditions, the adsorption of 1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine (1-NEA), a prototypical chiral modifier, takes place via the nitrogen atom in its amine group.  This result puts into question the existing models used to explain the chiral catalysis, and offer a set of guiding principle for the search of the modifiers.  In more general terms, our work fits nicely within the effort by the surface-science and catalysis communities to try to understand the microscopic details of heterogeneous catalysis.  In addition, our work has required the development of new ways to investigate mechanistic details of surface reactions that can be extended to other areas, including the semiconductor industry, to tribological problems, and to solid interfaces of biological interest. \n\nFrom the point of view of the development of human resources, our project has afforded the training of several undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and visiting scholars on the use of surface-sensitive spectroscopies such as reflection-absorption (RAIRS) and attenuated-total-reflection (ATR-IR) infrared absorption spectroscopies, and the employment of catalytic reactors for kinetic catalyst characterization.
