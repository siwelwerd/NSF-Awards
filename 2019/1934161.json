 "awd_abstract_narration": "Working with children and their teachers in grades 3-5, this 3-year project investigates the idea that expressing and exploring mathematics through an appropriate programming language may make it easier for children to engage fully and enjoy and learn that mathematics. Children need their natural language to talk about the contexts in which mathematics gets used - far more than just word problems - and also their reasoning when solving problems. Over the years, they learn a second language, that is, the mathematical symbols needed for expressing arithmetic and algebraic statements. Both are needed, but neither is optimal for expressing a process - showing the way a calculation is performed (think of explaining how to multiply 37 x 43 or add 3/4 + 1/2), or encoding the method for solving a word problem in a way that can be repeated with different starting values. For that, a third language is needed. In an earlier exploratory work conducted with second grade students, the research team investigated the use of a child-friendly but very rich programming language (Snap!) as the third language. When children are provided with an opportunity to explain a process to a machine - that is, by describing the process as a small program, they develop clearer and more concise ways to explain the process in their natural language. Expressing the process as a small program helps children not only experiment and generalize but gives them a \"runnable\" notation for their thinking. Unlike writing on paper, which just sits there, correct or incorrect, a runnable piece of code lets children get immediate feedback on their work and helps their mathematical learning long before career or college. Building the program, articulating the methods, and generalizing are all key elements of computational thinking (CT), which is increasingly a national, state, and school priority, because it is now so necessary both for careers and for modern college study. This project extends the investigation to grades 3-5, seeking new opportunities in the more advanced mathematics of those grades and seeking clearer data on the effects on both mathematical learning and CT.  This project is funded by the STEM + Computing (STEM+C) program that supports research and development to understand the integration of computing and computational thinking in STEM learning.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to understand how programming, integrated with elementary students' regular mathematics study, influences mathematical and computational thinking, and to determine whether, and under what conditions, it enhances thinking. This early-stage design and development study explores both the promise of materials that integrate programming into the mathematics curriculum to extend students' learning opportunities in the elementary math classroom, and the feasibility of the implementation of these materials. The project will (1) investigate a model that integrates programming into elementary mathematics and builds foundational CT ideas; (2) develop programming microworlds and other instructional resources (e.g., print materials and teacher guides) for grades 3-5 to support teachers and students; (3) pilot the materials in 48 classrooms, testing for feasibility and usability; (4) explore how the modules influence student learning and identify design features that help or interfere with learning; (5) describe challenges to broader use and identify potential solutions; and (6) provide greater opportunities for a wide range of students to learn in these domains. A design experiment methodology will be used to develop, test, and refine the microworlds and modules. Teacher interviews and classroom and student observation tools will be used to collect data, and a pilot study will be conducted using a mixed-methods approach that will compare the computational and mathematical thinking of students who experience the integrated modules with a comparison group in similar classrooms in the same school.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project developed and tested the use of programming microworlds within a blocks-based language, Snap<em>!</em>, that integrate programming into elementary mathematics as a language to help children express and explore mathematical ideas. Embedding programming into core mathematics instruction ensures that all children gain experience with programming, in developmentally appropriate ways, and it increases access to critical content by providing an engaging approach to learning mathematics that offers different affordances than pencil-and-paper activities.</p>\r\n<p>Programming gives students a language with which to express their thinking precisely and have that thinking enacted by the computer, making it easier for students to assess, refine, and extend their thinking. Expressing mathematical ideas as runnable code lets students experiment with mathematics and gather results from the experiments much as they would manipulate physical objects to explore their properties and behaviors. This approach takes advantage of how children learn: by doing, getting feedback, building experience, then naming and systematizing. This epistemological principle of <em>experience before formality</em> guided the approach to development in this project.</p>\r\n<p>Our use of microworlds within Snap<em>!</em> allows us to limit cognitive distraction and provide a low threshold for entry into programming for young children, as early as grade 2, while giving them an authentic programming experience in a powerful language. A microworld provides only the programming tools needed for a specific context; ours limit the programming blocks that children can see or access within Snap<em>!</em>, provide a customized mathematical stage (e.g., a number line, a coordinate grid, a rectangle building grid), and sets of highly mathematical puzzles, increasing in sophistication, for children to solve.</p>\r\n<p>The microworlds have a low threshold for entry for teachers as well. Teachers need not be expert in programming, or in Snap<em>!</em>, to use and enjoy these resources. Use in classrooms is intended to be a multi-day sequence of instruction, like a mini-module, that can be fully integrated with the core content being explored in the mathematics curriculum.</p>\r\n<p>Results from iterative testing indicate that children were highly engaged with this approach, quickly developing facility with Snap<em>!</em>, learning the programming skills targeted in each microworld, and engaging with the intended mathematics. The approach also supported robust child-to-child and child-to-teacher interaction, with teachers reporting that the microworlds allowed them windows into the mathematical thinking of their students that typical materials did not. Participating classroom teachers had minimal prior experience with programming, and their knowledge and confidence in using the microworlds, and programming in general, increased.</p>\r\n<p>The project has also had an impact on the evolution of Snap<em>!</em> itself. Our work with the Snap<em>!</em> developers has resulted in our microworld fork becoming an extension in Snap<em>!</em>, making development easier and more maintainable, and importantly, opening up microworld design to developers beyond our project. We continue to work closely with the Snap<em>!</em>&nbsp;team to integrate our work into new features in Snap<em>!</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Dissemination efforts for this project reflect a focus on engaging practitioners as well as research audiences. All published microworlds are freely available on our <em>Elementary Math at EDC</em> website, and have been accessed by teachers in the U.S. and internationally. Our video for the NSF STEM for All Video Showcase, <em>Math+C: Mathematics through programming in grades 2-5 </em>(Spencer et al., 2022), won a Presenters Choice award and a Public Choice award, and was recognized as one of the most discussed submissions. Our article for mathematics educators, <em>Using programming to express mathematical ideas </em>(Spencer et al., 2023) was named by NCTM as one of their top 5 most downloaded articles of 2023, and we have written three articles for research audiences (Goldenberg &amp; Carter, 2021; Goldenberg et al., 2021; Goldenberg et al., 2023). We have presented about this project over 20 times at national and international conferences such as CSTA, NCTM, Connected Learning, Constructionism, and Snap<em>!</em>Con, as well as many regional conferences.
