 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor William J. Evans at the University of California, Irvine, is supported by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division at NSF. This research addresses chemical reactions of rare-earth elements.  Rare-earth elements have been designated critical national resources due to their many technological applications. They are important in magnetism and quantum computing - technologies that have broad potential applications. The project also pursues applications including the development of the smallest, most efficient, magnets, called single-molecule magnets.  In addition, students are trained in the use and applications of strategic resources. A component of the project also involves an outreach program to middle and high schools to expose students to rare earths elements, their applications, and the value of scientific research.    \r\n\r\nThe chemistry of praseodymium(II), gadolinium(II), terbium(II), holmium(II), erbium(II), and lutetium(II), is being explored to evaluate the special chemical reactions that can arise from their unexpected 4fn5d1 electron configurations.  These electron configurations differ from traditional +2 oxidation states of the lanthanide metals (4fn+1 configurations) and could form the basis for new fundamental types of redox chemistry.  The chemistry of the new rare earth ion, yttrium(II) (4d1 configuration) is also being studied for comparison.  New series of complexes of these +2 ions are synthesized and their reactivity and magnetic and spectroscopic properties are investigated. As these compounds are photoactive diradicals, they present intriguing new options in synthesis, magnetism, and small molecule activation.  Among other applications, the development of quantum bits, or qubits, is being pursued.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThe goal of this research is to find new ways to utilize the unique properties of the rare-earth metals by synthesizing new compositions of matter and exploring their properties.  The rare-earth metals are defined as scandium, yttrium, and the lanthanide metals, which are lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium and lutetium.  These elements are not rare in the earth?s crust despite their name!  They are currently used to make powerful magnets and energy-efficient lighting, vehicles, and windmills, as well as effective catalysts, but there is still much to learn about their fundamental chemistry.\n\nThis project has focused on the exploration of new oxidation states of the rare-earth metals.  One fundamental characteristic of any metal is the extent to which it loses electrons to form ions with a positive charge, which is called the oxidation state. For example, when an elemental metal loses two electrons, it will have a +2 charge and will be said to be in the +2 oxidation state.  \n\nOxidation states are the basis of reduction and oxidation reactions (redox) which are of general importance in our lives.  Redox reactions are essential for biological processes like respiration and industrial processes like solar water splitting (to generate hydrogen cleanly for use as a fuel) and dinitrogen reduction to ammonia (for fertilizer to grow the food that feeds the world).  These reactions must be better developed to solve global problems involving increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  The rare-earth metals represent extremes among the elements in the periodic table and constitute an excellent set of metals for exploring the limits of redox reactions.    \n\nThis project is based on our discovery of new +2 oxidation states for seven rare-earth elements:  yttrium, praseodymium, gadolinium, terbium, holmium, erbium, and lutetium.  It was surprising to find these seven new oxidation states because chemists had previously believed they were inaccessible. \n\nIn addition, these new ions had an unusual electronic structure, i.e. the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus.  The new electronic configuration was a blend of that found in traditional rare-earth metal ions and in transition metal ions like titanium.  The results from this project forced us to change the way we think about the chemistry of the rare-earth metals and also raised interesting questions on a broader scale about reduction chemistry, oxidation states, and electron configurations from what had been previously known.  The results taught us that if we synthesized molecules with the proper geometry, a new electronic configuration was possible that allowed isolation of new oxidation states. \n\nThe new oxidation states present exciting opportunities for development in many areas of practical importance. One example afforded by these ions is the fact that the +2 ions of yttrium (Y) and lutetium (Lu) have properties that make them quantum bits, i.e. qubits, the unit of information storage for the very powerful quantum computers that are being developed.  These new computers could revolutionize science and technology, but they must have stable qubits to operate reliably.  The Y and Lu systems are demonstrating new ways to make reliable qubits.\n\nThe new oxidation states are also expanding the methods available to activate and transform dinitrogen, which is important since current methods for transform dinitrogen to ammonia consume large amounts of energy.\n\nA concomitant goal of this project is to train the next generation of scientists experienced in the chemistry of the rare-earth metals.  These metals are designated as critical national resources due to concerns about global supply because of their importance to energy, national security, defense, and the economy.  It is therefore essential to have experts trained in this area. \n\nIn summary, this project to synthesize new compounds is making contributions to the fundamental chemistry of a group of metals with a variety of practical applications while simultaneously training future leaders in critical areas of science and technology. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/20/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William J Evans"
