 "awd_abstract_narration": "I. The Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) has articulated full organizational commitment to broadening participation in coastal and estuarine science. CERF developed Rising TIDES (Toward an Inclusive, Diverse, and Enriched Society) as a comprehensive program for enhancing the diversity and inclusion of our scientific society and CERF conferences. The overall goals of this program are to promote opportunities for all underrepresented and underserved minorities while cultivating a culture that actively engages and leverages diversity throughout our organization. Rising TIDES intentionally affirms and promotes the value of diversity in all forms, including differences among individuals in racial and ethnic backgrounds, genders, sexual orientations, nationalities, and physical abilities.\r\n\r\nII. Broadening participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is widely recognized as critical to the science and engineering enterprise. There is still a wide gap in U.S. STEM educational attainment between URM individuals and whites and Asians, and coastal and estuarine science faces similar gaps in URM representation. In recognition of this gap and to incorporate\r\nfundamental change in the way the CERF community supports and addresses the individual needs of all members, CERF seeks funding to support diversity and inclusion efforts at its 2019 Biennial Conference in November 2019. Specifically, these efforts include: (1) enhance URM student professional development throughout a two-conference cycle, including cohort building, mentoring, and participation\r\nin a URM-focused workshop, scientific sessions, and other conference activities; (2) build the capacity of CERF to achieve DEI objectives through a workshop open to all attendees, and through additional learning opportunities throughout the conference; and (3) ensure broad engagement of the CERF community by infusing DEI throughout the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
