 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) seek to observe and understand gravitational waves. Gravitational waves (GWs) are oscillations in space and time that are generated whenever mass moves suddenly. They can carry information about cosmic catastrophes, such as the collisions of black holes and neutron stars. Since 2015, LIGO has observed six GW events, revealing entirely new information about these exotic objects, which are located tens or hundreds of millions of light years away. This award will enable LIGO to search for additional GW signals and to improve LIGO?s sensitivity so that it can observe even more distant cataclysms.\r\nLIGO is the world?s premier gravitational wave observatory. It is a key part of an emerging global network of similar detectors. These are now in operation or under development in Italy, Japan, and India. Concurrent measurements by LIGO and optical, radio, and X-ray observatories have inaugurated the era of multi-messenger astronomy, when synergistic detections of gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves reveal entirely new and exciting information about the cosmos. LIGO?s historic GW observations were recognized by the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics to LIGO pioneers Barry Barish, Kip Thorne, and Rainer Weiss.\r\nThis award will stimulate the development of a scientific and technically educated workforce, advance the multidisciplinary application of LIGO-related technology, and it will disseminate information about LIGO-related science and technology to the general public. This award will fund the operation of the existing LIGO apparatus, as well as the design, test, and operation of apparatus that will improve LIGO?s sensitivity. This, and related research activities, will create continued opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between LIGO staff members, post-docs, and students, and the approximately 1100 researchers and students at 108 universities world-wide that collaborate with LIGO.  \r\nTechnical part: Funding in the amount of up to $225,000,000 is provided for the continued operation of the LIGO observatories at Hanford Washington and Livingston, Louisiana, the associated science and engineering support programs at Caltech and MIT, and for carrying out education and public outreach programs that disseminate information about LIGO. Funding will be awarded through a new current cooperative agreement (PHY - 1764464) for the period from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2023.  The proposed effort includes:\r\n?\tMaintenance and operation of the LIGO sites and interferometers\r\n?\tCommissioning the interferometers to enhance their sensitivity to GWs \r\n?\tConducting astrophysical data analysis and detector characterization to discriminate GW signals from noise sources\r\n?\tCarrying out research and development to enhance detector sensitivity beyond the current design performance\r\n?\tCuration of LIGO data and its dissemination to the broader research community \r\n?\tProvision of software and computing resources to LIGO, and the development of new computing tools and methods that extend LIGO?s data analysis capabilities \r\n?\tContinuation of the vibrant observatory-based LIGO education and public outreach program\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n \r\n\n\nBeginning in 2015, LIGO opened an entirely new window on the Universe by directly detecting gravitational waves from a pair of colliding black holes located approximately 1.3 billion light years away. This detection not only verified a key prediction of Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, it convincingly demonstrated that gravitational-wave observations are a powerful new tool to study the most energetic astrophysical events in cosmos.\r\n\n\n \n \r\n\n\nDuring the period from 2019 through 2023, the LIGO Laboratory together with the LIGO Scientific Collaboration have greatly expanded our view of the Cosmos through the continued gravitational-wave observations carried out during the 'O3' and 'O4' observing runs with our partner the Virgo detector in Italy. Enabled by improvements to the Advanced LIGO interferometers located in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA, nearly 300 gravitational-wave events have been seen so far. Over the course of this award period, significant improvements to the Advanced LIGO interferometers have been made, dramatically enhancing the rate at which gravitational-wave events are detected from a few per year in the 'O1' observing run to one every three days on average in the 'O4' run.\r\n\n\n \n \r\n\n\nLIGO is designed to detect gravitational-waves in the 20 Hz - 5000 kHz frequency range where it is sensitive to compact astrophysical objects including neutron stars (with masses 1 - 2.5 times solar mass) and black holes (having 3 - 500 solar masses) that form in pairs and undergo orbital decay and cataclysmic collisions during their lifetimes. Key discoveries in the past five years include the first direct observations of mergers of neutron star - black hole systems, the first observation of the formation of an intermediate mass black hole born of the fusion of two lighter mass black holes and located approximately 7 billion light years from earth, and the confirmation that black holes can be formed in the 'forbidden' mass range between 60 and 130 solar masses where no known conventional stellar collapse mechanisms for forming black holes exist. (Figure 1)\r\n\n\n \n \r\n\n\nContinuous improvements to the Advanced LIGO interferometers has been crucial to enabling these observations. These interferometers are now capable of detecting gravitational-wave strains (changes in length per unit length) to better than 1 part in 10-22 in their most sensitive frequency bands. The introduction of frequency-dependent squeezing - a quantum sensing scheme using the generation and injection of quantum-engineered 'squeezed light states' into the interferometers - was one of the key improvements made during the award period, allowing us to improve Advanced LIGOs binary neutron star detection range by 100 million light years. (Figure 2)\r\n\n\n \n \r\n\n\nThe LIGO Laboratory's education and public outreach programs continued to educate and inform visitors about the science and engineering of LIGO. During FY2019-2023, the LIGO Hanford and Livingston Observatories hosted more than 60,000 people across all age groups, including K-12 STEM education programs, professional teacher development programs, and Science Saturdays for the general public.  A highlight of this period was the construction and dedication of the LIGO Exploration Center at the LIGO Hanford Observatory (Figure 3) funded by the State of Washington.
