 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies how massive stars are formed.  Massive stars have relatively short lives, quickly burning their hydrogen and helium into heavier elements, like carbon, oxygen and silicon.  The production of heavy elements in stars is an essential step in the formation of planets and the emergence of life.  While long-lived, low-mass stars like our Sun produce some light elements up to carbon, it is the luminous and short-lived massive stars that produce all the heavier elements.  Thus, the rate of cosmic heavy-element enrichment is determined by the abundances of low- and high-mass stars. \r\n\r\nStars form from the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of interstellar clouds.  Star formation is self-regulated, limited by the injection of energy by new stars.  Such feedback can terminate accretion and help to set the final stellar masses.  Measuring feedback impacts is one of the goals of this proposal.  At the end of stellar life, massive stars explode as supernovae and their freshly synthesized elements are mixed into interstellar clouds.  The relative abundance of low- and high-mass stars is determined by star formation.   \r\n\r\nStars are almost never born alone.  Most stars form in clusters and groups where gravity can lead to interactions among stars.  As stars move about inside a cloud, gas drag can lead to orbit decay.  Close encounters can trigger accretion from their circumstellar disks onto the stars to produce luminous flares. \r\n\r\nThe investigator has several goals.  They will analyze the Orion explosion and its impact on the environment. Then they will determine how common Orion-like protostellar explosions are and measure their feedback impacts. To achieve their goals, they will use radio astronomy methods to search for accretion-powered explosions from young stars and numerically model protostellar encounters to estimate their roles in setting stellar masses \r\n   \r\nScience is the driver of technology with drives future economic landscapes.  The investigator promotes public discourse on the foundational role of pure research for establishing new technologies.   This research will provide training in multi-wavelength astrophysics and the use of new observational tools, data-mining and numerical modeling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nStars and their planetary systems form from the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of dense clumps in interstellar molecular clouds.  During the last decades, observations have shown that collapsing clumps tend to fragment into dozens to thousands of denser cloud cores. Thus, most star forming regions produce dense, but short lived clusters of stars. In regions such as the dense molecular core behind the Orion Nebula, known as OMC1, the mean separation between stars is of order a few thousand Astronomical Units - the mean separation between the Earth and the Sun.\n\n\nMost forming stars produce bipolar jets and outflows as they accrete matter from their parent cores. The power of these outflows increases with stellar mass. Additionally, forming massive stars are luminous, produce powerful winds, intense ultraviolet radiation, and are short lived. Stars with masses tanging from 8 to about 100 Solar masses die within 40 million to 3 million years of birth in powerful supernova explosions.  Jets and outflows from forming stars, winds, radiation, and explosions of massive stars destroy the star forming environment. Such feedback of energy limits the fraction of a molecular cloud's mass which can be converted into stars. Observations show that most star-forming clouds are destroyed by the time 5 to 10 percent of a cloud's mass is converted into stars. The young stars inherit random motions comparable to the escape-speed from the star-forming cloud. After gas is expelled by feedback, these young clusters dissolve on a time-scale of a few million years. This occurs because a typical star's velocity, inherited from the parent cloud, will be larger thanthe escape speed from the cluster's own mass. \n\n\nThe nearest site of on-going massive star formation is located immediately behind the Orion Nebula at a distance of about 400 parsecs (1,300 light years). Observations over the last 15 years of have shown that a powerful explosion occurred here about 550 years ago (that is when the light from the region reached Earth). This event released more energy than the Sun puts out in ten million years. It was likely caused by the interaction of at least four stars embedded in the dense cloud core from which they formed. Two formed either a close binary, or more likely, merged to form an approximately 15 Solar mass object. This star, along with two others with masses of 3 and 10 times the Sun were ejected with speeds of about 10, 55, and 30 km/s, respectively, at the time of the explosion. \n\n\nWas the Orion protostellar explosion a unique event or the closest and most recent example of a new class of cosmic explosions? We found fossil evidence for a half-dozen explosive outflows in the Milky Way galaxy. All of these explosions occurred within the last 10,000 years. Given the small volume of the Galactic disk in which they were found, the Galactic rate of protostellar explosions must be comparable to the supernova rate; about one per century. Thus, it is likely that most massive stars experience such an event during their birth.\n\n\nWhat causes such explosions? Multi-body (N-body) interactions of single and multiple stars in high-density, compact clusters can lead to stellar collisions, mergers, and ejections. The energy of these explosions comes from the release of gravitational potential energy as a binary star is forced into a more compact configuration by an interaction with another star of binary, of the interaction leads to a merger.\n\n\nN-body interactions can produce flares which appear on a time scales of days to weeks and fade over years to decades. As the hot debris expands through a dense cloud core, it can produce fingers of ejecta such as observed in the Orion explosion and other candidate explosive outflows. The study of both cosmic and terrestrial explosions shows that the explosive release of energy surrounded by a damping medium tends to produce dozens to hundreds of fingers. The ejection speed of knots in these fingers tends to increase with increasing distance from the source.\n\n\nWhen massive stars interact or merge in a dense, visually opaque cores, the resulting energy emerges mostly at infrared wavelengths. Suchflares can reach luminosities millions of times that of the Sun and last for years. In this study, we explored the use of satellite data to find on-going explosions in nearby galaxies and found some candidates. \n\n\nInteractions among forming stars is ultra-dense, forming clusters may play an important role in determining the final masses of stars. If an N-body interaction ejects an object from its birth environment, its final mass will be set. It can only grow by the amount of material that can be dragged along by the star's gravity.  If the star is not accelerated or ejected, then it can grow until one of the above feedback mechanisms halts the accretion process.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/19/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JohnBally\n"
