 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Microelectronics-Photonics REU site for Tomorrow's Nanomanufacturing: Engineering with Science (TNEWS)at the University of Arkansas (UA) merges discovery-focused research with professional skills training to prepare a rising generation of leaders to speed translation of nano-scale materials, devices and processes to commercial manufacturing. To provide trans-disciplinary training as well as cultivate innovation, teamwork, and ethics, faculty from science and engineering disciplines collaborate with industry leaders in nanomanufacturing to mentor REU participants in laboratory discoveries within a framework of experiences in design, metrology, communication, and leadership. Participants will be recruited from minority-serving institution partners of UA and societies for female STEM students to broaden participation in STEM, with special consideration given to first-generation and economically disadvantaged students. Participants will be mentored by successful entrepreneurs to transform discovery to intellectual property from which peer-reviewed publications, patent applications and nanomanufacturing spinouts can emerge. Long-term engagement among TNEWS REU alumni will be facilitated as they advance to leadership in nanomanufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis REU Site at UA aims to provide (i) rewarding research experiences that bridge science and engineering; (ii) training to use broadly applicable emerging technologies relevant to nanomanufacturing; and (iii) development of professional skills to REU participants recruited from science and engineering undergraduates who are underrepresented in engineering, particularly first-generation and economically disadvantaged students. REU participants will conduct student-focused research projects on topics ranging from quantum to nanoscale materials discovery to devices and systems that integrate nanoarchitectures. Projects target biological, sensor, energy and electromagnetic technologies that offer commercializable innovations from which peer-reviewed publications, patent applications and nanomanufacturing spinouts can emerge. REU participants will interact regularly with faculty and industry mentors outside their immediate research laboratory to enhance student research and progress. This especially benefits women and minorities. TNEWS will train participants in innovation, design, metrology, teamwork, communication, ethics and leadership using a tested experiential learning framework that has contributed to five recent UA nanotech spin-offs. Integrating these experiences with cohort-building activities and mentored student sharing will nurture a cadre of emerging leaders in tomorrow?s nanomanufacturing workforce who grasp complex interactions between personal and community values to effectively and responsibly transform research discovery to commercializable innovations that create significant benefit. Outcomes relative to nine discrete learning objectives will be analyzed by a program evaluator using both novel and proven assessment methodologies to ensure participant progress and to refine and develop administration of the TNEWS REU site.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject overview: The TNEWS REU Site was implemented jointly at Utah State University (USU) and University of Arkansas (UA).  It engaged faculty advisors from science and engineering disciplines to collaborate with industry leaders in nanomanufacturing.  Together, these collaborators advised and mentored REU participants in discovery experiences involving research in quantum to nanoscale materials, devices and systems.\n\nIntellectual merit outcomes: Student participants engaged in research advised and mentored by faculty in laboratory settings and by industry in manufacturing operations.  Cohort-building activities and mentored student sharing prepared these students to take research from discovery to commercialization response to societal challenges. \n\nBroader impact outcomes: A diverse cadre of participants was recruited from minority-serving institutions and regional and community colleges that had geographic, historical, and shared interests with the host institutions.  In recruitment of REU participants, special consideration was given to applicants from communities underrepresented in engineering.  This included female, Black, Hispanic, Native American, and Pacific Islanders.  Additional consideration was given to recruit and support first-generation and economically disadvantaged students.  Peer and near-peer mentorind was used to support such historically underrepresented students to positive experiences and successful outcomes on their REU journey.  Industry alumni and colleagues provided real-world hands-on nanomanufacturing experiences.\n\nOverall project outcomes: Participants were engaged in experiences that included laboratory research, collaboration in innovation, design of experiments and devices, and exposure to industrial manufacturing.  Students developed skills in teamwork, communication, ethics and leadership.  The transdisciplinary REU environment provided unique experiences to prepare participants with skills and capabilities to be innovative leaders in tomorrows nanomanufacturing sector. An independent evaluator identified significant improvements in learning by REU participants. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/13/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donald K Roper"
