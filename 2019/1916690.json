 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a 2-day Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI) meeting at Case Western Reserve University. The meeting will enable collaborations between amateur radio operators and the science community for the purpose of advancing scientific research and understanding of the ionosphere by leveraging radio propagation experiments. It will encourage development of new technologies to support ionospheric research and provide educational opportunities for the amateur community and the general public. The conference will also provide professional development and networking opportunities for students and early career scientists and engineers. \r\n\r\nThis award will support the Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI) meeting to be held March 22-23, 2019 at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH. This meeting will facilitate presentations and discussions on research advances in radio remote sensing techniques and space weather. This workshop will enable professional scientists and amateur radio operators to work together to design a new network of citizen science radio instrumentation and to allow for the discussion and presentation of results and techniques using the currently available data. The meeting will engage citizen scientists in space weather research and also provide educational opportunities for the ham operator community and the general public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This quality provides a unique perspective and excellent citizen science potentials when asking scientific questions or even analyzing observations.
