 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lahars, or volcanic mud flows, produce infrasound (low-frequency acoustic energy) that can be detected from distances of many kilometers.  As such, it is possible to remotely characterize these hazardous mud flows by tracking their flow positions and energetics through time.  This work seeks to develop infrasound analytical tools to locate where lahars initiate, how far and fast they move, and estimate their mass flow. Toward these goals the project will deploy and maintain seismic and infrasonic instruments at Fuego Volcano (Guatemala), where lahars are common during the rainy season (April through September).  Rain gauges and time lapse cameras will be installed at locations along the lahar paths to understand how lahars initiate and to validate flow characteristics through direct observation. Fuego volcano is an ideal candidate for this study because of its frequent lahars and relatively easy access and because information learned will be applicable for mitigating risks.  Lessons learned at Fuego may then be applied to dozens of volcanoes in the US and around the world where lahar activity is common.  The project aims to train several graduate and undergraduate students from the US and result in scientific publication. Important capacity building in Guatemala will result from the training of Guatemalan scientists and technology transfer to observatory staff. \r\n\r\nThis project will improve our understanding of the seismo-acoustic source mechanisms associated with lahars, and to develop methods that can be used to track such sources and other rapid gravity-driven mass movements.  Through multi-parametric observations this study will contribute to our fundamental understanding of how lahars are triggered during precipitation events and where material is incorporated along the lahar flow path.  Infra-acoustic arrays and broadband seismic sensors will be deployed at Fuego Volcano (Guatemala) with the intent to remotely monitor the most frequent channels that carry lahars during the rainy season.  Signal processing techniques using data from an integrated network of arrays will be used to track and quantify flow energetics.  Fuego provides an ideal field site where seismo-acoustic data will be combined with contemporaneous rainfall and geomorphologic (terrain and channel slope) observations.  Computer vision techniques will be used to quantify timing, mass flow, and velocities of lahars at various positions along channels.  This work merges geomorphology and geophysical approaches to study hazardous lahar phenomena.  Broader impacts include development of applied technology for hazard mitigation and training of both US-based and Guatemala-based students and professionals. \r\n\r\nThis award is cofunded by the PredicMon of and Resilience against Extreme Events (PREEVENTS) program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nLahars, or volcanic mud flows, can be impactful for people living on the flanks of volcanoes. Both primary lahars, caused by an eruption, and secondary lahars, induced by rainfall on loose volcanic soils, can induce slurries of mud, boulders, and debris that can race downwards and erode valleys creating steep canyon walls. Farther from volcanoes they can travel tens of kilometers and spread out on floodplains destroying agricultural lands and otherwise impacting communities. A devastating lahar in Colombia in 1985, for instance, was responsible for killing more than 23,000 people including about 20,000 in the City of Armero. Scientists consider that lahar hazards in regions of the United States like the Cascades, in the Pacific Northwest, represent the most significant potential volcanic impact.\r\n\n\nVolcanic mudflows travel quickly, but with adequate monitoring their advance may be detected prior to these damaging flows reaching at-risk communities. This work focused on the development of new tools to robustly detect lahars from a distance. An applied outcome is to relay this information to impacted communities in a timely manner. Specifically, this study explored the capabilities of using infrasonic sensors, which record the low-frequency sound energy produced by lahars, to locate and track moving mud flows and determine how fast they advance and how energetic they are. Toward these goals, we worked on the slopes of an active laboratory volcano (Volcn de Fuego in Guatemala) where secondary lahars are common during that country's rainy season. Some river valleys at Fuego are so active that they can convey several lahars each week triggered during afternoon thunderstorms. We instrumented several drainages and deployed both infrasonic networks of sensors along with seismometers, capable of detecting ground vibrations, as well as time lapse and video cameras. We also used data that are collected by the local monitoring agency, INSIVUMEH, who are actively working to incorporate infrasound triggers for real-time lahar alerts.\r\n\n\nResults of this project show promise for remote detection of volcanic mudflows using infrasound technology. We explored the strategic positioning of geophysical monitoring tools and wrote software to analyze infrasound data using array technology. Results were presented in professional scientific meetings and in peer-reviewed journal articles. We determined that infrasound sensing of (even) small lahars is possible using arrays of sensors from a distance as far as 5 km. When coupled with cell phone alerts this could provide tens of minutes of warning that a lahar is flowing down the volcano. An outreach component of this project led to the development of a 3D immersive experience (website) giving the public an opportunity to learn about the science and to virtually visit the Fuego Volcano field site.\r\n\n\nBroader impacts of this project include the development of hardware and software for low-cost infrasound sensors, which are used to study a range of geophysical phenomena, including eruptions, gravity-driven mass movements (like lahars and snow avalanches), earthquakes, and fluvial (river) processes. We also published datasets that are publicly available so that other researchers can analyze seismo-acoustic signals from lahars. Finally, drone-based observations were incorporated in our studies to make detailed maps of lahar drainages before and after mudflow activity. This work provided several opportunities for exchanges of Guatemalan and U.S.-based scientists to visit the U.S. and Guatemala respectively. Undergraduate and graduate students from Boise State University were trained in geophysics and field work as part of this research.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JeffreyBJohnson\n"
