 "awd_abstract_narration": "Particle physics is focused on the search for the most basic building blocks of the Universe and the rules that bind them. The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located near Geneva, Switzerland is the world's most powerful particle accelerator, able to reach the highest particle energies in a laboratory setting.   The CMS detector at the LHC is one of the world's most powerful and sophisticated cameras, observing the collisions of protons and recording the outcomes for detailed study by CMS experimentalists. The members of the high energy physics group at Rutgers University have been crucial to the construction, maintenance, and continued improvement of the device itself. They have initiated and guided several studies of the data collected, including ones that led to the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. The data being gathered now and in the coming years will allow a greater understanding of the basic structure of nature, perhaps including insights into the huge difference in the strengths of the fundamental forces, or even glimpses of new fundamental particles. The Rutgers high energy physics group will continue to be at the forefront of these investigations. \r\n\r\nThe Rutgers high energy physics group is carrying out several with the CMS experiment at CERN, studying proton-proton interactions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.  They continue to innovate and implement new data analysis techniques in searches for new physics signatures with leptons, photons, jets and missing energy. They are also incorporating ideas like high-speed pattern recognition, deep multivariate neural networks, self-guided machine learning, and image recognition into the search for new physics at the deepest levels. The group has a history of leadership in CMS, including leading major analysis groups and leading efforts on detector hardware and operations in the areas of tracking, calorimetry and luminosity measurement. They work closely with theorists to bring forth new ideas, leading to a rich program of physics analyses that has originated from their efforts.  This award also allows the Rutgers group to continue deploying an improved version of front-end electronics they designed for the pixel detector, as well as testing and installation of the front-end electronics for the forward hadron calorimeter. They are also working on longer-term upgrades, specifically the Outer Tracker and a fast Track Trigger, introducing innovative ideas that promise to increase the reach for new physics to regions not previously capable of being probed by any collider. They plan to host a production and testing facility for the upgrades. \r\n\r\nThrough the Rutgers QuarkNet program, the group runs summer workshops for high-school teachers and students from across New Jersey, analyzing LHC data and building cosmic-ray telescopes. They also mentor undergraduate students from Rutgers and the NSF REU program, as well as qualified high school students. These students work closely with the group and contribute to ongoing studies and physics analyses. To address the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields, they are helping develop programs to provide research opportunities to collegiate and pre-college women. They have developed a highly successful intensive instructional program for high school physics teachers in AP-level physics which has led to improved student understanding of physics, and a marked increase in perfect scores on the AP-physics exam. The Rutgers group continues to convey the excitement of particle physics with frequent talks at local high schools, libraries, and other venues.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Rutgers experimental high energy physics group continues to innovate new ways to search for signatures of physics processes that could explain the mysteries at the heart of our current understanding. The group works on the CMS detector on the Large Hadron Collider and uses data collected to probe nature at the smallest scales and highest energies.\n\nOur current understanding of how nature works is summarized in a set of rules known as the \"Standard Model of Particles and Fields\" or SM for short.  However, it contains within it flaws that indicate it cannot be the ultimate theory of nature.\n\n\nThe crowning achievement of the SM was the discovery of the Higgs boson, in which the Rutgers group played a critical part.  But the very lightness of the Higgs boson -- over a million-trillion times smaller than the fundamental mass scale of Quantum Mechanics known as the Planck Scale -- signals there must be phenomena as yet undiscovered to cause this imbalance.  This mystery is known as the \"Hierarchy Problem\".\n\n\nParticle physics has been hunting for the fix to the Hierarchy Problem for decades.  One of the most compelling solutions is called Supersymmetry which posits as-yet-undiscovered particles to partner with known particles.  The Rutgers group has innovated several clever techniques to search for these Supersymmetric partners, working with theory colleagues to understand how to discriminate new physics from the morass of data from normal reactions. \n\n\nThe search for new physics processes that solve the Hierarchy Problem and other mysteries in the SM are different from previous searches for missing pieces of the SM itself such as the W and Z bosons (found in the 1980's), the top quark (1990's) and the Higgs boson (2012).  We lack the usual guideposts, the mass and reaction rates (governed by a variable called \"coupling\") can be tiny, or massive.  After decades of searches the smaller masses and higher couplings have been mostly ruled out.  There are hints of possible new physics in data analyzed by the Rutgers group, including a possible hint of new phenomena at 8-trillion times the proton mass.\n\n\nNew physics phenomena could well occur at lower masses, near those of the W/Z and Higgs bosons, but at such a low coupling that the interesting reactions are overwhelmed by commonplace ones.  The Rutgers group works closely with theory colleagues to innovate new techniques including new forms of Artificial Intelligence.  One such intriguing new avenue is a sophisticated approach is called anomaly detection, which combs through the data learning salient features of normal reactions and uses that information to flag reactions that look atypical.  If these types of Artificial Intelligence guided searches are successful, one can imagine anomaly detection having broad applications outside high energy physics searches. \n\nThe Rutgers group has also pioneered searches for new phenomena at low masses.  While lower mass physics has been thoroughly searched for by previous generations of experiments, there are compelling reasons to believe this low mass new physics could have been out of their reach. For instance, new physics reaction rates could be so low as to have been invisible to previous experiments.  They could be long-lived and not decay in the confines of the detectors.  Their appearance could mimic normal physics signatures.\n\nIn addition to new analysis techniques the Rutgers group is designing and building new hardware and algorithms to access and process data at the upgraded version of the Large Hadron Collider which will collide protons a rate much too high for current data collection strategies. Groundbreaking new technology will allow a preliminary processing and categorization of raw data into physics signatures at nearly the rate of the proton collisions: forty-million times a second!  This ultrafast processing promises to open up areas of low mass and low coupling that were not thought accessible to searches for new physics at colliders.\n\n\nSharing the excitement of physics has always been a Rutgers priority. The group has hosted groups of high school students under the aegis ofthe NSF Quarknet program for several years.  These students participate in many facets of experimental particle physics work including building detectors and analyzing data from detectors.  They learn the basics of fundamental physics and data analysis techniques. They grapple with concepts of numerical statistics and quantifying uncertainties.  The two week Quarknet program prepares them for work in fields that require precise and quantitative thinking.  The group has also hosted NSF REU students for several years.  These students are college students from institutions that may not have a particle physics research group.  These students work with our research groups and gain valuable experience.  Many of them go on to graduate schools in physics and related fields.  The group also has a strong presence in organizations that promote women and underrepresented minorities in physics and STEM fields including underserved areas of the world.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eva Halkiadakis"
