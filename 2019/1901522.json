 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditionally, mathematics studies precise solutions: one has for example an equation with an unknown quantity 'x', and wants to know precisely which value(s) of x make it true. Often in the real world, good approximate solutions will always be very close to precise solutions, and are therefore just as good for practical purposes.  However, sometimes very good approximate solutions to a problem can exist without there being any actual solution at all: for example, this is a fundamental phenomenon in parts of semi-conductor physics that are closely related to the 'K-theoretic' methods used in this project.  The ideas of finding approximate solutions to problems and seeing what can be done with them versus precise solutions permeate these research projects.  The PI will continue his own research in these directions, as well as mentor and advise junior researchers, disseminate the results of this to the broader community.\r\n\r\nThe methods used, and problems studied, in this project come from operator algebras (a branch of mathematics motivated by quantum physics), group theory (the study of symmetry), and K-theory (a way of measuring \"twistedness\" phenomena in geometry).  The PI will study fundamental classification problems in the theory of operator algebras by first solving approximate versions; this uses intrinsically low-dimensional phenomena in the structure of such objects, as recently revealed by other researchers.  In contrast, the PI intends to study high-dimensional obstructions to the existence of approximate solutions to systems of matrix-equations governed by symmetry groups.  Finally, the PI intends to study the surprising analytic phenomena that come up around the failure of exactness, and the connections of this to geometry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe mathematics underlying quantum systems is inherently more complicated that that underlying classical physical systems.  The basic reason for this is the presence of 'non-commutativity': this means that the order in which one carries out operations matters, as it would when you are multiplying matrices, but not when you are multiplying numbers.\n\nOne central purpose of this project was to study the range of validity of the so-called 'Universal Coefficient Theorem'.  This posits that any 'quantum system' (more precisely, an 'amenable C*-algebra') can be approximated by a 'classical' (in other words, commutative) system.  As the classical system is easier to deal with, this gives one a great deal of additional computational power, and is a central leg of a 40-year program to completely classify (in other words, to write down a complete list of) C*-algebras satisfying appropriate restrictions.  With my collaborators and students we made significant progress on this (but did not solve it completely); we continue to work on developing our tools, and are also working on applying them to problems in physics. \n\nThe tools my collaborators and I developed to understand amenable group actions are closely related; thanks to our work and subsequent developments by others, our theory is now expected to give a definitive framework, and has already been used substantially in classification results.\n\n A second main purpose supported by this work is in rigidity problems, which ask how much of an underlying classical (or geometric) system an associated quantum system remembers.  In the setting of 'coarse' (or large-scale: think of objects as viewed from a great distance) my collaborators and I attained a definitive answer, which works in complete generality.  The techniques we developed to solve this problem have now been applied elsewhere, and led to interesting off-shoots in graph theory and geometry.\n\nThe main broader impacts of this project concern the training of junior researchers.  This includes my own Masters and PhD students, some of whom are continuing in careers in STEM education, including one in a leadership position at my own institution.  I have also been involved in efforts to broaden participation in mathematics, and support the success of junior researchers, through initiatives such as summer schools and mentorship programs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/14/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rufus Willett"
