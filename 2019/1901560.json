 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer modeling of multiphase flows and thermal transport is important in a host of industrial and natural applications.  These include blood flow in the human circulatory system, flow of oil and water in porous media associated with enhanced oil recovery, and boiling and condensation associated with heat transfer operations.  Despite its importance, advanced graduate instruction in computational methods in multiphase transport is available at very few universities.   This award, to support the 2019 Summer Research School on Fluid Dynamics, will address that need.  The 2019 summer program will focus on modeling and simulation of multiphase flow and thermal transport.  The program will help train roughly 50 graduate students from across the country through a series of lectures and interactive tutorials by invited experts.  In addition, students will have the opportunity to build a network and community of researchers through informal interactions and poster sessions throughout this week-long course.  \r\n\r\nThe 2019 Summer Research School will focus on the physical and mathematical aspects of modeling and simulating the behavior of multiphase flow and thermal transport directly at the scale of the fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfaces.  Modeling and simulation of these processes is critical to a broad range of industrial and natural applications.  However, despite a long history of activity, a number of challenges remain associated with accuracy, efficiency, capabilities, and robustness of simulation techniques.  Recent progress has led to numerous methods that are now available to address various aspects of these challenges.   The summer school will provide lectures on multiphase flow theory, numerical methods for multiphase flow, and multiphase flow applications.  Lectures will cover phase change heat transfer, interface physics, simulation of boiling, immersed boundary methods, interfacial transport, phase field methods, and particulate flows.  Interactive tutorials will complement the lectures and introduce students to some of the difficulties related to post-processing data.  Professional development of the students will include opportunities to present their research through a poster session and extensive opportunities to meet and network with the summer school instructors, who are a mix of distinguished experts and active, early career faculty members.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
