 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California, San Diego, deploys Triton Stratus, an addition to its existing high performance computing system that allows campus researchers in many schools and departments to apply computational methods to their scientific research.  Triton Stratus helps researchers advance their scientific aims by providing improved facilities for accessing emerging computing tools and scaling them to commercial cloud computing resources.  Researchers, especially data scientists, are increasingly using tools such as Jupyter notebooks and RStudio to implement computational and data analysis functions and workflows. Jupyter notebooks provide a web-browser-based environment that permits the assembly of text, graphics, and computing functions into a living laboratory notebook, promoting research documentation and reproducibility. RStudio is another tool growing in popularity which provides a graphical environment for the R statistical language, widely used for data analysis.  These tools are part of a general trend in research computing towards web-based and graphical interfaces, especially for attracting newer generations of researchers and data scientists. Triton Stratus runs JupyterHub server and RStudio server, addressing the interactive computing needs of scientists from various domain sciences.\r\n\r\nThe project delivers a productive research computing capability serving investigators in different scientific domains.  Triton Stratus permits exploration of the emerging hybrid model of on-premise cluster computing resources coupled with commercial cloud computing services and will help answer questions such as the right balance of on-premise and cloud resources, best modes for scaling or bursting to cloud resources, and investigating new models of interactive research computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe CC* Compute: Triton Stratus project delivered new capabilities to UC San Diego scientists for conducting interactive data analysis and for using commercial \"cloud\" computing facilities across a range of scientific domains.  Access to high performance computing and supercomputing systems for simulation and data analysis has traditionally been through a \"batch scheduling\" system (submit a computing job and wait for it to run, similar to older \"time sharing\" systems that some may be familiar with).  In recent years, due to evolving technology, users of high performance computing systems are increasingly interested in \"interactive\" or immediate-access computing models.  The Jupyter Notebooks interactive software is particularly popular among scientists because it facilitates using a web browser to integrate scientific computation, data analysis, graphics, and prose into a \"living\" laboratory notebook.  Jupyter Notebooks not only facilitate analysis and presentation of scientific data, but provide for repeatability of scientific research, an increasingly important topic as more research becomes data-driven.  The Triton Stratus project augmented an existing batch-scheduled computational cluster with additional computing capacity to support use of Jupyter Notebooks and other interactive computing tasks for scientific research.  The resource was extended beyond UC San Diego through integration with the Open Science Grid, which facilitates global access to scientific computing resources.  The project also created a capability to transfer tested Jupyter Notebooks to commercial cloud computing facilities, such as Amazon Web Services, to provide for rapid scaling of computing tasks and analysis of large scientific data sets stored in cloud facilities (such as \"biobank\" projects for population-scale health studies). The Triton Stratus project explored and dealt with some important technical aspects of providing these capabilities, such as cybersecurity and \"cloud integration.\"  Cybersecurity is an increasingly important aspect of scientific research especially when dealing with sensitive data such as human DNA sequence data.  Cloud integration involves technologies such as the \"Kubernetes\" software system, which manages packaged or \"containerized\" computational tasks and facilitates moving them between on-premise and remote computing facilities for access to more resources and different data sets.  Research supported by the Triton Stratus project to date includes new materials design, metagenomics studies, microbiome research, phylogenetics, and RNA therapeutics research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/02/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ronald B Hawkins"
