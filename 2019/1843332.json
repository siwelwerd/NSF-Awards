 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a protein sample preparation kit that eliminates variability and provides researchers with the information they need to find important protein drug targets and biomarkers.  The high throughput protein analysis methods of proteomics are having a significant impact on the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, from the development of new protein-based drugs to quality control monitoring and biomarker discovery to clinical diagnostics. All proteomics applications require robust, repeatable and automatable sample preparation methods. Currently, however, these methods are not standardized. The lack of the standardization often leads to experimental failure and unreliable results, which may require many rounds of experimental repeats, costing time and money. Standardized protein sample preparation kits will provide significant workflow savings, improve time to market, and accelerate biomarker discovery and drug development.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a universal peptide isolation kit to serve the diverse needs of the proteomics community.  Currently, methods for sample preparation typically have more than a dozen steps, are prone to peptide loss and bias, and require more than a day to complete.  Through the NSF I-Corps program, it was discovered that more than 70% of researchers in academia and industry are unhappy with current protein sample preparation methods.  To address this need, a sample preparation kit that increases the speed and efficiency of peptide sample preparation was developed. The approach differs from current methods in three fundamental ways.  First, all manipulations will be done in solution in a single tube with half the number of steps compared to existing protocols. Second, a fast, universal, and reversible chemical tag is employed rather than relying on physical separation, preventing sample loss or bias. Third, a stabilized derivative of trypsin will allow for complete digestion of protein samples followed by efficient removal of intact and fragmented trypsin, preventing contamination.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

If sample preparation isn?t done well, it can jeopardize the entire project, resulting in huge losses in both time and money.&nbsp; Current methods for protein sample preparation suffer from high sample loss, long processing times, poor reproducibility, and low protein coverage.&nbsp; In this project, we set out to develop a new method for the extraction and cleanup of protein sample for biomarker and drug discovery projects.&nbsp; We utilized a reversible chemical tag, called ProMTag, to tag, capture, cleanup and release pure proteins ready for analysis in an easy-to-use workflow.&nbsp; This workflow is called the <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">U</span></strong>niversal <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">P</span></strong>rotein <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">E</span></strong>xtraction and <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">C</span></strong>leanup <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">K</span></strong>it (UPECK).&nbsp; We also developed a modified version of trypsin that is able to digest an entire protein sample in one hour and, after digestion, is captured and removed from the sample, preventing contamination of the final sample by trypsin or trypsin fragments.&nbsp; Taken together, this study showed the incredible potential for this ProMTag system to accelerate protein extraction and cleanup to ensure quality analysis and data acquisition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We began this study by exploring how well UPECK worked in various buffers and model systems.&nbsp; We showed that our protein sample preparation workflow had yields greater than 85% in all detergent containing lysis buffers tested.&nbsp; We also showed that this workflow was compatible with many different sample types, including brain tissue samples, yeast samples, bacteria samples, and fruit fly embryo samples.&nbsp; When we compared our sample preparation workflow yields to others that are commonly used today in these buffers and model systems, we found that our yields were consistently higher than others in all detergent containing buffers that we tested.&nbsp; This showed that we have the potential to have a positive impact in the field by preventing protein loss that occurs in other protein sample preparation workflows.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this study, we also showed that the trypsin variant that we created and incorporated into the UPECK workflow, called mP12-trypsin, was able to completely digest proteins into peptides in one hour.&nbsp; Additionally, we were able to completely remove the mP12-trypsin from the sample after digestion to prevent trypsin contamination in the final sample.&nbsp; Mass spectrometry analysis showed that we had little to no trypsin contamination in our final protein samples and significantly less as compared to other protein sample workflows that utilize trypsin.&nbsp; This showed that we not only improved upon recovery and yield with UPECK, but we also improved digestion and prevented contamination of the final sample.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people use protein sample preparation before mass spectrometry analysis, so we compared our UPECK workflow to other commonly used workflows using mass spectrometry including protein precipitation and two commercially available kits.&nbsp; The sample prepared using UPECK had a higher number of spectra, more identified proteins, more unique proteins, higher protein coverage, and a lower false discovery rate than all of the other workflows that were tested.&nbsp; Taken together this showed that UPECK can prevent protein loss, prevent trypsin contamination, and allows for the highest number of protein identifications and coverage.&nbsp; Because mass spectrometry is so important for biomarker and drug discovery, what this translates to is the potential for real world impact by accelerating and improving the pipeline for biomarker and drug discovery.&nbsp; Our workflow can help others identify more proteins that may be important for biomarker and drug discovery, ensuring that they can see the whole, clear biological picture and can find what they are looking for faster with greater confidence.&nbsp; This not only save time and money, but it saves lives by empowering researchers to develop new life saving drugs, biomarkers, and diagnostics.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/29/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Amber&nbsp;Lucas</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1843332/1843332_10587719_1588188502342_Workflow2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1843332/1843332_10587719_1588188502342_Workflow2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Universal Protein Extraction and Cleanup Kit (UPECK) workflow\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1843332/1843332_10587719_1588188502342_Workflow2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Universal Protein Extraction and Cleanup Kit (UPECK) workflow\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The UPECK workflow developed in this study utilizes reversible chemistry and modified trypsin to extract, tag, capture, wash, release, and digest (optional) protein samples from any model organism and in any buffer to prepare them for analysis.
