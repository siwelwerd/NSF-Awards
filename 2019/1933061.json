 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the development of multicellular tissues, the formation of shape and pattern occur in fairly standard ways.  Homogeneous cell populations are triggered to autonomously self-organize into structured, multicellular tissues.  However, the signals that guide this organization remain a mystery, and these processes do not consistently occur properly or completely in an a laboratory culture environment.  The goal of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to develop a microfluidic system in which the culture environment can be precisely controlled so that tissue development from stem cells can be directed towards reproducible structures.  Correct tissue development requires both biochemical and mechanical signals, which will be precisely controllable through this system.  These signals then trigger gene expression within initially homogeneous sets of cells so that they begin a developmental path.  The microfluidic system will also be compatible with live imaging, to support future advanced studies into mechanisms driving cellular organization and tissue development.  Improved understanding of 3D tissue development into correctly organized structures will significantly enhance research related to developmental biology, including congenital malformations, as well as tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.  Educational and outreach plans include integrating high school students, with priority given to women and underrepresented minorities, into the lab for a 4-8 week research experience as well as engaging undergraduates in research.  These projects will also provide an opportunity for senior graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to gain mentorship experience.  A new course is also being developed related to stem cell biotechnology and regenerative medicine, which will directly draw on the advances in science that support this research.\r\n  \r\nThis cross-disciplinary project involves stem cell biology, developmental biology, signal transduction, mechanobiology, and microfluidics.  The objectives of this study are to develop a microfluidic device and use it to achieve controllable synthesis of both the epiblast cyst (a columnar tissue) and the amniotic cyst (a squamous tissue) from human pluripotent stem cells.  The multi-chambered, microfluidic system will vary both cell loading and chemical induction factors.  Cell seeding will be assessed with confocal imaging.  Live imaging and immunostaining will be used to monitor mofphogenetic dynamics of the cyst formation, including lumenogenesis (cavity formation) as well as changes in cell shape.  Cell fate will be confirmed by staining for epiblast and amniotic lineage markers, and the dynamics of epithelialization will be examined at varying time points.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview: A long-standing question in biology is how tissue shape and pattern are generated during development.  Recent studies of the formation of organ-like structures or embryo models from human stem cells in a culture dish have provided new information about the self-organizing properties during multicellular tissue formation.  However, it remains unclear how an initially homogeneous stem cell population in a culture dish is triggered to undergo complex cell-cell interactions and autonomously self-organize into patterned multicellular tissues.  This NSF project is set to specifically address the significant challenge in understanding multicellular self-organization during development, using stem cell-based culture models in a culture dish. \n\n \nIntellectual Merit Outcome: A central goal of this NSF project is to develop new understanding of multicellular self-organization during development using stem cell-based culture models in a culture dish.  To achieve this goal, our research has integrated knowledge and tools from stem cell biology, developmental biology, mechanobiology and microfluidics.  Specifically, our research has led to the development of a stem cell-based human development model, termed the post-implantation amniotic sac embryoid (PASE), that recapitulates multiple post-implantation developmental events.  To strengthen the controllability and reproducibility of the PASE model, we have further utilized microfluidic tools to achieve the development of a microfluidic PASE model, using which we have further elucidated intricate cell-cell interactions and their roles in driving continuous cellular differentiation and tissue formation.  Using microfluidic tools, we have further achieved the development of multicellular tissues that mimic certain aspects of early human neural tissue development, including regional patterning of the neural tube.  Altogether, the new models and data generated from our studies could assist in the rational design of differentiation protocols of human stem cells for disease modelling and cell therapy, and in high-throughput drug and toxicity screens to prevent pregnancy failure and birth defects. \n\n \n\nBroader Impact Outcome: Our research has fostered transformative progress in understanding self-organized multicellular tissue development.  Our research has enabled drastic advances in controllable and reproducible generations of multicellular tissues and thus contribute significantly to regenerative therapies, disease modeling and screening applications.  Our educational activities have broad impacts on students from different educational levels and genders and ethnicities.  The technologies and tools developed in our studies have been utilized as vehicles for outreach activities to K-12 students and other underrepresented female and minority students in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti school districts.  Our outreach activities have revealed to K-12 students exciting challenges in science and engineering and their close relevance to our society, thus motivating them to pursue science and engineering curricula. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/04/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jianping Fu"
