 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peer tutoring, in which one student teaches material to another student, has been proven to increase learning, especially for the student who is taking on the role of teacher. This is because detecting and correcting mistakes often requires the student teacher to reflect on their own knowledge to develop explanations,  reinforcing their knowledge of the subject matter. The effectiveness of such peer tutoring, however, depends on how learners behave -- if they pick up the subject too quickly, the student teacher may benefit less; if they pick it up too slowly, the teacher may get frustrated or confused themselves. An alternative is to have the learner pretend not to know the subject and help guide the teacher by \"back leading\" -- asking the right questions, making occasional \"mistakes\", etc. To this end, the goal of this research is to develop a social robot that plays the role of learner, guiding the student teacher using both verbal and non-verbal behaviors, modeling both the cognitive and emotional state of the student, and providing feedback and encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on developing multi-modal communication for a social robot that provides cognitive and emotional support of students who are trying to teach the robot multi-step mathematical problem solving.  The student and robot collaborate around a \"smart\" whiteboard that forms the joint focal point for learning. Concepts from Theory of Mind are used to infer the affective state of the student from their multi-modal behaviors and to provide support and encouragement, with the goal of facilitating the student persevering in the task and developing meta-cognitive skills to teach more effectively. Concepts from Common Ground Theory are used to generate robot actions, such as asking questions or making deliberate mistakes, to help guide the student teacher to better explain the concept, through an interactive presentation/acceptance process. As part of this project, a robot ambassador is being developed that can explain robotics and STEM to middle-school students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere are many factors that influence a person?s ability to learn new concepts.  One important factor is the teacher?s emotional response to the learner, such as praising them for doing well.  It has been shown that such responses improve learning rates for human teachers and students.  Our hypothesis is that similar effects can be shown when the teacher is a robot.  Specifically, we wanted to test a hypothesis that affective behavior by the robot could improve human?s learning outcomes.  This included algorithmic development and user studies.\n\nWe developed a simple sorting game where cards belong in one of two bins based on a pre-defined rule that is known to the robot  but not the person.   For instance, a rule could be that all red cards go in the left bin and all other cards go in the right bin, where cards have different color, shapes, number, and fill. The goal is for the robot to present  a series of cards from which the user would learn the rule by placing the card in the correct bin, with the robot providing feedback as to whether the user chose the correct bin.  We developed an algorithm that presents cards in the optimal order for a person to learn the rule most efficiently, based on which hypotheses are eliminated by a particular choice of card.\n\nTo determine how people interpret a robot?s affective behavior, we ran an online study where people were asked to rate the emotional contact of different actions, such as leaning forward, raising arms, moving quickly.  We found good correlation between what people perceived the robot?s affect and what psychological literature reported on the affect of different motions.  Based on this, we ran several experiments using the sorting game, where in the base condition the robot merely reported whether the user had chosen the correct bin and in the experimental condition the robot used a behavior that people perceived as happy when the person chose the correct bin and a different, sad behavior when they were incorrect.  Overall, people learned the rule faster in the experimental condition and, in some cases, reported that the rule was easier to learn in the experimental condition.  We also ran a reverse study, where the robot appeared happy when the user got it wrong, and vice versa.  In that case, no significant difference was seen from the baseline condition that had no affective behavior. \n\nAs far as we know, this is the first time that affective behavior has been shown to improve learning outcomes (previous work had showed that people preferred tutors that exhibit affective behavior, but did not note increases in learning).  The results also match what is known from the pedagogical literature regarding affective feedback from teachers.  Going forward, we would like to correlate the feedback with the perceived affect of the learner along with an understanding of how likely it is that they would get the correct answer, given what they should have learned so far.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/17/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Reid G Simmons"
