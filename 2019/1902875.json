Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Daniel A. Bragg is \"Geometry of Supersingular Varieties \". The host institution for the fellowship is University of California, Berkeley and the sponsoring scientist is Martin Olsson.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

My third proposed project on derived equivalences in positive characteristic resulted in several papers. In my publication ``Derived invariants from topological Hochschild homology'' (with Benjamin Antieau) I proved some new results concerning the derived invariance of certain quantities in positive characteristic, including Hodge numbers, Betti numbers, and Artin-Mazur heights. In my publication ``Hodge numbers are not derived invariants in positive characteristic'' (with Nicolas Addington) I found an example of pair of derived equivalent Calabi-Yau 3-folds in positive characteristic which have different Hodge numbers. In my publication ``Lifts of twisted {K}3 surfaces to characteristic 0'' I proved some new results on twisted K3 surfaces in positive and mixed characteristic. In particular, I proved that every twisted K3 surface in characteristic p lifts to characteristic 0, generalizing a result of Deligne, and constructed moduli spaces of twisted K3 surfaces over the integers. I applied this theory as well as techniques related to derived equivalences and Fourier-Mukai transforms in my publication ``Twisted derived equivalences and isogenies between K3 surfaces in positive characteristic'' (with Ziquan Yang) to prove some arithmetic results on K3 surfaces.
