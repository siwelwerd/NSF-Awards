 "awd_abstract_narration": "How does information spread within a system over time? How is this related to the intrinsic structure of \r\nthe system? Mathematical models are developed to understand and make predictions about the \r\nbehavior of highly complex processes and structures. Richer and more realistic models can be obtained \r\nby increasing their 'roughness'; here we may think of the intricate branching of large networks like the \r\nInternet. In addition, incorporating randomness can help to better describe the interactions between \r\nthe elements that compose the model, for instance between different web servers. The area of \r\nmathematics concerned with the analysis of random processes and structures is called probability \r\ntheory. This project aims to apply probability theory to better understand the interconnections between \r\nthe random processes, the geometry, and the analysis of rough spaces and random geometric models. \r\n \r\nThe research supported by this award aims to investigate stochastic processes in rough spaces and \r\nfunctionals of random sets. The PI will analyze the behavior of diffusion processes intrinsic to fractal-like \r\nspaces, where classical concepts such as derivatives or canonical measures are less straightforward or \r\nnot even available. Special attention will be paid to the study of functional inequalities and gradient \r\nestimates to gain further insight into the connections between the process and the geometry of the \r\nunderlying space. Besides, the PI will analyze properties of large spatial data sets modeled by point \r\nprocesses with long range dependencies. Here, the focus lies on geometric and potential-theoretic \r\naspects of random covering sets and the asymptotic behavior of statistics employed in the detection of \r\nrare events. The PI expects that the methods and techniques developed will lead to progress on current \r\nquestions in mathematical physics, material and data sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
