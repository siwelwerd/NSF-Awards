 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Proactive Health (ProHealth) Informatics Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at Indiana University Bloomington will teach ten college students how to do research for eight weeks. They will make smart health systems to help people take care of their health. Students may be from groups that do not often go into computing research. Students will build intelligent, pervasive systems that monitor health and help people make better choices. The students' work will contribute to the fields of human-computer interaction, pervasive computing and advanced analytics. This research should improve the health of all United States citizens. Students will conduct their research with children and older adults.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the ProHealth REU Site is to train undergraduates from diverse backgrounds to become the next generation of researchers who design, develop, and evaluate intelligent, pervasive systems that empower lay people to proactively manage their health. Innovations include the design of new mobile or wearable health systems that integrate seamlessly into a person's life while providing valuable and appropriately shared feedback. The ProHealth site will provide undergraduates with the opportunity to conduct research with world-renowned faculty members in the fields of human computer interaction, pervasive computing (mobile or wearable), environmental sensing (ambient and on-body) and machine learning. The ProHealth REU site will actively recruit students from traditionally underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), including first generation college students, and students who do not have access to research opportunities. The undergraduate students will have the opportunity to: (1) learn how to design and build new mobile, wearable or ambient health systems; (2) use the data collected from these systems to improve one's performance or create personalized recommendations; (3) investigate the implications of data collected at the individual and community level; or (4) understand the needs of various populations to design better technology. These projects can potentially improve the health of the broader United States population. Undergraduate researchers will learn how to: conduct ethical research; document their progress; represent themselves professionally online; prepare for graduate school; network in professional settings; appropriately disseminate one's findings through writing and presentation; and prepare oneself for future career opportunities. In addition, the ProHealth REU team will inspire lifelong learners - from K-12 to older adults - to consider computing through interactive experiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
