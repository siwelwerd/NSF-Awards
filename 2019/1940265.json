 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant broadens the participation of the next generation of researchers in operations research by providing funding for graduate and undergraduate students interested in research from underrepresented groups in engineering to attend the annual meeting of INFORMS (Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences). The grant contributes to the prosperity and welfare of the nation, since the participating students will comprise the next generation of operations researchers capable of solving complex, large scale societal challenges.  The grant will support travel from the 2019 conference through the 2024 conference.\r\n\r\nThe INFORMS Annual Meeting is a leading North American conference for academics and practitioners who are addressing the challenges and opportunities in operations research. The conference draws widely from researchers in different domains and using different methods, and from primarily methods-driven research to primarily problem-driven research.  As participants, the graduate students will have a chance to present their work, attend the presentations of other scholars, and network with leading researchers in the field. The PI and governing committee will distribute the opportunity widely and have a fair and transparent selection process to identify candidates from underrepresented groups capable of high quality research who might not otherwise be able to attend the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
