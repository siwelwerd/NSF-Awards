Using targeted learning analytics, this project will bring to individual teachers in the classroom useful information about how their students are learning on the web. Rather on focusing on large-scale, state- or nationwide- analytics as is currently common in the research, the focus of this high-risk research is to develop analytics about individual students for use by individual teachers in the classroom. Armed with these analytics, teachers will be able to better understand the strengths and limitations of their individual students, especially as compared to their classroom. The project will create software and algorithms that will exploit the strengths of both teachers and computers by allowing teachers to focus on students, while computers to focus on information and analytics. The result: better, more useful information for teachers to help their students achieve their full potential. This research will help to fill a void that exists in the way teacher receive formative information about their students? online activity. Teachers are often blind to the actual online learning experience that is taking place, leading to missed educational opportunities and suboptimal education. This project will bridge this gap and create instructional methods and online activities that finally realize the promise offered by technology. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project is funding high-risk research that will lead to the development of software and algorithms that help teachers improve their instruction by providing them with actionable analytics about how their students are learning. Through the use of targeted online learning analytics, this project will bring to individual teachers in the classroom useful information about how their individual students are learning. Current research focuses on large-scale, state- or nationwide- analytics, which comes years too late and is too broad to be usable by individual teachers to help students. The focus of this high-risk research is to develop analytics about individual students for use by individual teachers in the classroom in real-time, and monitor progress of these analytics throughout the school year. Armed with these analytics, teachers will be able to better understand the strengths and limitations of their individual students, especially as compared to their classroom. Using machine learning and NLP, these new algorithms and processes will be able to better ascertain learning analytics such as student engagement, digital literacy, and off-task behavior, to list a few. The result: automatic, actionable analytics for teachers to assist students in achieving their full potential. This high-risk research will help to fill a void that exists in the ways teachers receive formative information about their students' online activity. Teachers are often blind to the actual online learning experience that is taking place. This project will bridge this gap and create instructional methods, online activities, and curriculum that finally realize the promise offered by technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

SBIR Phase 1 #1913555\n\nIn the past decade, school districts have invested in technical infrastructure in order to integrate innovative technologies to support teaching and learning. One-to-one (1:1) computing initiatives sought to provide all students with access to devices and the Internet.  Monitoring and filtering software were designed for the purpose of protecting and monitoring students as they accessed web content. The creation of the Learnics Insight Link, (LearnicsIL a chrome extension), was the first application, in our knowledge, that focused on what teachers and students could learn from student web logs. The LearnicsIL is unique in that it generates much of the same data as monitoring and filtering software, however, it collates this information into actionable data that is easily accessible by teachers and students.  You may remember when you had to not just get an answer for a math problem, you also had to show your work.  Well, in short, Learnics is the ?show me your work? company only for all subjects.\n\n \n\nThe NSF Phase I grant provided the opportunity to further develop the LearnicsIL.  The Learnics team were responsive to user feedback in order to create a tool that was easy to use for both teachers and students.  For example, additional data visualizations were integrated.  Eventually, the teacher dashboard became more streamlined.  Additional capabilities were added for teachers and students to download the raw data (.csv) and allowed teachers to review individual student data and share this data with students.\n\n \n\nThe student experience was also improved and a student page was developed which included simple start, pause, and submit log controls. Additionally, as teachers created assignments in Learnics, a unique link was generated that could be shared with students or added to an assignment within a learning management system. Additionally, students could view teacher-specified directions for the assignment, built-in instructions for how to use the Insight Link, and had easy access and completion of student feedback/reflection questions within the student portal.\n\n \n\nA concern for many teachers was the ability for LearnicsIL to integrate with Google Classroom.  A collaboration between the Learnics team and teachers has achieved this.  Also, a major problem we have encountered was a reliance on the student turning the Insight Link on and off.  Reports from classrooms suggested that students had all sorts of excuses why they did not turn on the LearnicsIL.  We just recently addressed this issue by creating a system whereby the Insight Link automatically turns on once a student starts an assignment.  When the student submits that assignment, in Google Classroom, their Insight Links are also automatically turned in.  In addition, as we continue to work with teachers, administrators, parents and students, we are exploring ways to make the analytics more meaningful to students and teachers. \n\n \n\nWe were also exploring unexpected avenues for future development.  How can the Insight Link be used to hold students accountable with respect to online learning?  How might the Insight Link be used to enhance teacher supervision/evaluation in a virtual environment? \n\n \n\nWhen the grant was originally awarded, our project was primarily aimed at K-12 school districts with one-to-one computer initiatives.  However, in the Spring, 2020, as the Co-vid Pandemic forced school districts to go entirely online, we realized our product has tremendous potential to impact the emerging virtual learning pedagogy in countless school districts across the country.  Thanks to Phase 1 funding, we were having a significant impact on how teachers, administrators, students and parents approach online learning. Online learning data was becoming visible and being used to improve the online teaching/learning process.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas Lare"
