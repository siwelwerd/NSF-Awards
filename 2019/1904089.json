 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will help characterize new ways in which cells control the flow of genetic information, particularly when responding to stress and to conserve energy. Chemical modifications of RNA, which are known to regulate gene expression, may be biased toward targeting certain genes over others due to specific sequences within the genetic code known as synonymous codons. The research will explore this phenomenon, which remains poorly understood thus far, especially in bacteria. The project will thus advance how gene expression regulation is at the frontier of genetics and biotechnological development. The project will also provide opportunities to train under-represented minority graduate and undergraduate students in cutting edge techniques in genetics and molecular biology. In addition, it will provide the scientific basis for outreach to faith-based communities through lectures at high school and divinity schools. \r\n\r\nThe genetic mechanisms used to quickly respond to cellular stressors are not completely understood. While transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators are thought to be primary effectors of cellular stress responses, recent studies suggest an emerging role for the epitranscriptome (RNA modifications) in the stress response toolbox. While it is clear that RNA modifications have an influence on stress response gene regulation, it is not clear how they target specific genes for regulation. The hypothesis addressed in this project is that synonymous leucine and serine codon bias provide a basis for epitranscriptomic targeting of stress response genes for regulatory purposes. This hypothesis will be tested by measuring expression of heat shock genes, with genetically engineered modified synonymous leucine or serine codon usage ratios, in the absence of specific tRNA modifications. Ribosome profiling in the absence of RNA modifications will also be performed to determine the sensitivity of specific codons to RNA modifications. The project will be a vehicle for training under-represented minority graduate and undergraduate students in cutting edge techniques in genetics and molecular biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
