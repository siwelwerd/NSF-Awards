 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor Kevin Williams from Western Kentucky University and colleagues Lester Pesterfield, Rui Zhang, Lawrence Hill and Yongming Deng have acquired a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with an automatic sampler. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as facilitating studies of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The NMR studies improve understanding of synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research. This broadly accessible instrumentation strengthens the regional NMR analytical infrastructure. Local high school students and teachers are participating in research activities. Training research students to operate a state-of-the-art NMR spectrometer is an integral part of institutional mission to perform student-centered, engaged research.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts exploration of the synthesis, reactivity, and biological activity of platinum(II) compounds that may be used as anticancer drugs and the development of methodologies for the synthesis of photocatalyzed alkynes reactions and biocompatible iron catalysts for carbene transfers. The NMR spectrometer is also used in studies that involve preparation of degradable polymers with antioxidant pendant groups and those using ionic liquid ligands for the synthesis of nanoparticle catalysts. In addition, it benefits the analysis and production of highly reactive metal-oxo species with molecular oxygen and visible light as oxidative catalysts. The spectrometer also serves researchers investigating hydrogen-deuterium exchange in cobalt(III) ammine complexes and correlating cobalt(III) chemical shifts with electronic transition energies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
