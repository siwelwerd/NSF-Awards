 "awd_abstract_narration": "The stability and durability of materials is a subject of fundamental importance that often decides whether a technology is viable, reliable and sustainable. Such considerations become amplified when applications require that materials operate at high temperatures. Plasmonics is a field of study that is powered by the ability to shape- and size-engineer metals at the nanoscale. The tendency for such structures to oxidize and morphologically reconfigure when heated can, however, disrupt or destroy properties that were so carefully engineered in the first place. With high-temperature plasmonics employed in a range of critical applications such as heat-assisted magnetic recording, high-temperature plasmonic sensing, and solar thermophotovoltaics, this deficiency puts at risk potentially disruptive technologies that are needed for data storage to the 'cloud' and the energy infrastructure of the U.S. This grant demonstrates that suitably fabricated plasmonic nanostructures, when encapsulated in an ultrathin oxide layer, maintain functionality while proving robust to high temperatures. Moreover, it shows that such structures can be fabricated over large areas using inexpensive and scalable nanofabrication techniques such as nanoimprint lithography. The availability of durable refractory plasmonics impacts data storage and energy industries and the nation?s economy and prosperity. In this project, undergraduate education is being integrated through research internships and outreach activities place emphasis on the matriculation of women and under-represented minority students into the engineering profession.\r\n\r\nWhile numerous high-temperature plasmonic applications exist, no single material has yet been identified that is able to maintain performance for long durations. This research aims to overcome this technological barrier through the use of a hybrid structure that combines the plasmonic properties of single-crystal nanostructures with an ultrathin cladding technology such that the combination yields a high-performance refractory plasmonic material. The projected solution is founded on an underlying hypothesis that single-crystal nanostructures are far more resistant to temperature-induced morphological changes than their polycrystalline counterparts. Moreover, if such nanostructures are encased in a refractory oxide, then the surface diffusion pathways, which are responsible for morphological reconfigurations, become blocked. The studies are divided into four thrust areas: (i) defining a robust and pinhole-free cladding technology, (ii) obtaining a mechanistic understanding of the cladding process and any failure modes and then advancing failure mitigation strategies, (iii) assessing and enhancing the capability of oxide claddings to resist chemical degradation, and (iv) devising processing routes that yield partially clad nanostructures which facilitate applications that require an exposed plasmonic surface. Together, this work provides a fundamental understanding of high-temperature diffusion processes that occur for clad metals and advances the processing science needed for manufacturing refractory plasmonic materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The award has resulted in six peer-reviewed publications including those in high impact factor journals (<em>Chemistry of Materials</em>, IF 10.51; <em>ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces</em>, IF 10.38; <em>Nano Research</em>, IF 10.27; <em>Nanoscale</em>, IF 8.31) as well as a comprehensive review article on the synthesis, assembly, and application of wafer-based noble metal nanoplates (<em>Journal of Materials Chemistry C</em><em>,</em> IF 8.07<em>)</em>. This work has been disseminated at national, international, and internal meetings including invited talks at conferences of the <em>Materials Research Society</em> (MRS), <em>European Materials Research Society</em> (E-MRS), and <em>International Conference on Metamaterials, Photonic Crystals and Plasmonics</em> (META). The work has resulted in the Ph.D. degrees of Trevor Demille, who is now employed by Intel, and Arin Preston, who is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Idaho National Laboratory. Specific research accomplishments include: (i) the first study to demonstrate the efficacy of ultrathin oxide films as a means to protect copper and silver nanostructures from oxidation and morphological degradation while operating in air, water, extreme pH environments, and at high temperatures, (ii) a new strategy for the nanofabrication of pinhole-free alumina coatings that allow for layers that are 50% thinner than those formed using conventional processes, (iii) the demonstration that coatings derived from alumina-hafnia oxide multilayers are far more resistant to pinhole formation upon heating because they frustrate crystallization processes that would otherwise act to degrade the coating at high temperatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Broader Impacts:</em></strong> Protective coatings are a pervasive and indispensable technology. Material stability, be it photo, thermal, chemical, mechanical, or a combination thereof, is a ubiquitous subject of fundamental importance. It often decides whether a technology is viable, reliable, and sustainable and where the outcomes have economic, environmental, and societal impacts. The findings demonstrated through the CMMI-1911991 Award are, therefore, of relevance to the multidisciplinary audience working with air- and temperature-sensitive nanomaterials. They also demonstrate a thin film deposition technique, referred to as atomic layer deposition (ALD), as a versatile platform for designing claddings that are responsive to the needs of specific applications. The PI has also had an impact as the lead organizer for the Spring 2021 Materials Research Society (MRS) virtual symposium entitled <em>Molecular and Colloidal Plasmonics ? Synthesis and Applications</em>. Highlights in terms of student training and mentorship include: (i) six undergraduate research internships where two students were female and another was of Hispanic heritage, (ii) graduate student mentoring for the <em>Advancing Women Leaders</em> <em>Program</em>, (iii) mentorship of three undergraduate students of color through the <em>Building Bridges Mentoring Program</em>, and (iv) mentorship of five high school students where four were female and two received the <em>1<sup>st</sup> Place Chemistry Award</em> at the 2020 Northern Indiana Regional Science &amp; Engineering Fair. Community engagement and outreach successes include: (i) the mentorship and judging of high school science fair projects and (ii) hosting a five hour per week, two semester research internship for a high school student.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/05/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Svetlana&nbsp;Neretina</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1911991/1911991_10609438_1659713127453_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1911991/1911991_10609438_1659713127453_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Unprotected and Protected Copper Nanostructures\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1911991/1911991_10609438_1659713127453_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Unprotected and Protected Copper Nanostructures\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
