 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies autonomous swarm systems, which consist of a large number of collaborating robots that work together with a few human supervisors. Such systems promise unmatched task parallelism, fault-tolerance, resilience, and keeping humans out of harm's way. However, there are important technical issues that stand in the way of realizing these promises. Specifically, there is a sizeable lack of understanding of how human supervisors (who provide tactical input and mission intent, as opposed to direct or indirect control) interact with embodied swarm intelligence. That understanding is imperative for identifying solutions to mitigating cognitive overload and preserving human-swarm trust and shared situation awareness, especially in humans-swarm teams that are actually scalable to practical applications. The researchers will leverage their engagement with particular stakeholder groups including the Buffalo Fire Department and Government/Industrial parties involved in Oil Spill Response. The project will also have impact on education, training, and broader research community through the development of curricular materials for AI and Robotics courses, multi-robotic workshops at pertinent conferences, and public dissemination of data and models.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will conduct a set of experiments and identify modeling approaches to answer fundamental questions regarding how humans respond to the behavior of embodied swarm agents. Those questions include how humans react to circumstantial or deliberate non-compliance by the swarm and the level of feedback provided by the swarm to explain any non-compliance, how humans identify and attribute errors (or perceived errors) to swarms, and how this impacts their intervention frequency. They will use a neuro-ergonomic approach to estimate human metrics such as event-related (brain) potential, intervention tendencies, situation awareness, and cognitive workload via physiological information. On the machine intelligence side, they will design decentralized swarm behavior to allow studying impact of unique factors such as non-compliance and feedback levels in search and object transport applications. The researchers have complementary expertise in the areas of human-robot interaction, human psycho-physiological monitoring, and autonomous swarm systems for engaging in the synergistic research activities that are central to the project. They also have access to key research facilities including a large motion capture environment, a swarmbot arena, aerial/ground swarm robotic platforms, brain-computer interfaces, and physiological monitoring setups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA large number of autonomous robots working alongside a few human teammates (aka human-swarm teams) to accomplish collective goals is expected to not only replace human-human teams in various societal applications ranging from logistics to agriculture but also form the cornerstone of the United States? disaster response and battlefield strategies. However, cooperation between the human operators and the swarm is affected by the level of artificial intelligence (AI) imparted to the robots. With the operator working remotely, their perception of the environment will be different from the AI perception leading to non-compliance of the AI agent. In this regard, sufficient information should be provided about the reason for non-compliance to keep the human operator aware of the situation at hand. Providing too much information and reasoning can quickly overwhelm the human while little feedback can impact his/her trust in the AI. The researchers in this project investigated the level of AI compliance, swarm size, and feedback level on human mental engagement, workload, and trust measured using psycho-physiological monitoring.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThe researchers developed a simulation environment for deploying 100s of autonomous robots to monitor a large environment and detect a target (e.g., oil spill). They conducted a series of experiments in which the robots would receive tactical commands from human operators and process the information from the environment to decide if the command should be followed. In case of non-compliance, the robots had three levels of feedback that they could utilize and provide evidence and potential alternative solutions to the human subjects. The brain activities of the subjects and their eye movements were recorded simultaneously. An extensive algorithm was developed to automatically remove artifacts from physiological data and extract cognitive information like mental workload, engagement, and situational awareness and relate them to the human-swarm situation and type of information that the human operator and AI were exchanging. Processing this information helped the researchers to develop a model for selecting the best level of feedback and reasoning for the AI to utilize for communication with human to optimize his/her level of situational awareness while keeping his/her cognitive workload in a manageable level. \n\n\n \n\n\nThe insights provided by this model are fundamental for establishing trustworthy interaction between humans and autonomous systems. The outcome of this project has been disseminated to research communities of interest and the public through 10 peer-reviewed journal and conference manuscripts that can be found on the National Science Foundation public access repository. Furthermore, the researchers of this study have publicly shared the multi-robot simulation environment (SHaSTA) that can be utilized by different researchers or the public to design and test new AI algorithm interacting with human subjects. This project provided partial funding and an opportunity to train 6 PhD students, 2 master students, and 1 undergraduate student.\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ehsan T Esfahani"
