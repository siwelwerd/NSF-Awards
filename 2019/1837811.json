While the individual effects have been known, little has been done to account for their joint effects during the complete course of a convective process. Fully understanding and accounting for these joint effects is key for both climate and weather applications. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe following research will be carried out in this project:\r\n- Validation and application of novel research products;\r\n- Quantification of aerosol-induced changes in radiative heating and latent heat release associated with cloud condensation and freezing;\r\n- Gaining deeper insights into the effects of API, ARI, and ACI from the perspective of their joint influences;\r\n- Enhanced capability in simulating the various complex processes of boundary-layer and convective-cloud processes.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nWeather and climate models have systematic biases in rainfall simulations both in magnitude and timing associated with convective clouds: often overestimation and underestimation of light and heavy rainfall, respectively.  While the individual impacts of aerosols on the development of PBL, shallow boundary-layer clouds, and deep convective clouds have been tackled, a systematic study here is likely to lessen, if not solve, the problem. The study is also helpful in understanding and forecasting air pollution by accounting for the feedback between aerosols and the PBL, and severe weather events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A New Method of Determining the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) Height (Su et al., 2019)</span></em></strong></h3>\n<p>Planetary boundary layer (PBL) processes play key roles in the initiation of convection and boundary-layer low clouds. Given the rapid change in the PBL over land, radiosondes cannot track the diurnal development of the PBL. We have developed a state-of-the-art automatic determination of PBL height using the combination of ground-based lidar (e.g., the MPL) and radiosonde data. While lidar-based backscatter profiles have been used to track the development of the PBL at high temporal and vertical resolutions, the previous approaches are only valid for well-mixed aerosol structures inside the PBL that change in harmony with the evolution of atmospheric thermodynamics. Its validity of application depends on atmospheric stability, and if there is any residual aerosol layer. If the latter is decoupled with the PBL, the approach is no longer applicable. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a novel method that can track diurnal variations of PBLH more accurately&nbsp; (Su et al., 2019).</p>\n<p><strong><em>3.

Aerosol structures can be largely classified into three types: well-mixed, decreasing with height, and inverse structures. The aerosol-PBL relationship and diurnal cycles of the PBL height and PM<sub>2.5 </sub>associated with these<sub> </sub>different aerosol vertical structures show distinct characteristics. The vertical distribution of aerosol radiative forcing differs drastically among the three types with strong heating in the lower, middle, and upper PBL, respectively. Such a discrepancy in heating rate affects the atmospheric buoyancy and stability differently in the three distinct aerosol structures. Absorbing aerosols have a weak effect on stabilizing the lower atmosphere for the decreasing structure than for the inverse structure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>5.

In recent years, aerosol effects on deep convection have garnered much attention. Our study led to a discovery that aerosols over the heavily polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain, located within the Asian monsoon domain, not only stabilize the lower atmosphere but in a seemingly contradictory way also favor deep convection due to a seminal role of aerosols in increasing the moist static energy through enhancement of internal energy. Although a heavy loading of absorbing aerosols might stabilize the planetary boundary layer and weaken the convection, observational analyses highlight the seminal role played by aerosols in increasing moist static energy, thus increasing the convective potential of the lower atmosphere. This leads to regional dynamical changes that trigger greater moisture feedback and regional precipitation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><br /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/31/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zhanqing&nbsp;Li</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1837811/1837811_10587425_1672472394521_Screenshot2022-12-31at3.38.25PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1837811/1837811_10587425_1672472394521_Screenshot2022-12-31at3.38.25PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1837811/1837811_10587425_1672472394521_Screenshot2022-12-31at3.38.25PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic view of major deep convective cloud microphysical processes and their interactions with dynamic processes, and aerosol serving as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nucleating particles (INP), from  Fan and Li (2022, a book chapter).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Su et al.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zhanqing&nbsp;Li</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1837811/1837811_10587425_1672472515521_Screenshot2022-12-31at3.40.24PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1837811/1837811_10587425_1672472515521_Screenshot2022-12-31at3.40.24PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1837811/1837811_10587425_1672472515521_Screenshot2022-12-31at3.40.24PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Evolution of the PBL height under different atmospheric stability conditions: (a) stable, (b) neutral, and (c) convective boundary layer cases.

Expanding on the idea for determining cloud coupling over oceans, an attempt was made to generalize the concept of coupling and decoupling of low clouds over land based on potential temperature profiles. Using ample measurements from the lidar and a suite of surface meteorological instruments installed at the ARM program's Southern Great Plains site, the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and coupled states under cloudy conditions during the daytime were simultaneously retrieved. The new lidar-based method relies on the PBLH, the lifted condensation level, and the cloud base height to diagnose the cloud coupling.
