 "awd_abstract_narration": "Present-day Earth is the product of an evolutionary process which began with a largely or completely molten planet. This project aims to constrain the iron contents of solid and liquid phases in the early magma ocean. Whether solids rise or sink in a magma depends on their density contrast with the liquid, which is a function of their relative iron contents. The distribution of iron between phases is called partitioning. Quantifying iron partitioning in the early magma ocean is critical to model Earth's mantle evolution toward its present-day structure and composition. Here, the researcher uses computational physics to model at the atomic level the chemistry of iron in the magma. The simulation - called \"ab initio\" because it relies on quantum-mechanics first principles - accounts for the extreme pressures prevailing in the deep magma ocean. The team's state-of-the-art code includes developments which allow calculating the affinity of iron with solid and liquid phases, thus whether minerals rise or sink. This project promotes the training of a graduate student in computational Mineral Physics. It impacts the adjacent fields of Experimental Petrology and Geodynamics, with strong implications for the interpretation of modern geochemical and seismological observations. It also has broad impacts in Materials Science. \r\n\r\nPrevious work has shown that whether crystals rise or sink in a magma ocean depends critically on the partitioning of iron between liquid and crystalline phases. Yet, the sign of the liquid-crystal density contrast and the vector of geochemical evolution is unknown at the conditions of the deep magma ocean. Here, the PI and his team calculates ab initio the partitioning of iron among coexisting phases throughout the pressure regime of the lower mantle. The project represents a major expansion for the application of density functional theory to the magma ocean. It encompasses studies of end-member compositions and the chemical interaction between liquids and crystals. The team build on their accomplishments in ab initio simulation of Earth's iron-bearing systems - including strong correlation and magnetic entropy - by broadening the scope to account for free energies and element partitioning. Using first principles molecular dynamics coupled with adiabatic switching, they will predict iron partitioning between: 1) liquid and crystalline (Mg,Fe)O , 2) liquid and crystalline (Mg,Fe)SiO3 and 3) a liquid approximating bulk silicate Earth composition and (Mg,Fe)O ferropericlase and (Mg,Fe)SiO3 bridgmanite.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Earth may have begun in a completely molten state, a magma ocean, which, as it cooled and crystallized, set the stage for our present Earth.  As crystals froze out of the magma ocean: did they float or sink in the surrounding magma?  This turns out to be one of the most important questions linking our ideas about the early magma ocean to today?s Earth, because it sets the vector of geochemical evolution.  \n\nOur major finding is that crystals freezing from the magma ocean float.  This finding has major implications for our understanding of the early Earth.  Crystal flotation stabilizes a so-called basal magma ocean at the very base of the mantle.  While the basal magma ocean is completely frozen today, it may have survived for billions of years, affecting dynamics and geochemistry, and may have been the source of Earth?s earliest magnetic field.  \n\nThe key to understanding crystal flotation is the behavior of iron.  As the crystal forms, is iron enriched or excluded.  Because iron is so heavy the answer determines whether crystal float or sink.  We characterize the distribution of iron between liquid and crystal with a partition coefficient, related to the concentration of iron in the crystal divided by that in the liquid.  We find that the partition coefficient is very small at the conditions of the deep magma ocean, which means that iron is excluded from the crystals, causing them to float.\n\nThe process by which the magma ocean freezes is complicated by the fact that we have to consider at least two different types of crystals: ferropericlase (a Mg,Fe oxide) and bridgmanite (a Mg,Fe silicate).  In ferropericlase, the partition coefficient decreases rapidly with increasing pressure, up to about 80 GPa, where it reaches a very small value (0.1) indicating very strong exclusion of iron from the crystal.  We found that at high pressure, the partition coefficient increases again.  We found that this intriguing behavior was related to a change in the state of the iron atom.  At low pressure, iron is in a high-spin state with many unpaired electrons and a large magnetic moment.  At high pressure, iron adopts a low-spin state, with completely paired electrons and no magnetic moment.  This transition from high-spin to low-spin we found, accounts for the non-monotonic variation of the partition coefficient with increasing pressure.\n\nBridgmanite is even more important because 1) it is the first to crystallize and 2) it is the most abundant mineral in the Earth.  Here we found the iron remains high-spin and that the partition coefficient decreases smoothly with increasing pressure, reaching values as small as 0.2.\n\nOur work has had broader impact through improvements to our thermodynamics code HeFESTo, which we have improved and updated based on results of this proposal.  We make HeFESTo publicly available, and it has been used by scientists in a number of disciplines, including seismology, geodynamics, and geochemistry, to learn more about Earth?s mantle and its evolution over geologic time.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/03/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lars P Stixrude"
