The conference will be held between August 11-16, 2019 in the Colby-Sawyer College in New Hampshire. Preference will be given to supporting graduate students and postdocs. This is a long-running conference that brings together a diverse group of scientists from the broad spectrum of areas covering soft-matter physics. The conference has a substantial mentoring component as the main event is preceded by a two-day Gordon Research Seminar. The conference is expected to lead to fruitful collaborations and new insights on both theoretical as well as on experimental efforts in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
