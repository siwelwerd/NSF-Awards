 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by implementing educational simulations to improve career preparation among STEM students. There is a shortage of qualified workers in many STEM careers, including cybersecurity and data science. Although undergraduate education is a key step along the career pipeline, in-depth experiences such as internships often come too late and are challenging to scale up to large numbers of students whose skills are still developing. There is a need for authentic, scalable learning experiences that expose undergraduates to professional STEM practices. This project will examine how educational simulations can help undergraduate students understand and engage with STEM careers in a realistic and interdisciplinary context. The project aims to enhance the career awareness and skills of students in two areas of national interest: cybersecurity and crisis response. The project also aims to generate knowledge about how simulations can be used synergistically with traditional courses. The outcomes of the project have potential impact across the higher education spectrum and the K-12 environment. \r\n\r\nThis project will use a new form of educational simulation called a Playable Case Study (PCS). In a PCS, players collaborate with each other and fictional characters in an authentic scenario using a multimedia interface supported by chatbots, videoconferencing, and interactive STEM tools. Players' actions and decisions influence the unfolding narrative. The PCS will spawn in-class discussions to help students reflect on and gain more disciplinary understanding from their experience. Like other educational simulations, PCSs provide undergraduate students with a low-risk opportunity to experience professional STEM work that can be scaled up through technology to reach more students. The project will create and evaluate two PCSs focused on human-centered cybersecurity and crisis response. It will use a socio-cognitive approach, called expansive framing. Students will have the opportunity take ownership of their learning by framing problems in their own words. The project will combine design-based research and quasi-experimentation to answer three research questions: 1) How do PCSs support STEM learning, engagement, career awareness, and career intent; and how does this vary for different kinds of students? 2) How can a situated learning simulation (e.g., PCSs) be augmented by expansive framing to increase near and far transfer of STEM knowledge? 3) How can a simulation with an analytics engine and embedded assessments present meaningful student feedback about their interdisciplinary, team-based STEM work? The results of this project have the potential to improve STEM career pathways and will enhance understanding of how simulation can be effectively used in educational environments. This Engaged Student Learning project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources (IUSE: EHR), which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all undergraduate students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Playable Case Studies are highly realistic and immersive simulations wherein players take on the role of a professional. This project explored the design challenges and opportunities of running role-based simulations wherein students work together to solve authentic problems based on unique information and player actions, helping students realize the importance of collaboration. Playable case studies are explicitly designed to help students envision themselves in STEM careers by enacting those roles in a simplified, yet authentic environment. This project supported the development of a simulation authoring platform that has been used to develop Playable Case Studies related to municipal cybersecurity defense, cybersecurity pen testing, user experience design, Spanish language learning, museum studies, and technical writing. These simulations have been used by dozens of teachers and thousands of students in formal and informal undergraduate and high school settings. The project team&rsquo;s educator evaluation workshops, conducted with several undergraduate educators from multiple institutions in Utah, California, and Maryland, earned high marks and resulted in design insights that the team is incorporating into the simulation architecture&rsquo;s teacher dashboard and instructional resources.

The team also published on design techniques for embedding ethical dilemmas into simulations in authentic ways that allow students to learn from ethical failures. Additional work describes the characteristics of the design process that lead to highly engaging and authentic simulations, as well as the design tensions that exist when trying to develop simplifications of reality, while also maintaining authenticity. Finally, several studies describe different design mechanics and interface elements that enhance authenticity. Evaluation research has shown that participants of Playable Case Studies find them highly engaging, influence their understanding of and interest in STEM careers, and better appreciate professional skills such as writing and ethics in fields such as cybersecurity, where those are not often recognized as important by newcomers to the field.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Another strand of research emerged as this project was underway.

Playable case studies, our core starting innovation, are explicitly rooted in modern socio-constructivist learning theory.

A central goal of our project was extending this innovation using design principles for &ldquo;expansive framing.&rdquo; These principles are rooted in newer situative learning theories. The principles suggest framing learning from a &ldquo;personally authentic&rdquo; perspective. As argued in a 2021 National Academy report on teaching computing to diverse young people, professional authentic experiences are likely unwelcoming to many minoritized learners compared to personally authentic experiences.&nbsp; However, both PCSs struggled to enact expansively framed/personally authentic features. This finding led us to conclude that (a) the expansive framing design principles are complex and difficult to enact, (b) personal authenticity is likely an easier way to understand and accomplish these goals, and (c) it is likely more effective to start with personally authentic contexts and gradually transition to professional authentic context.
