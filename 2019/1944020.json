 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical paragraph:  Every habitat on earth host its own microbiome, which can include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protists.  Recognition of the diversity and complexity of microbial communities that colonize humans, plants, animals, soil, and water has changed in fundamental ways how we think about the relationships between big and small organisms, as well as our basic understanding of disease, health, and immunity.  Collectively, there is widespread recognition of the significant roles that microbiomes play in organismal and ecosystem health and functioning, and significant incentives to harness this potential.  Private investments in microbiome research have expanded dramatically over the past decade, with hundreds of companies focusing on the potential manipulation or management of microbiomes in human and animal medicine and in agriculture.  Despite the expanding research footprint, there have been remarkably few deliberate efforts to engage researchers across the breadth of microbiome science in discussions of key resource needs?conceptual, technical, or analytical?to support cross-cutting advances.  The project will support a workshop bringing together 60+ scientists in person, plus another 100+ scientists virtually, including researchers working on plant, animal, environmental, and human microbiomes.  Participants will use ecology and evolutionary biology as an integrating framework, as they provide a powerful context for integrative, cross-discipline discussion.  Small-group and interactive sessions will stimulate researchers to identify key resource and knowledge gaps across microbiome science, conceptual and theoretical foundations that can advance hypothesis testing, big ideas to drive advances in microbiome applications, and a path forward for collaborative research and synthetic analyses.  \r\n\r\nTechnical paragraph:  Significant technical innovations have propelled exponential increases in the volume of microbiome data generated over the past decade.  Yet development of conceptual, theoretical, and practical infrastructure to advance our collective understanding of microbiomes lags behind.  Microbiome research suffers from a lack of reliance on explicit conceptual frameworks for ecological and evolutionary hypothesis testing, and there have been few attempts to develop generalizable models for microbiome community dynamics or assembly.  Moreover, fragmentation of research efforts across systems (animal, human, plant, environmental), and even among researchers using different approaches to study the same system, has restricted opportunities to identify common principles of microbiome structure or organization.  This workshop will address these gaps, targeting 4 objectives:  1. Explore cross-cutting themes and key challenges in microbiome science; 2. Facilitate advances in the development of rigorous ecological foundations and hypothesis-testing within microbiome research; 3. Stimulate the search for generalizable concepts, principles, and language for microbiome assembly and functions; 4. Identify key cross-community knowledge and resource gaps and opportunities for advancing the field.  The workshop will provide significant opportunities for cross-disciplinary scientific interactions to advance the microbiome research community.  Early-career post-doctoral scientists will be enlisted to serve as virtual discussion leads, providing an opportunity to develop skills in distance communication to support new models for scientific meetings and education.  Collectively, this workshop will identify critical gaps in resources and understanding of microbiomes across disciplines, and stimulate community-wide, collaborative efforts to address these key resource and knowledge gaps.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMicrobiomes, or the microbes (bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protists) inhabiting humans, plants, animals, and our environment, play significant roles in the health of organisms and the ecosystem.  However, despite advances in our understanding of the roles that microbiomes play in organismal and ecosystem functioning, gaps remain.  In particular, extensive fragmentation of research efforts across systems, and among researchers using different approaches to study the same system, has constrained identification of common principles of microbiome structure and organization. We sought to address these gaps by convening scientists to advance cross-disciplinary conceptual, theoretical, and practical infrastructure in microbiome science.  This project provided funds to support a 2.5-day hybrid in-person/virtual workshop to address critical gaps in microbiome science. \n\n \n\nProject Outputs: \n\n1.  We delivered a highly successful workshop in December, 2019 (pre-COVID), engaging 65+ participants in person and ~ 400 virtual participants from more than 25 different countries.  Short presentations and small and large-group discussions targeted 5 cross-disciplinary topics:  a) Ecological theory to advance understanding and cross-system analyses; b) Roles of species and chemical interactions in mediating microbiome functional dynamics; c) Synthetic microbiomes and model systems to advance microbiome experimentation; d) Analytical advances to enhance insights; and e) Big ideas:  where does the future take us? \n\nThe workshop featured brief talks (19 speakers) from predominantly early-career scientists to highlight innovative findings, technical approaches, novel analyses, and the broad state of the science.  These served as a springboard for structured discussions incorporating both in-person and virtual participants. \n\n2.  We developed and utilized a multi-platform model for communicating among in-person and virtual participants.  We created a hybrid virtual/in-person meeting structure to enhance opportunities for participation and real-time interactions among all registered attendees.  Specifically, we used Zoom to broadcast audio and video from the meeting and during discussion sessions.  We used Twitter for outreach beyond our meeting, and Slack to support both conference-wide questions and discussion as well as small-group discussions (30+ Slack channels during the meeting).  Training in all platforms was offered before and during the meeting by our technical support team.  The use of multiple overlapping participation modalities and communication technologies, as well as the creation and active moderation of virtual communities of remote participants (see below) enhanced our success.\n\n3.  We created a novel `virtual community? approach to engaging virtual participants.  To enrich the virtual experience, we developed `virtual communities? (VC) of scholars in advance of the meetings.  The individual VCs served as discussion groups throughout the meetings, and offered remote participants a structured setting within which to get to know and interact with scientists from other institutions and disciplines.  To create the VCs, we surveyed all participants during pre-registration.  We used this information to compose VCs that cut across disciplines, locations, and career stages.  Every VC was led by a trained moderator; we advertised and offered a small stipend for advanced graduate student and post-doctoral scientists to serve as VC moderators.  All 27 VCs (6-14 participants in each VC) were able communicated within their group throughout the meeting via their own dedicated Slack channels, and engaged with one another via Zoom both before and during the meeting.  Finally, all VC members participated fully in the large-group meeting sessions via Zoom and Slack interfaces.\n\n3.  We published a summary paper on the meeting structure (Fulcher et al., 2020). \n\n4. We stimulated diverse cross-disciplinary discussions and interactions on the future of microbiome science, culminating in a special mSystems issue of pieces on ?Deciphering the Microbiomes?.  Post-meeting, we issued a call for submissions to a special mSystems collection on ?Deciphering the Microbiome? (see attached call).  We solicited 250-word proposals for co-authored pieces of up to 1500 words.  Co-author teams were required to include at least 3 disciplines to establish interdisciplinarity, and to include a majority early career scientists.  We received 43 proposals that included over 250 predominantly early-career authors.  We selected 10 of these for inclusion in the final mSystems special edition.  The full collection will be published by the end of 2021, including an introductory piece by the meeting Co-Organizers. \n\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT:  Our workshop brought together a diverse group of microbiome scientists to advance cross-disciplinary thinking and ecological hypothesis-testing in microbiome science.  The workshop stimulated novel cross-disciplinary interactions among scientists, culminating in the submission of 43 proposals for full-length interdisciplinary publications.  There have been multiple requests for a repeat of the workshop to further these discussions, which may be considered in the future. \n\nBROADER IMPACTS:  The workshop provided significant opportunities for cross-disciplinary interactions, and for early-career scientists as speakers, VC leaders, and manuscript authors in the mSystems special issue.  In addition, we developed a novel VC model to support highly-interactive remote meeting participation.  Finally, we supported participation of underrepresented groups in microbiome research via deliberate strategies for inclusion as invited speakers, and outreach to underrepresented groups for virtual participation.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Linda L Kinkel"
