 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1\r\nThe University of Hawai'i at Manoa GP-IMPACT project EPIK (Earth, Planets, 'Ike, and Kuleana) seeks to diversify and broaden participation in the geosciences by developing a transformative pre-college pathway to recruit, retain, and prepare the next generation of diverse geoscientists, with a particular emphasis on Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPI). EPIK has three primary objectives: 1) Develop a strategic partnership between Hawai'i's Native-Hawaiian-serving high schools and the University of  Hawai'i to increase participation of underrepresented groups in, and awareness of, the geosciences; 2) Create a well-defined pathway for Hawai'i high school students  to UHM undergraduate programs in geoscience, reinforced by timely mentoring and access to pre-college coursework; 3) Broaden the perspective of Hawai'i's youth as to the role and significance of geoscience careers within their community, emphasized by the value of indigenous 'ike (knowledge) and the Native Hawaiian regard for kuleana (responsibility) of the Earth.  EPIK will provide inquiry- and place-based learning experiences, at both local high school campuses and at UHM, that aim to develop science and technology skills for Hawai'i's emerging geoscience students. EPIK educational programs will aim to expose students and teachers to a robust introduction of practical Earth science concepts, including those that address Hawai'i's geologic and environmental challenges, connect with Native Hawaiian culture and traditions, and enhance students? desires to pursue careers in geoscience that are critical for working toward a sustainable future for Hawai'i.\r\n\r\nPart 2  \r\nEPIK's long-term mission will be to establish a thriving educational pathway for Hawai'i's emerging Earth science stewards. Four synergistic EPIK components will be established to accomplish these goals: 1) EPIK-Net: a geoscience network of Hawai'i  high school teachers and UHM students, faculty, and supporting personnel who will work collaboratively toward the common goal of increasing NHPI participation in the geosciences by raising awareness about the geosciences as a viable career path and providing mentoring to interested students; 2) EPIK-Day: a collection of innovative, succinct, and mobile educational sessions conforming to high school science standards for visiting school groups on the UHM campus, or transported to high school campuses upon request; 3) EPIK-Summer: a 2-week summer camp comprised of inquiry- and place-based workshops and field trips to unique geologic settings, serving both high school student participants and Hawai'i  teachers from Native-Hawaiian-serving schools; 4) EPIK-Scholar: a pathway for high school students to earn college course credit and tuition scholarships for Earth Science courses offered through the UHM Summer Scholar program. Moreover, a major emphasis of the EPIK program will be to strategically integrate geoscience place-based 'ike (knowledge) with the Native Hawaiian regard for kuleana (responsibility) to promote awareness and expertise in geoscience-related fields that support a thriving yet sustainable community for Hawai'i.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
