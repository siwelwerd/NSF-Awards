This project seeks to explore the characteristics of STEM New Orleans Louisiana (NOLA), a community-based program targeting underrepresented K-12 students. The project will provide insights into a model of STEM learning to investigate issues of equity, accessibility and broadening participation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
