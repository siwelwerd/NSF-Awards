 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project brings together scientists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the University of Pennsylvania to gain new understanding of how mechanical properties, like stiffness and strength, change when a polymeric material is made into a film with thickness near the size of an individual molecule.  Ultra-thin films, such as the ones studied in this project, are desired to help decrease energy consumption in processes like filtration, as well as in semiconductor manufacturing.  However, current materials are unable to provide sufficient strength in these applications.  New experimental methods will be combined with molecular simulations to understand how structures in the polymer thin films affect their properties in these highly confined states.  Beyond the broad impact related to the development of new fundamental science and materials-design guidelines that will decrease materials waste and increase energy efficiency, this project will provide new opportunities for educating Ph.D. students, undergraduate students, and high-school students through rich, collaborative research experiences involving both experiments and simulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project will provide new fundamental data and knowledge on the role of block copolymer domain structure in controlling the full mechanical response of ultra-thin polymer films, where film thickness is comparable to or smaller than the domain structure size scale. The proposed approach unites the strengths of advanced simulations and novel experimental methods to test new hypotheses based on the role of position within a confined material on segmental mobility and inter-chain entanglements, and the consequential impact on mechanical properties. Experimentally, a recent mechanical measurement method, called The Uniaxial Tensile Tester for Ultra-Thin films (TUTTUT), will be used to quantify the mechanics of ultra-thin block copolymer films. The experiments will integrate with simulations that use coarse-grained models to predict the molecular response of polymer films, and the simulations will provide a local picture of the changes in the entanglement network and local dynamics as a function of position away from the interfaces in the block copolymer films. Through these efforts, the co-PIs will support the education, training, and inspiration of the next generation of materials scientists and engineers, with a focus toward increased participation of women and traditionally under-represented minorities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We began this study by first understanding failure in homopolymer thin films by quantifying the strength (maximum stress before failure) or the toughness (energy dissipated before failure), which are key material properties in applications. Specifically, since polymer entanglements are thought to be essential for the toughness of polymers, we systematically varied the entanglement density by diluting highly entangled polymers with low molecular weight polymers of identical backbone chemistry and measured the toughness of these systems (see Figure 1). By comparing the measured strength in experiments or toughness in simulations to classic theoretical models, we found that the models were unable to describe our data. When we took a microscopic view of our simulations, we found that the stress in the polymer backbones was strongly heterogeneous, and that entanglements far from chain ends still would not carry significant stress if their partner entanglement involved a chain end. This finding qualitatively changes the dependence of the toughness on the entanglement density, which was reflected in both the experimental and computational results (see Figure 2).</p>\n<p>This study was followed up by two studies that focused on understanding the effects of nanoscale confinement and changes in entanglement density on the failure properties of polymer glass thin films. First, in a purely computational study, we extended the above work by varying the film thickness at a variety of diluent concentrations. We hypothesized that there would be competing effects ductility of polymers due to confinement effects enhancing segmental dynamics, promoting ductility, while the entanglements would be diluted, reducing ductility. We found that as a function of film thickness there was a sharp cross-over in behavior, where the dependence of the toughness changed from an exponential dependence on the number of effective entanglements to a linear one, see Figure 3. We speculate that this cross-over is where the behavior qualitatively changes to acting more like a polymer melt at sufficiently thin films. This study was followed up by a combined experiment and simulation work where we developed an empirical model to capture the trends in the toughness/strength of polymer films at various film thicknesses and effective number of entanglements per chain.</p>\n<p>The final study from this effort focused not on homopolymers but rather on confinement effects on the failure properties of glassy block copolymers films. In this effort, we focused solely on lamellar-forming, free-standing block copolymer thin films, and we investigated the role of chain length, lamellar-domain orientation, and film thickness on the failure properties. In thin films containing oriented lamellae, the failure mode occurred in two stages. Initially, small holes would form near the lamellar interface before transitioning to the center of either the A or B domain (see Figure 4). The ultimate failure would occur in the center due to the relatively higher concentration of chain ends. We found that the ordered block copolymers exhibited substantially less toughness than the equivalent homopolymer films at the same entanglement density (see Figure 5), presumably due to the concentration of chain ends built into the lamellar morphology.</p>\n<p>In total, this combined experimental and computational project has provided new, fundamental insights into the role of polymer entanglements in the failure of glassy polymers. While it has long been known that chain ends alone cannot carry load, their role as a possible &ldquo;entanglement partner&rdquo; had been neglected. By modifying the model for strength/toughness by Mikos and Peppas, we have significantly improved its predictive power. In addition, this study has been the first to show how failure in glassy block copolymers compares to that of neat homopolymers, showing in particular that well-ordered block copolymer films are significantly less tough than a homopolymer film with comparable entanglement density. These results are expected to significantly improve our ability to anticipate the properties of polymer and block copolymer films, both of which are commonly used in numerous applications that span from polymer membranes to masks for nanolithography.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/08/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robert&nbsp;A&nbsp;Riggleman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904776/1904776_10612631_1675869616047_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904776/1904776_10612631_1675869616047_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1904776/1904776_10612631_1675869616047_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(top left) Image of experimental apparatus for tensile testing thin polymer films.
