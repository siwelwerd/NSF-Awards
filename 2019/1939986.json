 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical:\r\n\r\nThermoelectric devices hold great promise for the future energy landscape. They convert waste heat into usable electricity and can provide on demand cooling or heating. Despite their potential, the low efficiency of thermoelectric devices has limited their adoption. Advances in the properties of materials used in thermoelectric devices are needed to make this promising technology a reality. The PIs will investigate a new family of materials for thermoelectric applications: hybrid metal halide perovskites with organic and inorganic components. Students will receive training in materials science and engineering. This project will impact the materials science and electronics communities and inspire future scientists and engineers dedicated to sustainable energy solutions.\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\nHybrid metal halide perovskites are low-thermal conductivity materials with clear benefits in practical, solution-processed thermoelectric devices from a performance and cost basis. Yet, little effort has been placed in fabricating thermoelectric devices from perovskite systems. This lack of study and implementation is mainly due to the key challenge in finding a means by which to effectively control the charge carrier concentration and electrical conductivity of the devices through straightforward doping strategies. The conventional approach to doping that is focused on atomic substitution in the lattice does not work for halide perovskites due to charge screening and the defect-tolerant nature of typical perovskite systems. Therefore, a shift in archetype regarding doping in perovskite devices must be had in order to overcome this key challenge. This critical opportunity will be addressed by incorporating radical-containing ligands into the actual perovskite crystal lattice in order to serve as intramolecular dopants for the thermoelectric devices. This project is based on the PIs' prior work in manipulating the optoelectronic properties of perovskite-based devices by incorporating closed-shell organic ligands into the crystal structures of the materials and previous success of using radical-based dopants to enhance the performance of polymer thermoelectric devices. Inclusion of these radical dopants will allow for the ready tuning of the carrier concentrations and electrical and thermal conductivities associated with the semiconducting materials through intramolecular means. This project will enable manipulation of the key structure-property-performance relationships in a novel class of printed electronic materials, and in doing so, demonstrate high-performance devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Despite the numerous upsides and large potential for transformative impact, thermoelectric devices have not reached widespread application because of their relatively low conversion efficiencies (i.e., less than 10% of the Carnot cycle efficiency). In particular, the largest hurdle in achieving higher energy conversion for thermoelectric devices fabricated from traditional materials lies in the fact that the material figure of merit (<em>zT</em>), which determines the upper limit of device efficiency for modules fabricated from these materials, is tied to inherently-linked parameters. Importantly, for most common materials, there is a necessary tradeoff between improving one of these parameters versus another parameter; thus, there is a delicate balancing act that must be performed. In turn, this limits the ultimate performance that can be achieved by the current generation of materials systems. Here, we aimed to overcome this inherent materials limitation through the application of an emerging set of inorganic-organic hybrid materials.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Specifically, we introduced halide perovskites as next-generation thermoelectric materials. Recently, halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention due to striking features being discovered in these electronically-active materials. These features include: (1) long charge carrier diffusion lengths and lifetimes; (2) relatively large charge carrier mobility values; (3) large light absorption coefficients; (4) and intense photoluminescence. In a manner that is different from conventional semiconductors, the crystal lattice of halide perovskites is ?soft?, and it allows for facile structural and compositional tuning at low temperatures under mild conditions. Thus, we were confident that these materials would enable us to overcome the inherent limitations of current materials. To achieve this objective, we created lead-free hybrid perovskite materials with inorganic materials (e.g., tin-based systems) as the matrix material and electronically-active ligands as the spacing materials between the inorganic layers (Figure 1). In this way, we were able to alter the structural, optical, and thermoelectric properties of the materials in a ready manner. That is, by tuning the input materials and the nucleation and growth conditions associated with the perovskite synthesis, we were able to realize hybrid perovskite systems that had superior properties relative to the current state of the art. Moreover, the soft lattices of the hybrid perovskites allowed for facile extrinsic (i.e., intentional) doping of the designer materials. In turn, this allowed for expediated tuning of the carrier concentrations within the doped perovskite layers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Importantly, we utilized two-dimensional (2D) perovskite architectures as our team has established that 2D perovskites that have electronically-active organic ligands have superior electronic properties and superior stability properties relative to three-dimensional (3D) perovskite structures and perovskite structures that utilize electronically-inactive organic ligands. With these molecular design protocols in hand, over the course of this 1-year project, we were able to generate next-generation 2D perovskites with world-record charge carrier mobility values (Figure 2) and thermoelectric performance. Moreover, due to the thin and soft nature of these materials, we were able to fabricate devices on polymeric substrates, which allowed the devices to be flexible in nature (Figure 3). In doing so, we see a clear means by which to eventually translate this work from the benchtop and into practical energy conversion applications. Thus, this work should have impact both from a fundamental science perspective, and we anticipate that it will also be of utility in moving industrial efforts forward in this important avenue of emerging energy conversion systems as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to making these Intellectual Merit impacts, the work performed in this proposal also made significant inroads with respect to Broader Impacts as well. First, a visiting female undergraduate student from the country of Colombia and a graduate student at Purdue University participated directly in this project in summer and fall of 2019, and they were able to work together during the time that the Colombian student was at Purdue University. This allowed the two students from different cultures to interact with one another, and they were able to do so successfully to produce excellent scientific results. Moreover, the undergraduate student was able to present her results in oral form at a university-wide colloquium, and she demonstrated her excellent science communication skills. Finally, we expect that the results of this work should be translatable to practice in a rather direct manner due to the scalable manufacturing processes used to generate the thermoelectric materials and devices of this effort. Therefore, this work has made an impact both inside and outside the walls of Purdue University.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/09/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Letian&nbsp;Dou</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1939986/1939986_10621727_1599615733931_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1939986/1939986_10621727_1599615733931_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1939986/1939986_10621727_1599615733931_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Structural illustration of the 2D organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskites.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Letian Dou</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Letian&nbsp;Dou</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1939986/1939986_10621727_1599615787475_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1939986/1939986_10621727_1599615787475_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1939986/1939986_10621727_1599615787475_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Field effect transistors based on the 2D perovskites.
