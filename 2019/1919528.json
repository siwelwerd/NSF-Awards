 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award supports the acquisition of a state-of-the-art atomic force microscope (AFM) at Gonzaga University, which provides the ability to accurately measure nanoscale features, deformations and forces, as well as surface chemical and mechanical properties. These capabilities enable fundamental scientific investigations in a myriad of multi-disciplinary research areas at Gonzaga, which include tip-based nanoscale additive manufacturing, nanoscale tribology and materials science, biological imaging and organismal biomechanics. The knowledge generated from this research could catalyze development of novel advanced nanostructured materials and new nanoscale manufacturing methods for sensors and devices. Research on biophysical macromolecular interactions could lead to a new understanding of how biological and ecological systems function. The AFM will be integrated into the curriculum to involve undergraduate students in multidisciplinary, experimental nanoscience and hands-on undergraduate research. The instrument will enhance Gonzaga University's outreach efforts within the greater Spokane and Eastern Washington area, including collaborative partnerships with regional schools, universities and local industry. Student involvement through industry partnerships directly contributes to enhancing skills of future generations of the U.S. workforce.\r\n\r\nThis AFM is capable of imaging samples of various sizes while maintaining a lateral and vertical resolution of < 0.1nm, and a force resolution of < 100pN in both normal and lateral directions. The AFM is furthermore equipped to allow measurements in static or continuous liquid flow at precisely controlled temperatures (within 1 degree C and up to 300 degrees C) as well as performing accurate nanomechanical and electrical conductivity measurements. These capabilities will enable the development of a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms (physical and chemical) by which nanoparticles in solution interact with substrates under sliding motion, resulting in the growth of functional nanostructures. These findings will accelerate development of novel nano and microscale electromechanical devices with potential applications in healthcare and automation. Measurements using the AFM will also help to establish fundamental relationships between mechanical properties of nanoscale films that form under sliding motion, and their friction and wear properties. These structure-property relationships will enable the design of advanced lubricant materials, with transformative impact on efficiency and reliability of industrial and transportation systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
