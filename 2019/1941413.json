 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign proposes to host and facilitate a Workshop on Department Plans for Broadening Participation in Computing. Broadening participation in computing (BPC) is an important priority for the National Science Foundation's  Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and, in furtherance of that priority, CISE, for some of its programs, is piloting a requirement that proposers include a BPC Plan with their proposal. As part of that effort, CISE is encouraging departments to create Department BPC Plans that their researchers can leverage in their individual proposals. This workshop will assist departments in developing those plans. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will host teams of 2-3 representatives, including the department chair, from 20-25 departments. The workshop will allow participants to share their own experiences with BPC activities, inform participants about the components of a BPC plan, let them know about ongoing and successful BPC activities that they can partner with, and assist them in developing and refining their own departmental BPC plan. After the workshop, a small team will spend additional time developing a white paper to provide guidance  to departments in developing their BPC plans. Once the participants' plans are completed, they will be encouraged to post them on BPCnet.org as exemplars.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
