 "awd_abstract_narration": "The motivation for this study is detection of a new acceleration in Ordonannsbreen, a glacier in the Negribreen Glacier System (NGS) in Arctic Svalbard, observied in May 2019 using satellite data. Glacial acceleration is a major source of uncertainty in assessments of sea level rise, and observations of glacial surging are rare and therefore poorly understood. In this RAPID response project, airborne geophysical data will be collected in this study, and in combination with satellite images and data leveraged from a separate study of neighboring Negribreen glacier, will address questions about glacier surge and the interaction between glacial acceleration and climate warming. The investigator will also advance use of machine learning to analyze complex satellite data. For outreach, the investigator will share observations with the public via a website about glacial surge and present results at local K-12 schools. In addition, this project will support training for graduate and undergraduate students, engaging them in field work and new methods for mathematical analysis.\r\n\r\nThe investigator has recently detected a new acceleration in Ordonannsbreen glacier via satellite data, and this study will leverage prior work on a surge in neighboring Negribreen glacier to understand changes in the larger glacier system. The motivating question is whether this event is simply another surge in an Arctic glacier or part of the larger disintegration of an entire glacier system. To address the research objective, the investigator will 1) collect airborne laser altimeter, image, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data in one field season in summer 2019; 2) derive a 3-dimensional representation of surface elevation in crevassed terrain and elevation change to estimate mass loss; and 3) address the question of whether the acceleration can be attributed to physical processes in the glacier system and/or in a warming environment. A crevasse-centered mathematical approach that integrates physical processes and machine learning will be applied in observation, analysis, and modeling.  Automated classification of crevasse types and other surface signatures will lead to a classification of acceleration types and aid in constraining parameters in thermo-mechanical glacier models, to be developed in future work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This problem had not been solved by the 2021 IPCC AR6, published in 2021, which used the term \"deep uncertainty\" to emphasize the importance of understanding glacial accelerations and other types of glacial instabilities. Glacier surges are the least researched type of glacial acceleration, largely because of the relative paucity of such events. A surge is an acceleration of a glacier or glacier system to 10-200 times its normal flow speed.<br /><br />Negribreen, a large glacier in Arctic Svalbard, has been surging since 2016 and continues to surge (2024). The team of the principal investigator of this project collected airborne data over Negribreen in 2017 and 2018, funded by NSF and NASA Earth Sciences.&nbsp; Negribreen last surged in 1935/36, thus, there has been no modern study of this event prior to this work. The Negribreen Glacier System (NGS) is located on Spitsbergen in Svalbard, it forms an outlet of the Filchnerfoenna ice cap. The calving front of Negribreen was located at approximately (78.573N, 19.083E) in 2019. Negribreen reached velocities of 22m/day in July 2017, heavily crevassed ice advanced into the Arctic Ocean, and mass transfer from the glacier to the ocean caused by the surge in a few months in 2017 was equivalent to 0.5-1% of global annual SLR. The fast moving ice of surging Negribreen stood in stark contrast to the slow-moving, smooth ice of its largest side glacier, Ordonannsbreen (Figure 1) - until in May 2019, the research team observed a sudden acceleration in Ordonannsbreen in satellite data of&nbsp; the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1, which motivated this research project. <br /><br />Central questions are:<br /><br />(1) Is the acceleration in Ordonnansbreen another surge?</p>\r\n<p>(2) Is the acceleration in Ordonannsbreen triggered by the surge in Negribreen?</p>\r\n<p>(3) Can surging lead to disintegration of an entire glacier system? Will the entire NGS rip apart?</p>\r\n<p>(4) Will the surge affect the source area of Negribreen, the Filchnerfoenna ice cap?</p>\r\n<p>(5) How does this surge compare to surges in other climates, especially in to the surge of the Bering-Bagley Glacier System in Alaska?</p>\r\n<p>(6) How does surging potentially change under changing climatic conditions?<br /><br />The sudden acceleration in a second large glacier in the NGS provided a unique opportunity to collect data to study these questions. Data collection and analysis were central objectives of the study, which will allow investigations of the more complex questions in future research. Some answers to the complex questions 5 and 6 were already derived under this project.<br /><br />To study these questions, airborne&nbsp; geophysical data&nbsp; (laser altimeter data, differential GPS data, time-lapse imagery, systematic photography and IMU data) were collected over Ordonnansbreen and Negribreen in August 2019, to derive a 3-dimensional representation of surface elevation in crevassed glacial terrain and&nbsp; elevation change to estimate mass loss. The analysis centers on crevasses as indicators of surges and their phases. The study also included an in-depth analysis of surface height data (altimeter data) from NASA's Ice Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite ICESat-2, using all ICESat-2 data from 2019 and 2020.<br /><br />Main findings:<br /><br />(1) The acceleration in Ordonannsbreen is caused by the surge in Negribreen. Ice loss is especially high in the shear margin between the two glaciers, leading to lack of buttressing, which causes the acceleration in Ordonannsbreen.</p>\r\n<p><br />(2) Data collected over icefalls leading from the source area of Negribreen, the Filchnerf&oslash;nna ice cap, indicate that the surge affects the ice cap above the glacier system, causing mass (ice) transfer down from the ice cap into the glacier area and from there into the Arctic Ocean.&nbsp; This shows that effects from the surge in today's climate reach beyond the surging glacier itself. This process of extension is ongoing and the question of potential disintegration cannot be fully answered at project end.</p>\r\n<p><br />(3) A study of numerical modeling connected with observations of an Alaskan Glacier System (the Bering Bagley Glacier System) was completed and published.
