 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project is to chemically recycle carbon dioxide, which would otherwise be released to the atmosphere, to useful fuels and products thus providing a closed loop for production and emissions for many common products. Virtually every industry uses petroleum and/or natural gas, either through transportation or plastics (e.g., packaging), and there is no current commercial CO2 /carbon recycling process. The current routes for CO2 conversion are crippled by one or more of the following challenges: (a) very low rates of CO2 conversion, (b) high temperature of operation, (c) non-selective product formation, and (d) issues with scalability of the process.\r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to re-purpose CO2 from a pollutant to a feedstock for fuels and chemicals. Recent research has achieved a proof-of-concept on reverse water-gas shift chemical looping (RWGS-CL). Carbon monoxide (CO), a major component of synthesis gas, is selectively produced, which can be used as the backbone to any chemical or fuel through existing processes. Preliminary performance results and literature findings indicate that this process operation could contribute to unprecedented efficiencies and potential scalability within a small footprint compared to other futuristic technologies that convert CO2. The RWGS-CL process operates at reasonable temperatures with high CO2 conversion rates and highly selective towards CO formation. The RWGS-CL process is thus, unique and transformative in that it addresses all of the major challenges and paves the way for a sustainable generation of greener hydrocarbon fuels at industrial scale. This project aims to enable prototype construction of the technology at 100 x scale of lab tests using formed materials (pellets) capable of operating at industrial scale, a reactor model to capture the performance and size of the RWGS-CL unit, and a techno-economic analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this STTR, we focused on repurposing CO2 to chemical intermediates.  The approach is to reduce sequestered or direct air captured CO2 to CO via the Reverse Water Gas Shift Chemical Looping reaction (RWGS-CL).  Electrolyzed H2 is supplemented to form synthesis gas, which is the starting block for downstream chemical commodities.  The RWGS-CL is promoted utilizing oxygen deficient materials called perovskite oxides (ABO3) to convert CO2 to CO.  First, perovskite oxides are reduced to their oxygen deficient state (ABO3-&delta;) by heating at high temperatures (400 &deg;C &ndash; 600 &deg;C).  Our looping process, uses separate CO2 and electrolyzed H2 streams, making it 98% selective towards CO while also maintaining high rates.  Another task was to pelletize these perovskite oxide powders, specifically La0.5Ba0.5FeO3 and La0.75Sr0.25FeO3, for use in bench and larger scale reactors.   We were able to pelletize, both by tableting and extrusion, utilizing a binder.  The pelletized catalysts were ~0.8 mm in length with a 1.5 mm diameter.  Catalyst strength and durability was increased by pelletization, and subsequent characterization showed the pellets had the same chemical signature as the powders previously used in prior research.\n\nOnce structurally sound, batch reaction tests proved that both La0.5Ba0.5FeO3 and La0.75Sr0.25FeO3 pellets provided stable yields for both reduction and oxidation reactions during chemical looping.  With these data, we also were able to perform temperature profile experiments.  From these, and future experiments, a comprehensive model for the reactor, including temperature and mass transfer profiles, will be constructed.\n\nA detailed techno-economic analysis was done based at two capacities 3,000,000 and 11,474 mton/yr CO2.  The higher capacity value was chosen to reflect average CO2 emissions for an urban power plant.  The lower capacity was chosen to reflect output based on a base-scale commercially available electrolyzer. Both methanol (via methanol synthesis or MS) and hydrocarbon fuel (via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or FTS) were evaluated as commodities.  At the larger scale, break even costs were $5.69/gallon of diesel and $2.32/gallon for methanol.  Smaller scale costs have break even costs of $6.95/gallon and $2.51/gallon for diesel and methanol, respectively.  These costs can improve with the inclusion of 45Q tax credits to $5.45/ gal for diesel from FTS and $2.01 /gal for methanol from MS (at 3,000,000 mtons CO2/yr) and $6.95/gal for FTS diesel and $2.51/gal MS methanol (at 11,474 mton/y.  The power needed for electrolysis is a significant factor for elevating costs in both capex ($8 M @ 11,474 mton CO2) and opex (~$3.4 M/yr).  Sensitivity analysis shows that hydrogen production costs need to be less than $0.5/kg H2 produced in order to compete within the existing market price for methanol synthesis.   Additional technology for incorporating renewable electricity for hydrolysis is necessary to allow this promising technology to compete in today\u2019s market.  The analysis for this project utilized the cost of electrolysis as $1.88/kg H2 produced, as indicated by manufacturer\u2019s technical specifications.  Additional progress in renewable hydrolysis will allow for production of chemicals from CO2 from the technology developed in this project, and will be contribute to sustainable use of liquid fuels without contributing to global warming. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy Roberge"
