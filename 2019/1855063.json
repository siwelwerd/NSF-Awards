 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States suffers billions of dollars in insured losses each year from damaging hail storms and the societal and economic costs of such storms have been increasing. Over 10 million properties in the U.S. were damaged by hail in 2017 alone. Recent examples of catastrophic hailstorms include a $2.3 billion loss hail event impacting Denver in 2017, a $1.4 billion loss hail event in San Antonio in April 2016 that included 4.5+ inch hailstones, and a 2012 hailstorm in Amarillo, TX that produced 2-m drifts of hail that washed out roads and brought traffic to a standstill. Unfortunately, none of these events were anticipated ahead of time. This proposal will identify what type of environments produce such high impact hail events, and how the physical processes that produce hail are affected by environmental processes. The improved understanding of hail growth will be incorporated into a hail forecasting system within national weather prediction models to improve hail forecasts, which is in line with NSF's mission to advance national health, prosperity and welfare and to secure the national defense. With improved short-term (< 1 h) hail forecasts, immediate threats could be avoided, such as recommending that attendees at outdoor stadiums or events take shelter. Improved intermediate-term forecasts (1-3 days) could result in recommended action that required more time-intensive planning, such as moving aircraft under shelter, notifying insurance adjusters, and working with county-level emergency managers to have contingency plans in place for public outdoor events. Knowledge of the expected type of event, such as giant hail or lots of small hail (or \"blizzard\" hail), in addition to merely hail size, would allow forecasters to better prepare the public: for example, a forecasted \"blizzard\" hail event might require a city to ready its plowing equipment and advise the public to avoid low-lying areas that could potentially flood. Additionally, knowledge of which environments are connected to which hail events types is a necessary step for developing hail forecasts on longer time scales, of subseasonal to seasonal scale and beyond. This proposal will also support a graduate student receiving a Ph.D. degree, two graduate students receiving M.S. degrees, and three undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nIn order to advance predictability and reduce the increasingly significant impact of hail on society, this proposal will accomplish the following four goals: \r\n1) Identify environmental controls on hail production for different hail threat classes (e.g., giant hail or >10 cm or 4 in, large amounts of small hail) and identify regime, seasonal and regional differences.\r\n2) Establish the physical relationship between hail threat class occurrence and environmental conditions. Determine what embryo source region characteristics increase the probability of favorable hail growth trajectories for different classes of hail threats and how these vary across realistic storm environments.\r\n3) Validate a microphysically complex hail trajectory model in light of newly available time-varying radar-retrieved wind and buoyancy fields and surface hail observations.\r\n4) Integrate new knowledge about environmental controls, three-dimensional hail trajectories, and embryo source regions into the CAM-HAILCAST hail model to improve operational forecasts of hail threats.\r\nObjective 1 will use an extensive hailstorm proximity sounding database available from the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) to explore environmental controls. Objective 2 will use idealized simulations to explore sensitivity to both environmental conditions and microphysical processes. Objective 3 will use a newly-developed radar-derived wind and microphysical dataset to drive a hail trajectory model which will be validated with surface hail observations. Finally, the improved hail forecasting model developed in Objective 4 will be tested against an independent subset of hail threat events from the SPC database. This proposed research will improve understanding of the basic processes underlying hail growth on both environmental- and storm-scales and how those vary across environments. It will determine which environments are most favorable to different hail threat classes (such as giant hail or large amounts of small hail) or hail sizes. It also moves beyond a purely statistical endeavor to ensure the physical processes underlying the environmental controls for each hail threat class are understood, including large updraft volumes, favorable placement of embryo source regions, and appropriate embryo sizes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This model is used to test how different environmental conditions affect the hail sizes produced by storms. We discovered that, the more wind speeds increase with height through the atmosphere, thunderstorm updrafts get wider, which leads to longer hailstone pathways and thus more opportunity to grow into bigger sizes. However, strong increases in windspeeds (when confined to the lowest 1-2 km of the atmosphere) paradoxically inhibits hail growth, because these conditions lead to faster horizontal winds in the storm&rsquo;s updraft. These faster horizontal winds transport hailstones too quickly through the updraft, limiting growth, resulting in smaller sizes.</span></p>\n<p><span>We also explored how changes to the amount and vertical distribution of thunderstorm&rsquo;s &ldquo;fuel&rdquo; (called &ldquo;instability&rdquo;) can affect hail. Contrary to popular belief, we found that there can be too much instability: after a certain threshold (which varies with how the wind speeds change with height), the winds in the updraft are too strong, limiting hailstone growth. Thus, there appears to be a &ldquo;goldilocks&rdquo; situation where just the right amount of instability for a given environmental wind profile will optimize hail growth. This research also pointed to the importance of environmental wind speeds and directions relative to the storm&rsquo;s motion, and moisture content, at midlevels (approximately 2-4 km above the ground). These conditions have not been used in hail prediction prior to this research, and are being explored by our collaborators for potential use in operational forecasts.</span></p>\n<p><span>We also used the PSU-HGTM to explore how hail production evolves throughout a storm&rsquo;s lifetime (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). We identified that changes to the storm&rsquo;s updraft structure can lead to significant variability in hail sizes produced, including maximum sizes more than doubling, and the number of severe (damaging) hailstones changing by more than a factor of 10. These substantial changes in hail result from normal processes internal to the storm, without any influences from the environment or other nearby storms. These results suggest that research attempting to determine hail size threats based on ground reports of hail size, which are always sparse and under sample the true variability and extent of hail, may lead to ambiguous results.</span></p>\n<p><span>As part of this research, we identified the most extreme hail sizes ever produced in storms, and introduced a new category &ndash; &ldquo;gargantuan&rdquo; &ndash; to represent these hailstones with maximum dimensions greater than 6 inches. Since our initial documentation of these extreme events, multiple other reports of gargantuan hailstones from around the world have been recorded. The environments and radar signatures associated with these events have been described, along with comparisons to storms producing smaller hail sizes to elucidate differences in storm structures and environments. We also estimated the theoretical upper limit to hail mass and maximum dimension based on statistical analysis of observed hail and the PSU-HGTM (<strong>Figure 3</strong>).</span></p>\n<p><span>The largest-ever dataset of natural hailstone shapes was analyzed. It was built from manual hailstone measurements in the field, as well as innovative infrared laser scanning techniques that provide high-resolution 3D hailstone models (<strong>Figure 4</strong>). Further, we developed a new technique to analyze the individual growth layers or &ldquo;rings&rdquo; inside hailstones (<strong>Figure 5</strong>). Quantifying properties of these rings allowed us to evaluate for the first time assumptions about hailstone growth processes used in computer models. This revealed a bias in the number of clear layers our computer models produced. This bias was related, in part, to the assumption used in all computer models that hailstones are spherical (which isn&rsquo;t true). Using these results and the 3D shapes database, we introduced new hailstone physics for the intricately linked processes associated with non-spherical hailstones, including the impact of lobes or spikes often found on natural hailstones. The new physics have been implemented into a version of the PSU-HGTM to investigate their impact on hail sizes produced in storms; results will be reported in a forthcoming publication. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>This newly discovered knowledge about the environmental controls on hail production and the fundamental processes leading to different hail threats has been incorporated into conceptual models used globally by operational weather forecasters and scientists studying hailstorms. Findings about hail growth processes and newly developed ways to implement this physics into computer models are leading to improvements in operational hail models. The PSU-HGTM is being used by other scientists around the world for their own research. This project also supported the studies of a PhD student at Penn State University.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/18/2023<br>\nModified by: Matthew&nbsp;R&nbsp;Kumjian</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1855063/1855063_10608946_1700317334830_Figure5--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1855063/1855063_10608946_1700317334830_Figure5--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1855063/1855063_10608946_1700317334830_Figure5--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example cross section (slice) of a real hailstone collected in Australia.
