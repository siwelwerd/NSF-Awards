 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the conference \"Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM 35)\" held March 15-17, 2019 at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  The conference focuses on recent developments in analysis, especially in the fields of harmonic analysis, complex analysis, and operator theory.  One topic discussed will be the relation between operator theoretic inequalities and isoperimetric type inequalities.  Other speakers will discuss rational functions on the bidisc, a topic with connections to function theory, control engineering, and electrical engineering.  Another subject will be inner functions and zero sets for spaces of analytic functions.  A further topic is Leibniz type rules and bilinear estimates and their applications in analysis and partial differential equations.  In all, there will be six plenary talks; other participants have the opportunity to present twenty-minute contributed talks.\r\n\r\nSeveral distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of grant support an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference and to interact with other researchers.  The organizing committee will make this funding opportunity known through a number of different activities.  More information is available at the conference web page: https://math.ua.edu/conferences/seam-35/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe 35th annual Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM) was held on the University of Alabama campus March 15-17, 2019. This conference focuses on the field of mathematical analysis, especially operator theory, functional analysis, and harmonic analysis.  There is also some focus on partial differential equations.  These are important areas of mathematics with many applications to other fields. \n\nSEAM is held each year at a university in the southeastern United States (broadly defined).  Researchers from all over the country and even from other countries come to these meetings. \n\nIntellectual Merit: The researchers invited to give plenary talks were recognized leaders in their fields or early career mathematicians who are well known for their work.  Participants were able to learn from their talks and interact with them.  Many participants also gave talk about their work. A large number of these participants were graduate students. \n\nBroader Impact:  Many of the participants were women, and a substantial fraction were graduate students or other early career mathematicians.  These participants were given opportunities to meet senior researchers and to gain exposure.  This is particularly important for young researchers and is very important in maintaining an active research community.  Many of the junior participants gave talks.  This helps them to learn to explain their research to others and helps more senior people learn about their research.\n\nThe grant from the National Science Foundation was mainly used to reimburse travel costs for 40 participants.  We especially focused on junior participants.  A small amount of the grant was used to pay for office supplies, such as folders and name tags for conference participants. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/04/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy Ferguson"
