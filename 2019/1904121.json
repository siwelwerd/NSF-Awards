 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial travel support for 13 U.S.-based postdoctoral researchers and graduate students to attend the 2019 Dead Sea Water Workshop in Ein Gide, Israel on February 4-7, 2019. The first offering of this thematic meeting will be devoted to discussions on recent developments and emerging trends in nanofluidic phenomena and materials, including separation and transport phenomena in nanoscale channels and pores. The meeting intends to achieve three main objectives: (1) to educate students on water scarcity and current challenges facing society; (2) to disseminate the latest research results on the physics of transport at the nanoscale; and (3) to grow a research community concerned with developing and utilizing new materials and phenomena for next-generation water-purification devices. The discussion-rich format of the meeting, alongside the engaging lineup of invited speakers, will provide a vibrant and enriching experience for professional development. The workshop location provides a unique opportunity for students and scientists to explore an operating wastewater treatment facility that is actively piloting water reuse technologies. Additionally, enabling U.S.-based researchers to interact with Israeli counterparts serves to build and strengthen international research infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe Dead Sea Workshop organizing committee is comprised of both American and Israeli researchers, and invited speakers from the U.S. and Europe feature prominently in the program. The workshop will feature 10 technical sessions, two poster sessions, an organized pilot facility tour, and abundant unstructured discussion periods to catalyze new collaborative relationships and research ideas. The 2019 Dead Sea Water Workshop will focus, specifically, on the following topics: (1) fundamentals of fluid flow and confinement on water transport in nanochannels and nanostructures; (2) phase transitions and equilibria in nanoscale pores and channels; (3) mechanism of ion transport and ion selectivity in nanoscale pores; (4) theory and modeling approaches for understanding nanofluidic and electrosorption phenomena; and (5) carbon and related nanomaterials for novel membrane technologies and electrochemical separations. The topic of the new meeting is unique amongst existing conferences and workshops that more broadly focus on membrane science. Furthermore, the style of the workshop will encourage meaningful interactions between junior and senior researchers and provides opportunities for in-depth discussion and professional development. The award of travel subsidies is expected to attract young, diverse scientists to a meeting they may not otherwise be able to attend.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
