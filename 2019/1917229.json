 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowing how people adapt their land use in light of changing economic and trade relationships is important for understanding environmental and land management decisions. These decisions become even more complicated when they involve groups with substantial power differences. The archaeological record, with its numerous example cases and substantial time depth, holds valuable insights regarding these issues. This doctoral dissertation project, directed by Kaitlyn Davis and Dr. Scott Ortman of the University of Colorado-Boulder, will assess the interplay between Spanish impositions and Native agency with regard to Pueblo economic and agricultural practices in 16th and 17th century New Mexico. The goal is to better understand the Pueblo agricultural economy prior to and following Spanish contact. The data collected for this project will address gaps in the understanding of the implications of and responses to colonialism in the Americas, reassessing and complicating the colonial narrative in light of Native agency. The data will also help fill in gaps in the understanding of how indigenous arid-land agricultural systems operated, and continue to operate, in the Americas. The multi-crop agricultural potential model produced by this project will be instructive as to where good agricultural areas are in the study area today, and thus has environmental sustainability value and will be of use to scholars as well as farmers. Finally, working with local landowners and Pueblo community members through every step of this project will provide educational opportunities and a positive example of collaborative archaeology.\r\n\r\nSpanish colonization of the Northern Rio Grande region in New Mexico contributed to demographic changes, additional demands on the finite land base, and changes in the economic system, including changes in trade networks and taxation. The recent literature on this period has tended to interpret changes in the archaeological record as deriving from the impositions of or resistance to Spanish colonization. While both did occur, what has been overlooked is the extent to which Pueblo people also took advantage of the opportunities presented by introduced Spanish crops, technologies, and livestock, adapting them for Pueblo use and incorporating them into Pueblo life. In previous scholarship, considerations of local agricultural production have been largely divorced from the economic system they fit into. In this project, the researchers will assess the role of Spanish introductions in Pueblo economics and settlement by: 1) creating spatial models of agricultural potential for indigenous and introduced crops and combining these with artifact and settlement data; 2) determining associations between field types and crop types by collecting and analyzing microbotanical samples from various field types at two pre-Hispanic Pueblos and two colonial-era Pueblos; and 3) assessing changing investment in various field types, technologies, and associated crops through surface survey of field features and dateable artifacts at these four sites. These efforts will yield a better picture of agricultural potential versus agricultural investment through time to reveal Native choices in a changing economic and social system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project investigated Puebloan agricultural practices before and after Spanish colonization at four pueblos (two pre-Hispanic (Poshuouingeh and Pueblo Blanco) and two colonial-era (K'uuyemugeh (Cuyamungue) and San Marcos)) to understand how Puebloan agriculture changed as a result of Spanish colonization.</p>\n<p>The researchers used environmental data, such as historic precipitation and temperature estimates for the study area, to examine ancient fields around each pueblo to estimate possible crop yields for each field type, such as floodplain fields versus upland gravel mulch fields. These agricultural potential models allowed the researchers to identify the relative attractiveness of various microenvironments for indigenous and introduced crops and made it possible for the team to assess the impact of agricultural technology for crop growth. The model can also be useful more broadly for determining environmentally-feasible farming areas today.</p>\n<p>In October 2019, the crew completed the process of recording agricultural features and collecting soil samples. The agricultural features found during this archaeological survey reveal how Pueblo agricultural technology differed before and during colonial times. The researchers also consulted ethnohistoric documents and oral traditions to learn of social and economic constraints under which Puebloan people operated that would influence their agricultural practices.</p>\n<p>During field work, the researchers found sixty-nine agricultural features at Poshuouingeh, thirty-three agricultural features at Pueblo Blanco, forty-three agricultural features around K'uuyemugeh, and sixty agricultural features at San Marcos. These features included cobble-bordered gravel-mulch fields, terraces, barrow pits, and water collection features. They also found datable ceramics and agricultural tools around the features. The artifacts found in fields provide dates on when each field was in use. This allows the researchers to assess changes in the crops planted and field types used between the pre-colonial and colonial periods.</p>\n<p>Project scientists have completed the soil sample pollen analysis, and Davis has nearly completed the analysis of phytoliths in the soil samples from different field types to determine what crops were grown in the agricultural field features at pre-colonial compared to colonial-era sites. Phytoliths, which can be thought of as plant fossils, are silicified remains of plant cells that are diagnostic of plant type as well as the part of the plant they came from. Comparing phytoliths and pollen found in pre-colonial versus colonial-era contexts is providing information on potential changes in crop types, crop ratios, and harvesting and preparation practices among the four sites surveyed.</p>\n<p>The goals for the project for the remainder of 2020 are to finish analyzing the survey data and the soil samples. Initial comparisons of the features found at pre-colonial versus colonial sites revealed that the two pre-colonial sites had more check dams (water-control features), stone tools, and evidence of stone-tool manufacture than the colonial sites; and the two colonial sites had more barrow pits (function yet undetermined) than the two pre-colonial sites. These observations, as well as other potential patterns, will be explored as the research continues.</p>\n<p>In addition to developing an agricultural potential model, this project also produced a new soil sampling and testing protocol with broad applicability for archaeology and other applications. These innovative ways of learning from the archaeological record (core sampling and phytoliths) are more cost effective and less destructive than traditional methods, and thus are able to be done in a greater variety of locations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;This study and the resulting data have broader applications than academic research. The data attest to the agency of Native people in responding to colonialism. The research questions and plan were informed by interest and concerns of contemporary Native people.
