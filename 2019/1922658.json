 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid advances in computational speed, data availability, and the development of novel data analysis methods have birthed a new field: data science. This new field requires rigorously trained, cross-disciplinary, and ethically responsible data scientists. Producing researchers who are \"data science natives\" requires the development of an inclusive, interdisciplinary ecosystem supported by coursework and professional development activities to foster education and training. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the Center for Data Science at New York University will build such an environment entitled FUTURE. This project anticipates training fifty (50) PhD students, including twenty (20) funded trainees, from data science and other disciplines such as mathematics, computer science, physics, neuroscience, health sciences, and psychology. An additional 145 MS or PhD students will engage in select courses and professional development opportunities offered through the project.\r\n\r\nThe traineeship will fill a significant gap by rigorously training data scientists who (1) develop methodology and harness statistical tools to find answers to questions that transcend the boundaries of traditional academic disciplines; (2) effectively communicate to extract crisp questions from big, heterogeneous, uncertain data; (3) translate fundamental research insights into data science practice in the sciences, medicine, industry, and government; and (4) are aware of the ethical implications of their work. These objectives will be achieved by a combination of an innovative core curriculum, a novel data assistantship mechanism that provides training of skills transfer through rotations and internships, and communication and entrepreneurship modules. In addition, trainees will address fundamental research questions in mathematical and statistical aspects of data science, machine learning, domain applications, and ethical data use. The program will create a sustainable model of societal impact and will produce teaching materials and methodologies for incorporating translation and responsibility into data science curricula. FUTURE will build on the Center for Data Science track record of attracting and retaining a diverse cohort of graduate students and will create an interdisciplinary graduate traineeship that includes diversity of thought by design, by supporting a multitude of methodologies, application domains, and avenues for impact.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
