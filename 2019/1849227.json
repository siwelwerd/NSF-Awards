 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, known as Maine-eDNA, aims to achieve transformational understanding of ecosystem dynamics and sustainability in coastal regions through the application of advanced genomic analysis techniques on environmental samples.  This approach, termed environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis, potentially allows for all species present in an ecosystem to be detected in parallel.  Coastal ecosystems exhibit complex spatial and temporal variability, and therefore it has typically been necessary to commit significant time and resources to characterize even small features of the overall system. The vision of Maine-eDNA is to show how the eDNA approach can transform how aquatic ecosystems are studied and managed. The project focuses its efforts across three watersheds along the Maine coast - Casco Bay, Damariscotta, and Penobscot River - and across the major habitat types (lake, river, estuary, coastal) within each watershed.  Maine-eDNA's research will explore questions related to sustainable fisheries and harmful species, along with integrative studies that explore the transformational potential of big data and team science practices. The project's research activities will be integrated with an ambitious agenda to engage teachers, students, and environmental professionals across the state with targeted activities that will lead to a better-trained, more diverse STEM workforce.\r\n \r\nMaine-eDNA brings together several of the state's public and private academic institutions and independent research laboratories to focus on a shared goal of applying eDNA approaches to understand coastal ecosystem dynamics across spatial and temporal scales.  eDNA holds the promise of overcoming fundamental environmental sampling constraints by leveraging state-of-the-art molecular next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics technologies.  The project's research will involve a multi-year sampling campaign across several habitat types in three major Maine watersheds, augmented by targeted sampling and analyses to support project objectives.  eDNA approaches will be applied to coastal ecological problems of strong economic and societal relevance for the state, addressing research questions relating to sustainable fisheries (i.e., ecosystem-based restoration and early-life ecology) and harmful species (i.e., harmful algal and cyanobacterial blooms and invasive species).  Additional Maine-eDNA research efforts will study how applying big data and team science approaches can lead to more rapid advances in understanding complex systems.  To broaden the impact of its research agenda, Maine-eDNA's efforts will also include extensive education and outreach activities that will emphasize connections with the state's Native American and rural populations, as well as development opportunities for teachers and environmental professionals.  The project will also build new partnerships and strengthen existing ties with Maine's resource managers and fishing industries.  Maine-eDNA promises to have a strong beneficial impact on the research capacity of the participating institutions and on the state overall.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
