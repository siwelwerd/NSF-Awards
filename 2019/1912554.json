 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need to understand and manage ecosystems at larger regional to continental scale macrosystem levels is becoming increasingly crucial with global climate changes and impacts of exotic plants and animals in freshwater rivers and lakes. Macrosystem management requires an understanding of how different levels of spatial complexity (within a stream reach to entire river valley scales) and biotic organization (populations to ecosystems) affect the functioning of rivers and lakes. The present study will provide this information for 18 rivers spread equally between the two largest temperate steppe biomes of the world: the North American Great Plains and the Euro-Asian Steppes (including those in Mongolia). This project will provide research experiences for under-represented participants (particularly rural and Native American students), stimulate STEM program recruitment in largely under-represented (EPSCoR) states, support some faculty and students at primarily undergraduate institutions, and contribute to scientific education at both graduate and undergraduate institutions in two countries.\r\n\r\nThese rivers flow through 3 major types of ecoregions within these temperate steppe biomes: mountain steppe shrublands, short-to-tall grasslands, and semi-arid shrublands. Scientists and students from the USA and Mongolia will sample the structure and functioning of these 18 rivers in a variety of hydrogeomorphic areas, such as constricted, meandering, braided, and anastomosing channel sections. Despite their similarity in biome and ecoregional types, the river macrosystems of the Great Plains and the Mongolian steppes vary substantially in fauna, flora, and community through ecosystem functioning. These variations result from differences in climatic patterns, the degree of riverine landscape modification (e.g., by dams, levees, and riparian modification), and the naturalness of the resident fauna. For example, most rivers in the USA contain some dams and many exotic fauna have been introduced, while the vast majority of Mongolian rivers contain no dams and their aquatic fauna is almost exclusively natural and different from those in the USA. Moreover, the Central Asian subcontinental area of Mongolia has one of the strongest warming signals on earth, with air temperatures rising three times faster than the overall northern hemisphere average. Consequently, riverine macrosystems in the USA can help predict changes to Mongolian rivers as a result of pending dam construction and possible species introductions to some rivers, while knowledge of responses of Mongolian macrosystems to more rapid climatic changes can help predict future effects in U.S. rivers. Therefore, this project's goals are to: (a) compare and contrast hierarchical scaling relationships and effects of system drivers and cross-scale interactions on rivers in similar biomes and ecoregions of the two continents; and (b) evaluate effects of climatic changes and anthropogenic disturbance to these river macrosystems.",

Macrosystems research examines interactions within and between scales to understand emergent properties of these large-scale phenomena (Figure 1). More specifically, we&nbsp;defined&nbsp;macrosystems research as research that is \"often conducted at spatial scales where humans impact the environment and alter broad-scale ecosystem services. Thus, the research has important relevance for developing environmental policies that lead toward the sustainability of nature\" (Thorp&nbsp;et al. 2021). For example, comparison of rivers within similar biomes (in our case grassland biomes) but under different climate regimes, with differing teleconnections, and with differing land use (i.e. damming, row crop, domesticated herding), may provide points of reference for natural resource management between regions with little to no impact from agricultural practices and regions impacted and impaired by agricultural practices. At these scales we can explore whether the synergistic effects of climate and, say, over grazing may have greater impacts in rivers with monsoonal weather patterns and changing mountain snow pact relative to rivers not exhibiting monsoonal weather patterns and with more stable mountain snow pact.</p>\n<p>We focused on roles of hierarchical scales (including functional process zones or FPZs), system drivers, cross-scale interactions, and changing climates in driving system metabolism, food webs, and biodiversity traits in rivers of temperate steppe biomes, in three different ecoregions&nbsp;in two different countries, the U.S. and Mongolia&nbsp;(Figures 2, 3). We sampled 96 sites over the three years of this project.</p>\n<p>Given the large, complex nature of our study we organized research groups for different facets of ecosystem function. Our group focused on benthic invertebrate taxonomic diversity and related that diversity to ecosystem function through analysis of functional trait diversity. Our work contributed to the fundamental and applied macrosystem biology by processing and identifying over 150,000 specimens from over 314 taxa (some taxa await external confirmation). This task represents efforts by Bolortsetseg Erdenee working with Jon Gelhaus at the Academy of Natural History, Drexel University, Oyunchuluun Yadamsuren, working in the Mongolian National University of Education, and Suvdaa Chuluunbat working with Bazartseren Boldgiv at the National University of Mongolia.

Members of the benthic invertebrate research group in MACROrivers participated in field work at all sampling sites. Preliminary results indicate greater macroinvertebrate diversity in U.S. sites relative to Mongolian sites and major biogeographic differences in communities.

Functional richness and redundancy also varied significantly within rivers in each ecoregion along the river continuum, and the RCC models allowed us to establish which variables and spatial scales were important in driving variation in functional trait richness measures. These scales and variables differed between watersheds. For example, the percent of fine sediments such as sand and silt drove functional diversity in a prairie watershed whereas, slope and sinuosity drove functional diversity in a mountain steppe watershed.</p>\n<p>(4) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Examining scaling effects at 4 hierarchical spatial levels.</span> Our research using graphical theory analysis tested the effects of interactions between variables at different scales.
