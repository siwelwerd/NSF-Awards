 "awd_abstract_narration": "The subject of this research is mathematical problems of physics of open systems--the systems that exchange energy with the environment.  The questions to be addressed range from general and theoretical to study of specific systems, designed with applications in mind.  An example of a theoretical (and, indeed, foundational) problem, studied by the PI, is a systematic approach to quantum mechanics, using quantum stochastic calculus.  This project aims at elucidating well-known problems with interpretation of quantum theory, including state reduction and the measurement problem.  At the same time, the PI will collaborate with experimental physics groups on design and explanation of laboratory experiments.  One project of this type is concerned with the emergent behavior in motion of interacting agents.  In this project, aggregation and separation of light-sensitive robots is studied, emphasizing the role of sensorial delay.  A new project, in which sophisticated mathematical methods meet with laboratory experiments, addresses electrical conductivity of graphene sheets and of active carbon.  The latter topic is important for the design of quantum devices and thus is immediately aligned with Quantum Leap, one of the NSF's 10 Big Ideas. \r\n\r\nNoise and disorder are ubiquitous phenomena, particularly important in the study of open systems.  Their mathematical models use several tools of probability theory. The most important one is stochastic analysis, studying differential equations with noise; this is one of the principal topics to be investigated in this project.  Other methods include ergodic theory, functional analysis and dynamical systems. The PI will continue training graduate students and junior researchers: a major part of this research will be done in collaboration with junior researchers mentored by the PI.  Collaboration with three physics groups--experimental as well as theoretical--will be a crucial part of the project, determining the particular research directions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project studies open systems---systems which interact with their environment and thus cannot be considered as isolated.  Every system interacts with the environment to some extent; the theory of open systems deals with scenarios in which this interaction cannot be neglected and has important and measurable effects.  If quantum effects play an important role, analysis of the system requires methods of quantum theory.  A system in which quantum phenomena are not pronounced is called classical.\n\nThe quantum part of the project addressed measurement as a form of interaction of a system with the environment.  PI and his collaborators studied different descriptions of the system's dynamics, adapted to different measurement methods. as well as conditions under which several quantum measurements give consistent results.\n\nClassical systems studied in this project consist of several moving agents, such as bacteria or man-made robots.  These agents interact with each other and this interaction leads to self-organizing or emergent behavior.  For example, robot swarms can aggregate or deaggregate, while the density of a bacterial population may vary spatially.  Understanding emergent effects may have important applications.\n\nThe interaction of a system with the environment can be often successfully modelled by introducing random noise into the description of the system's dynamics.  This was the approach of the PI in this project which thus used methods of probability theory. \n\nThe main outcomes of the project are:\n\n1.  Designing a way to compare experimental results with a theoretical model of a laser-stimulated atom.\n\n2.  Mathematical justification of an algorithm widely used in numerical studies of quantum optical systems and a proposal of a mathematical description of the quantum measurement process.\n\n3.  Extension of the theory of Spectrum Broadcasting Structures to the case of continuous spectrum.  \n\n4.  Mathematically rigorous derivation of an equation describing the dynamics of a system of moving agents, allowing comparison with experiment.\n\n5.  Detailed analysis of a wide class of models describing diffusive phenomena, including models of experiments.\n\nSeveral young researchers participated in various parts of this project, including two doctoral students working with PI.  Their dissertations are entirely based on the research funded by this award.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jan Wehr"
