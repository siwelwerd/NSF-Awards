 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornados, and earthquakes, pose a continuous threat in the United States, which can result in economic losses as well as loss of life. Unpredictable weather patterns have led to more severe and frequent natural disasters and, therefore, mitigating the impact of hazards on building structures is important for continuity in national welfare and prosperity following a disaster. Aside from building structures that can sustain various extreme events, modern and future architecture has shifted towards complex freeform structures, beyond simple geometries, to achieve aesthetically pleasing structures and to make efficient use of space.  A solution that simultaneously addresses all the above issues will require redefining some of the conventional paradigms in construction material design and deployment.  This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will investigate a new construction material approach for building skins and facades that are moldable to various complex geometries and, at the same, have the ability to manipulate waves imparted to the buildings and dissipate energy from high velocity winds.  The moldability will be achieved by relief cutting solid panels made of wood and metals with certain microstructural patterns, which is a low-cost process and hence suitable for the building industry.  While relief cutting promotes flexible surfaces, this approach generally reduces the load carrying ability of the panels, which may not be desirable.  This study will provide a means to potentially turn the disadvantage of the cutting method into an advantage, i.e., utilizing the cut patterns for tuning the dynamic properties to better resist hazard loadings.  Because of the architected nature, the cut surfaces are expected to display a wide range of wave and vibration control and energy dissipation mechanisms.  Equipping buildings with the ability to redirect, localize, trap, and dissipate energy, instead of merely resisting the impacted forces, can lead to a more efficient hazard mitigation strategy. This research can advance structural engineering by pushing complex freeform shapes to a standard practice that intertwines aesthetic arguments, building performance requirements, and material design considerations. To a greater impact, freeform complex shapes can provide buildings with additional functionalities beyond their default load bearing and shelter capabilities.  This project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with interdisciplinary professional and research training opportunities.  Project data will be archived and made publicly available in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). \r\n\r\nThis research aims to provide fundamental knowledge regarding the interplay between complex freeform geometries, microstructural morphologies, constituent properties (viscoelastic and inelastic deformations), and mechanisms of wave propagation and energy dissipation in architectural materials. A technique known as relief cutting (or kerfing) will be used to endow thin material sheets with prescribed curved shapes and surface patterns. The objective of such patterning is two-fold. First, it will allow molding flat plates into a nearly endless array of complex freeform shapes to fulfill a variety of functional and aesthetic architectural needs. Second, it will induce a microstructural geometry and property modulation that can help manipulate a wide range of wave and vibration events, through energy absorption and dissipation mechanisms. After a simulation-based design stage exploring the design space available via kerfing, freeform components will be fabricated, molded into shape, and tested. In the design and testing of laboratory specimens, excitations that mimic the dynamic loads of high velocity winds will be accounted for to realize stress and deformation fields similar to those observed in realistic freeform structures used in actual architectural structures.  This research is high risk and high reward as it will be a significant departure from traditional construction methodologies: 1) it will lead to a paradigm shift in building design, in which freeform complex shapes will be demonstrated to offer better resistance to dynamic loadings; 2) it will introduce a new and bold modular fabrication philosophy for freeform shapes that will generate minimal material waste, eliminate the need for mold casting, and simplify the logistics of material transportation; and 3) it harmoniously will blend dynamic performance and architectural constraints - two requirements that are often perceived to be mutually exclusive - by taking advantage of the intrinsic mechanical and aesthetic attributes of complex shapes and microstructural patterns.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Kerfing is a perforation process (performed via laser or water-jet cutting on a variety of material platforms) consisting of introducing an intricate pattern of cuts in a thin structure in a fashion that drastically increases its compliance. Kerfing can be performed on a variety of material platforms, including composites, such as medium-density fiberboard (MDF), and metals like aluminum or steel.</p>\n<p>Kerfed panels are especially appealing for architectural applications, where free-form structures have become increasingly ubiquitous for the design of building facades thanks to their ability to meet simultaneously aesthetic and functional requirements. Interestingly, kerfed sheets can be shipped flat and easily deformed on-site before installation, with major implications for transportation and logistics. The periodic microstructure of kerfs allows classifying them as examples of elastic phononic crystals (PCs) and metamaterials. As a result, one can expect them to exhibit a whole array of dynamical properties classically observed in PCs, and specifically the ability to open bandgaps. Bandgaps are intervals of frequency in which wave propagation is forbidden. A material system exhibiting bandgaps behaves as a mechanical filter and can therefore be used as a frequency-selective vibration isolation device. The first objective of this study was to assess the general effectiveness of kerfed structures as bandgap materials. Recently, significant interest has revolved around the design of tunable structures capable of adjusting their behavior in response to externally applied stimuli. In this vein, the second objective of this study was to assess whether the intrinsic extreme deformability of kerfs can be leveraged as an effective tuning mechanism. After an initial exploration of two-dimensional kerfed sheets, the project focused on kerfed strips because of their extreme deformability and reconfigurability, achievable even under relatively small loads. Fig. 1 shows a few kerfed strips obtained from MDF material, subjected to a variety of bending and twist loads; one can appreciate that the strips can undergo extreme deformation.</p>\n<p>Overall, the project unveiled a rich bandgap behavior exhibited by kerfed strips, which can be controlled by coarseness of the kerf pattern. Figure 2 compares the bandgap availability between dense and coarse kerfs. The two band diagrams reveal a rich landscape of wave modes, that encompass in-plane as well as out-of-plane modes. While no total bandgaps (intervals in which attenuation of in-plane and out-of-plane waves is simultaneously achieved) are available in the plotted frequency range, one can observe flexural bandgaps in which out-of-plane motion is filtered. Such flexural bandgaps can be pinpointed to different resonant cell deformation mechanisms, as highlighted by the mode shapes depicted in Fig. 2.</p>\n<p>The project further explored the possibility to tune the response of kerfed stirps by subjecting them to extreme bending and twisting. This study was conducted experimentally on steel kerfed strips endowed with dense cuts. Figures 3(a) and (b) show the transmissibility (output response far from the excitation vs. response at the input point plotted as a function of frequency) for (a) a strip twisted by 180 degrees and (b) a strip bent to form a closed loop, respectively. The results are compared against the reference case of a flat strip. Two lessons are learnt from these results: 1) the bandgap behavior is overall fairly robust against deformation, even under extreme curvature and twist rates; 2) some corrections of the filtering behavior are observed in the form of broadening of certain bandgaps. Remarkably, the two deformations produce qualitatively similar corrections of the bandgap behavior, suggesting that they both trigger analogous modifications in the internal structure of the resonant units that have been deemed responsible for bandgap opening.</p>\n<p>The project has supported one graduate student, who has received training in the areas of vibration and wave mechanics, finite elements simulations, and laser vibrometry. The project has also contributed didactic material that will be instrumental for future outreach activities. Specifically, several kerfed sheets and strips used for the project have become part of a growing gallery of metamaterials specimens to be showcased at outreach events in partnership with local high schools as well as during departmental open houses for prospective students and the general public. The high deformability of these structures, which can be experienced manually, make them highly intuitive demonstration tools for effective experiential learning, thus allowing demystifying the physical complexity underpinning the field of mechanical metamaterials.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/17/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stefano&nbsp;Gonella</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1911678/1911678_10599933_1651979944311_MDF_Strips--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1911678/1911678_10599933_1651979944311_MDF_Strips--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Examples of MDF kerfed strips\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1911678/1911678_10599933_1651979944311_MDF_Strips--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Examples of MDF kerfed strips\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Kerfed strips exhibiting extreme compliance: (a) and (d) extreme bending; (b) combined bending and twisting; (c) twisting in bi-kerfed strip</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Stefano Gonella</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stefano&nbsp;Gonella</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Examples of MDF kerfed strips</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1911678/1911678_10599933_1655327194294_Kerfed_Strips_Band_Diagrams--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1911678/1911678_10599933_1655327194294_Kerfed_Strips_Band_Diagrams--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Band diagrams and selected mode shapes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1911678/1911678_10599933_1655327194294_Kerfed_Strips_Band_Diagrams--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Band diagrams and selected mode shapes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Band diagrams for (a) densely kerfed and (b) coarsely kerfed strips</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Stefano Gonella</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stefano&nbsp;Gonella</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Band diagrams and selected mode shapes</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1911678/1911678_10599933_1655327236926_Bandgap_Robustness-and-Tunability--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1911678/1911678_10599933_1655327236926_Bandgap_Robustness-and-Tunability--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bandgap robustness and tunability\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1911678/1911678_10599933_1655327236926_Bandgap_Robustness-and-Tunability--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bandgap robustness and tunability\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Evidence of bandgap tunability induced by (a) extreme twisting and (b) extreme bending</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Stefano Gonella</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stefano&nbsp;Gonella</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Bandgap robustness and tunability</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
