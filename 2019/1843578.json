 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to offers a way for semiconductor chip fabricators to extend Moore's Law and simultaneously allowing them to reduce costs in consumables and scrap wafers that have been damaged during polishing. Currently chip fabricators are challenged to continue Moore's Law due to the complexity and scale down sizes of semiconductor device structures. Improved computer chip performance is critical to countless applications as computers,mobile phones, tablets, and Internet of Thing have become ubiquitous in everyday life.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the challenges which the semiconductor industry faces trying to move beyond 14 nm technologies by using Chemical Mechanical Planarization. Polishing pads are used to planarize wafer surface for multilayer stack integration. Conventional polishing pad technology has randomly distributed micro pores that lead to non-uniform polishing and scratched due to stress concentration on asperities with less than 1% real contact area. Additionally, conventional pads require a pad conditioning process to re-generate pad surface. This project proposes engineering micro features on the pad surface using micro fabrication technologies. In addition, the real contact area between the pad and wafer will be controllable increasing to 5-10 percent of the total pad-wafer contact. This will make the polishing performance more precise and consistent. The micro features are designed to retain polishing slurry longer so to increase the number of active slurry abrasives for polishing. The contact area and feature design will be tunable to specific polishing performance requirements per customer applications. The independent multi-body structure of a hard top-pad with a soft sub-pad will increase the conformity of the pad and distribute the pressure from polishing evenly across the pad surface. This will significantly improve the chip-level planarization and wafer-level uniformity, as well as reducing the pad wear during polishing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The SBIR Phase I fund has allowed SMART PAD to optimize and validate the uniquely designed CMP pads for chipmakers to overcome the technical challenges in sub-7nm chip fabrications with the improved polishing performances. \n\nDuring Phase I, SMART PAD has successfully optimized the micro-features on the surface of Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) pad, tweaking three aspects of design; Parameter A, B, and C. The impact to polishing performances would be the sum of the positive and negative impact by tweaking these parameters. Through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA), four different geometries were analyzed for fluid flow. For the first round polishing tests, three different geometries and two different densities were narrowed down. The prototype pads were fabricated with micro-molding technology. The first round polishing tests were conducted with Oxide blanket wafers and Oxide Silica slurry at four different polishing conditions. We have found the trend that polishing speed (removal rate) can increase with the increase of Parameter A. From the first round tests, one geometry has been down-selected.
