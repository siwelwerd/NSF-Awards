 "awd_abstract_narration": "The miniaturization of power electronics is a key obstacle in the advancement and proliferation of electric aircraft and vehicles.  Electrification of transportation helps safeguard the environment and mitigates climate change.  The power density and consequently the miniaturization of power electronics is ultimately limited by the ability to remove heat.  More effective and reliable cooling mechanisms for heat sources with small surface area are needed.  For example, power semiconductor switches that have the highest power density are directly connected without packaging offering the lowest cost, failure rate, and thermal resistance.  These advantages are often undone by inadequate thermal transfer from the surface of the chip.  Immersion cooling is known to provide the most reliable and highest performance thermal interface for chip-scale devices; however, conventionally, immersion cooling relies on gravity-dependent (physical-orientation dependent) convection or physical pumping, which limits its application and miniaturization in aviation and mobile applications.  Ultimately, the goal of this project is to create a high reliability sealed cooling system with no moving parts.  This project will help to support of undergraduate research for women and underrepresented minorities and to uncover new concepts for the classroom in the thermal management of power electronics.\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to investigate combined methods and materials to greatly enhance the performance of immersion cooling without boiling.  This will involve: (1) investigating the combined cooling mechanisms that involve different physics that have not been previously examined and modeled; (2) using new combinations of measurement methods to quantitatively determine the conditions under which the effective heat transfer coefficient is improved; and (3) quantitatively determining the stability of new immersion cooling materials under thermal and physical stress.  New materials that undergo phase change without boiling will be studied.  Measurement methods will include Schlieren imaging using markers for flow and temperature and direct measurement of the channel temperature of gallium nitride semiconductor devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A key obstacle in miniaturization, which this project addresses, is the cost and reliability of thermal management and cooling. Electrification of transportation helps safeguard the environment and mitigates climate change through de-carbonization. A new method was invented and published to measure the temperature of the volume deep within power semiconductors where the actual heat from the electrical carriers is generated. The accuracy of this temperature measurement of 0.8% is higher than other known methods. Multiphysics simulations show that the new immersion cooling fluids together with using innovative physical phenomena that were developed in this project reduced the junction temperature of the power semiconductor devices by up to 35 degrees C and eliminated hotspots on the semiconductor surface. New experimental methods were also developed for vapor recovery making the collection of data more efficient and less costly.\n\n\nThe educational impacts from this project were new topics in three classes taught by the PI at the University of Michigan: EECS 418 Power Electronics (advanced undergraduate/beginning grad), EECS 615 Design of Power Electronics (grad), and EECS 616 Control and Modeling of Power Electronics (grad). In EECS 418, general methods to measure heat transfer to determine the performance of thermal management for power semiconductor devices; in EECS 615, methods of thermal design and management in power electronics using immersion cooling; in EECS 616, control methods to stabilize thermal measurements in power electronics and heat transfer modeling in advanced immersion cooling methods.
