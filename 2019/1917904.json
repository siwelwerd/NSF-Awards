 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding is to support 20 U.S.-based early-career researchers (students and postdoctoral researchers) to attend the 2019 International Conference on Resource Sustainability - Cities (icRS Cities 2019) to be held in Adelaide, Australia on July 1-3, 2019. The conference serves as a platform for researchers and practitioners around the world with diverse background and expertise to share the most recent ideas, outcomes, and practices on resources management for sustainable urban systems. Given that more than half of the world population now lives in cities, urban centers have become the primary sink of resources and energy, and major source of emissions and waste. icRS Cities 2019 will bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss how to achieve urban sustainability through wise resources management policy and practices. Attending the conference will allow the U.S.-based early-career researchers to showcase their research and develop networks with their peers around the world.\r\n\r\nA wide range of topics will be covered at the conference related to sustainable urban systems. Solutions to the complex urban sustainability challenges can only be developed via inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches. With participation of natural scientists, engineers, social scientists, industry practitioners, and policy makers, we expect that icRS Cities 2019 will provide an excellent venue for the broad sustainable resources management community to share their findings and opinions on urban sustainability. We also expect icRS Cities 2019 will fill key knowledge gaps which in turn contribute to enhance the holistic understanding of sustainability challenges facing urban systems worldwide.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
