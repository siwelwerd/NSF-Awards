 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the conference Modern Aspects of Complex Analysis and Its Applications, held at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, during August 19-23, 2019.  The meeting aims to foster interaction between experts and early-career mathematicians working in the field of complex analysis. The structure of the conference will comprise a number of workshop-style talks directed at beginning researchers that are focused on presenting and discussing fundamental ideas in the field. The organizers are making an effort to attract younger and minority researchers to participate in the conference.\r\n\r\nThe field of complex analysis is a classical discipline at the root of much of modern mathematics. Over the years, its boundaries have been pushed in many different and often surprising directions: from random geometric objects, to fractal geometry and dynamics, to discrete networks and data science.  The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers across generational cohorts in the field of complex analysis with various related areas, including random conformal maps, dynamical systems, and geometric function theory.  Topics discussed will include harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, quasiconformal maps, analysis on metric spaces, and probability.  More information can be found at the meeting web site https://www.math.ksu.edu/~pietro/seattle19.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
