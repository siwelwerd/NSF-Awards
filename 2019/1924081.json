The aim of GRC-CCUS and GRS-CCUS is to create a forum for discussing the latest scientific and technological efforts at the forefront of carbon management encompassing the development of novel materials, integrated reaction and transport pathways in natural and engineered environments, and the implications of these developments for CCUS deployment at the process and field scales. The emerging role of negative emissions technologies such as Direct Air Capture and Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage in the context of carbon management will be discussed. In this context, system-level assessments of the role and potential of CCUS systems in decarbonizing electricity, transportation, and heating networks is an integral aspect of this meeting. \r\n\r\nThe organization of the GRC Power Hour and the poster sessions dedicated for scientific presentations by early career researchers, postdoctoral research scientists and graduate students are intended to foster engagement and the development of a future pipeline of talent capable of handling emerging challenges in the area of CCUS. The interdisciplinary nature and the openness of GRC/GRS format in terms of sharing unpublished data will ensure the broader impacts of this conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
