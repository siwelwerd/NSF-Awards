 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue the most comprehensive program to measure the cold gas history of the universe with the NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA).  The goal of this project is to complete the picture of galaxy formation and evolution throughout cosmic history. Cold gas is the fuel for the formation of stars in galaxies. It holds the key towards understanding the buildup of stars since early epochs. This extension of the VLA program will provide measurements across approximately eleven of the 13.7 billion years since the Big Bang. With more than ten times longer exposure times, it will lead to the identification of unprecedentedly faint galaxies.  In addition to being published in academic journals, the findings of this program will be publicly disseminated to children, young students, and general audiences. It will directly address one of the highest-priority science objectives of the current decade by revealing how galaxies like our Milky Way and its ancestors grew to become what they are today.  \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of the second phase of the NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) CO Luminosity Density at High Redshift (COLDz) survey, with the principal goal to systematically measure the volume density of molecular gas through cosmic times, i.e., the fundamental driver of star formation and stellar mass buildup in galaxies since the Big Bang. Motivated by tensions between our current observations and state-of-the-art modeling efforts, the proposed expansion will provide order-of-magnitude improvements over the initial measurements. The project will provide a solid foundation for motivating key technological developments for future US-based flagship facilities, such as the ngVLA (previous research by this group motivated one of its key science goals). Compared to previous work, this project will investigate the contribution of fainter galaxies to the gas density over a more complete coverage of cosmic history, including a deeper understanding of statistical and systematic uncertainties for the derivation of physical quantities. A diverse set of hands-on education, research training, and outreach events targeting young children, students at all levels, and the public, including underprivileged communities, will broaden the impact of this research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nWe are studying how gas accumulates in the early Universe to form stars and galaxies. At the earliest times, the Universe was very hot, the gas was fully ionized and interacted very strongly with the light of the Big Bang so that collapse to form stars was impossible. When the Universe expanded and cooled to ~3000 K at the age of 380,000 years, the electrons and protons combined to form hydrogen atoms. Neutral hydrogen no longer interacted with the photons so that it could begin to gravitationally gather at dark matter over densities in the Cosmic Web, where the first stars and galaxies would form. To observe this process at the earliest times is quite challenging. Our investigations pick up the story when the age of the Universe, (AgeUniverse) was about 650 million years, and the first stars and galaxies had already formed. These stars were very massive and had very short (~few million years) lifetimes before they exploded as supernova, spewing the first carbon and oxygen into the Universe. Importantly, this carbon could combine with oxygen to form CO. Excepting molecular hydrogen, CO is the most abundant molecule in the Universe. CO is abundant in molecular clouds from which stars form, and CO rotational line emission from CO is an important coolant that enables clouds to collapse to form stars. Therefore, CO lines emission traces the molecular gas from which stars form.\r\n\n\n\nOnce stars form, starlight from hot stars will photodissociate CO and ionize the carbon into C+. Very hot massive stars will ionize oxygen to O++. C+ and O++ have powerful cooling lines at 158 um and 88 um wavelengths respectively. These two lines therefore make excellent probes of the numbers of newly minted stars and the relative fraction of the stars that are very hot and massive.\r\n\n\n\nA key unknown in the models for the formation massive galaxies in the Universe is: do they form from the top-down  meaning do they form by accreting gas from the Cosmic Web and then fragment off smaller systems? Or do they form from the bottom-up  meaning do they form by the assembly of smaller galaxies?\r\n\n\n\nWe have approached this question in several ways. In an early effort under this award, led by Dominik Riechers, we undertook deep surveys in CO rotational lines with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the Very Large Array (VLA) observatories. These surveys picked out individual sources down to low flux levels and hinted at an unexpected preponderance of low luminosity systems thereby suggesting that the bottom-up scenario is appropriate. \r\n\n\n\nWe also engage in detailed investigations of particularly interesting sources using facilities such as the Herschel Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in combination with ALMA observations. The multi-wavelength power of these facilities enables exciting discoveries. Our most challenging ones are that (1) the oxygen abundance in the SPT0418-47, an extremely luminous star-forming galaxy at redshift 4.2  AgeUniverse ~1.4 billion years has very high oxygen abundance indicating continuous and high efficiency star formation from its creation; (2) there is a gas cloud enveloping a star forming galaxy/quasar system at redshift 2.8 (AgeUniverse ~2.3 billion years) with very bright O++ line emission. This indicates that highly oxygen enriched gas is flowing into (or out of) the galaxy. These two works together favor the top-down formation scenario where the gas for new growth is accreted from the Cosmic Web. However, it remains quite remarkable that so much oxygen could have built up in the cosmic web so long ago  a puzzle that our team and others are eagerly trying to solve!\r\n\n\nThe science outlined above comes from detailed, high spatial resolution observations. However, a key element in galaxy formation is the process of accumulation of matter onto the Cosmic Web, where, when densities get high enough galaxy formation occurs. The size scales from one density peak across the void to the next density peak are ~20 Mpc. Measuring such large features requires surveying 2o or larger fields. This cannot be done with pointed observations. It needs a dedicated survey telescope. We have built the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST) and will soon field our Epoch of Reionization Spectrometer on FYST. The combination enables wide-field and deep surveys that are necessary to reveal the evolution of galaxy formation over cosmic time and its link to the underlying grow in structure of the Cosmic Web. Our survey runs from AgeUniverse ~500 million years through the peak of star formation activity in the Universe about 3 billion years later. To detect the very weak CO, C+ and O++ line signals presents a challenge. Our work within this grant has addressed this challenge by supporting the meticulous planning activities that will maximize science returns from the dedicated EoR-Spec/FYST surveys.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/06/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: GordonJStacey\n"
