 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate and efficient prediction of the mechanical behavior of materials under extreme conditions is becoming increasingly crucial for the design of novel materials that address the grand challenges in security, energy and health. The examples range from micron-sized solder joints in micro-chips to crucial structural parts of airplanes. Localized plastic (i.e. irreversible) deformations that the material develops under cyclic loading represent the most typical route to the loss of performance and material's failure. Recently, lattices of connected springs became widely used to model plastic deformations of modern materials under cyclic loading. However, only elastic (i.e. reversible) deformations of lattice spring models can be controlled within the currently available theory. This award supports the development of a mathematical theory with the capability to predict and influence the asymptotic behavior of lattice spring models that are allowed to deform both elastically and plastically (termed elastoplastically). The new mathematical framework will provide a revolutionary tool to accelerate computation of the regions where the plastic deformations concentrate (known to cause crack initialization) and will make it computationally feasible to design materials with superior service lifetime. The designed materials (e.g., super fatigue resistant alloys) can be eventually manufactured to impact such industries as aerospace, automobile, microelectronics and biomedical. Therefore, the results from this research will benefit the U.S. society and national security. The multi-disciplinary collaboration will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact mathematical and engineering education.\r\n\r\nDifferential equations with moving polyhedral constraints (commonly known as sweeping processes) will be used to model the lattices of elastoplastic springs under cyclic loading. By developing a theory of stability and bifurcations for sweeping processes, this project will identify the mechanical parameters of lattice spring models that ensure a unique periodic response (finite-time stable or asymptotic) or co-existing periodic responses (isolated or not) to a cyclic loading given. The dynamical behavior found will be used to efficiently compute the asymptotic distribution of plastic deformations. The performance of this tool will be demonstrated by applying it to the design of such heterogeneous materials for which the distribution of plastic deformations (in the response to cyclic loading) stays as uniform as possible. In this design, the Volume-Compensated Lattice-Particle method will be utilized to map the digital representation of the material microstructure to a lattice spring model. The design will be experimentally validated using 3D-printed sample composite materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
