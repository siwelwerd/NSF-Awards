Over time, it is easy to imagine this network growing so large that referring to individual computers becomes next to impossible.  Instead, one can probe large collections and ask questions like \"how many labels do I need so that no two connected computers receive the same label?\"  This parameter, called the chromatic number of the graph, can change depending upon the complexity of the algorithms allowed to produce the labeling.  Such parameters have (often surprising) connections with other areas of mathematics -- including combinatorial and geometric group theory, probability theory, and operator algebras -- and a secondary aim of this project is to strengthen these connections in addition to forging new ones.\r\n\r\nMore precise proposed areas of study within this general setting include: (a) existence of measurable vertex colorings, edge colorings, and matchings, and subforests, (b) applications to structurability of measured equivalence relations, in particular those arising as orbit equivalence relations of probability-measure-preserving actions of locally compact Polish groups, (c) applications to finding measurable tilings of group actions, and (d) applications towards characterizing paradoxical decompositions.  Particular attention will be paid to ergodic-theoretic applications of this study, connecting algebraic properties of an acting group with measurable combinatorial properties of its associated graphed equivalence relation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Such parameters have (often surprising) connections with other areas of mathematics -- including combinatorial and geometric group theory, probability theory, and operator algebras -- and a secondary aim of this project was to strengthen these connections in addition to forging new ones.\n\nIn addition to supporting travel to conferences and universities for collaboration, this project supported several publications in peer-reviewed journals.  Here are examples of questions considered in these papers:\n\nHow hard it is to divide a sphere into pieces, each of which can be rotated to the others?\n\nHow hard is it to properly color a graph as above so that the same number of vertices receive each color?\n\nHow well do notions of \"dimension\" used by topologists and group theorists generalize to partitions?  Do they correspond to other notions of complexity?\n\nThese questions are formalized and analyzed through the lens of descriptive set theory, a branch of mathematical logic concerned with connecting mathematical properties of objects with the difficulty of their descriptions.   This field is also intimately connected with algorithmic complexity arising in theoretical computer science.\n\nMore broadly, this award has supported mentorship of students in addition to the development of new mathematics.  Gradute and undergraduate courses taught by the PI have incorporated ideas discussed above, reinforcing imporant ideas and communicating the ongoing vitality of mathematics to a new generation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Clinton Conley"
