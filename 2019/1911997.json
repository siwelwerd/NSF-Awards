 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical:\r\nThe Fundamentals of Quantum Materials Winter School is committed to diversity and inclusion, and has been proactive in promoting the participation of underrepresented minorities in Quantum Materials research. Fundamentals of Quantum Materials Winter School, also has an active public outreach effort to share learning materials with members of the public. This workshop will help ensure long-term vigor of Quantum Materials as a research enterprise to allow those activities to continue. The workshop organizers will strive to include a good range of career stages and backgrounds among the participants. This workshop will also strengthen connections within physical science communities, as well as within partners with whom the Fundamentals of Quantum Materials Winter School collaborates. \r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\nBy bringing together leading experts from the U.S. with an interdisciplinary and diverse crowd including physicists, chemists, and materials scientists, participants gain a basic functional knowledge of how to plan and carry out synthesis relevant to the study of quantum materials. In addition, this workshop facilitates a unique experience for participants to interact with some of the top researchers in the field while networking with fellow peers. The structure of the school includes mornings of pedagogical lectures by ten of the nation's top practicing quantum materials scientists, with afternoons devoted to practical demonstrations in laboratories in the University of Maryland's Center for Nanophysics and Advanced Materials. The school also includes a visit to the National Institute of Standards and Technology and a poster session attended by senior scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
