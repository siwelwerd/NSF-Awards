 "awd_abstract_narration": "Operator theory is a broad and mature area of pure mathematics with close ties to the mathematics of quantum mechanics and control systems engineering.  Indeed, von Neumann is often credited with formulating the foundations of operator theory as a language for quantum mechanics, while Nobert Wiener initiated an approach to engineering prediction problems (such as jet tracking) based on ideas from operator theory and harmonic analysis.  In more recent decades, operator theory has been used in H-infinity control theory which has applications in automatic pilot design.  On the other hand, a stable polynomial is not a field per se but a basic concept in mathematics that has become profoundly useful in the study of a diverse range of problems in mathematics: combinatorics (enumeration problems), graph theory (the study of networks), and operator theory.  The purpose of this project is to use operator theory to study stable polynomials and vice versa.  \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on three problems: (1) the generalized Lax conjecture, (2) a quantitative understanding of linear preservers of stability, and (3) extensions of the theory of stable polynomials to entire functions.  Semi-definite programming is a powerful technique in optimization and the generalized Lax conjecture is a bold assertion about the sets on which this theory can successfully be implemented.  The conjecture claims that these feasibility sets have a geometric description in terms of hyperbolic polynomials (a slight generalization of the concept of a stable polynomial).  Although evidently important in optimization, this would further establish links between stable polynomials and operator theory as the question is closely related to the concept of representing stable polynomials via operator theoretic determinantal representations.  Problem (2) is about taking the highly successful theorems of Borcea-Branden that characterized the linear maps on stable polynomials that preserve stability and making them quantitative.  How exactly do stability preservers modify zero sets?  One approach to this problem is through analyzing how stability preservers affect various sums-of-squares formulas for stable polynomials.  Problem (3) is about a natural extension of stable polynomials to various classes of entire functions (the Polya class, Hermite-Biehler class) and would require developing multivariable theories of Hilbert spaces of entire functions.  This latter endeavor is important in its own right as the successes in one variable Hilbert spaces of entire functions have been profound (i.e. the Poltoratski approach to problems of uncertainty type).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFor over a hundred years, mathematicians have exploited a basic  connection between sequential data (such as stock prices, locations of a  moving target, temperature on a thermostat, runtimes of a algorithm as a  function of input size) and properties of functions (such as  polynomials, Fourier series, or power series).  By simply making the  data into the coefficients of a function one can shift problems of  understanding sequential data to that of understanding the properties of  functions where many questions can be made more transparent and a  greater variety of tools become more apparent.  When the data is not  just sequential but perhaps has two or more parameters, one can still  transfer questions to the realm of functions and mathematical analysis  however the mathematics involves multivariable functions.  \n\nThe multivariable functions relevant to this project are so-called  stable polynomials and related rational functions.  Stable polynomials  originated in engineering to describe symbols of differential equations  of electrical engineering where the physical system had stability  properties in a colloquial sense.  These polynomials have since become a surprisingly powerful and flexible tool in a variety of areas including complex analysis, operator theory, combinatorics/computer science, engineering, and  statistics. This grant pursued fundamental research about the abstract properties of stable polynomials.\n\nThe main thread of this research was about a local theory of stable polynomials. Stable polynomials are classes of polynomials with no zeros in a specified region.  A fundamental example of such a class is the real zero polynomials, that is the polynomials with only real zeros such as p(x) = (x-1)(x-2) as compared to the polynomial x2+1 which has no real zeros---it has zeros at the complex numbers i, -i.  The real zero polynomials have no zeros among the complex numbers with the exception of the real numbers.  These examples come from one variable polynomials, while this research focused on multivariable polynomials p(x,y) or p(x,y,z) with no zeros in certain regions.  An example \"region\" is where all the variables are all less than 1 in magnitude.  While these polynomials have no zeros in a given region they may have a zero on the boundary of the region. \n\nThere are many applications where understanding or giving a local description of stable polynomials near a boundary zero is of interest.  The main result of this research was a complete local description of the most important class of stable polynomials in two variables near a boundary singularity.  The description is complicated and necessarily so.  At the same time, this research uncovered a way to replace the given polynomial with a simpler polynomial that carries all of the same local properties at the expense of some of the global properties.  A key application of this work was a complete characterization of fundamental classes of rational functions in two variables (specifically, rational functions in two variables (x,y) that are analytic in the region |x|,|y|&lt;1 and bounded in this region as well as a similar class where boundedness is replaced bu square integrability on the boundary).  The local theory of stable polynomials should prove useful in even more contexts such as analytic combinatorics in several variables, where the nature of singularities of rational functions in more than one variable is crucial in understanding the certain enumeration problems with multiple parameters.\n\nA second thread of this research was conducted by Dr. Jeet Sampat as part of his PhD thesis supervised by the PI.  This work involved a natural generalization of stable polynomial, called a cyclic function, in the context of a field called operator theory. This work focused on the study of linear operators that preserve cyclic functions as an analogue of seminal work about linear operators that preserve stable polynomials.\n\nA third thread of this research was on simplifying and extending the construction of special sums of squares formulas for stable polynomials.  A simplified version of the idea of sums of squares formula is that one can express the defining property of a stable polynomial (i.e. non-vanishing in a certain region) in terms of an algebraic property---such as the polynomial equals a sum of squares times polynomials known to be non-vanishing on the region in question.  There is a well-known sum of squares formula for stable polynomials in two variables that has proven extremely useful in contructing formulas for stable polynomials and associated rational functions however the constructions in the past were complicated.  In this research we simplified and extended a known method of constructing these formulas to the context of matrix valued functions.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/23/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Greg Knese"
