 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2019, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  This study examines how the diet of an animal can help it survive attacks from other animals.  The Fellow studies the fall webworm, a caterpillar that eats the leaves of different trees.  Fall webworms are attacked by parasitic insects that lay their eggs inside the caterpillar and use it as a host.  The caterpillar's immune system can help defend against these parasitic insects, but the strength of the immune system can be affected by the caterpillar's diet.  The Fellow uses experiments and field surveys in Colorado to understand whether different trees increase the immunity of the fall webworm against wasp attacks.  The survival of insects, like many animals, is dependent on the plants in their habitat.  As changes in climate transform many plant communities, insects are likely to be affected too. This study will increase understanding of how plant-insect interactions might change if major climatic events drastically modify plant communities.  In addition, the Fellow works closely with youth from underrepresented minority students from urban areas in Denver.  Students will participate in wildlife surveys, which increase awareness of wildlife. The fellow will also promote opportunities for mentorship and guidance by creating an online network of biologists from minority backgrounds who will advise high school students. \r\n\r\nFor widely distributed animals, the relative importance of diet and natural enemies can vary depending on location and composition of ecological communities.  The Fellow will use genomics to identify and quantify the diversity of parasitic insects attacking fall webworm across its range in Colorado. Next, the Fellow will use lab experiments to measure the relationship between diet and the nutrient quality of fall webworms.  Finally, the Fellow will manipulate the caterpillar's diet to examine how different tree species impact the caterpillar's ability to launch immune defenses against parasitic insects.  This research includes two approaches to increase interactions with nature among underrepresented minority students in urban public schools. First, the Fellow will use an experiential learning model to create interactive out-of-school learning opportunities for middle school students. Second, the Fellow will build an online network of professional biologists who agree to be mentors for high school students with interests in biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Insects have survived for millions of years even though they are eaten by other animals, which means that they have found ways to get food while escaping enemies.  However, some insects eat only a few specific items, while other insects eat many different types of food.  So, what determines the diversity of an insect?s diet?  As an ecologist and NSF Postdoctoral Fellow, I studied whether an insect?s diet protects the insect from an enemy.  Some of the most common insect enemies are other insects, many of which attack and lay their eggs inside a host that eventually dies from the attack.  The host insect can defend itself through its immune system, which can be enhanced or weakened by the insect?s diet.  Therefore, the diets of an insect might be shaped by the threat it faces from its enemies. To answer this question, I studied the fall webworm caterpillars in Colorado where they eat over 10 different types of plants.  The fall webworm caterpillars are attacked by parasitic wasps and parasitic flies that use the caterpillars as a host.  My first goal was to identify the diversity of fall webworm enemies in Colorado, and I found that fall webworm caterpillars are attacked by at least 10 species of parasitic wasps and 4 species of parasitic flies.  Next, I conducted an experiment to determine if different plant diets affect the fall webworm caterpillar?s ability to defend against a parasitic wasp.  I found that apple tree leaves were the worst diet because the caterpillars grew the smallest, and their immune system was the weakest at defending against the parasitic wasp.  The next step is to calculate if the threat of parasitism is greater in some parts of Colorado, and if so, do the fall webworms eat specific plants in these regions.  I suspect that when the enemy threat is low, fall webworms might have a more diverse diet, including apple.  However, if the enemy pressure is high, then perhaps the fall webworms eat only plants that are beneficial to their immune defenses against enemies.\n\nBiology has traditionally lacked racial diversity because of many factors, but I sought to address two of these factors.  First, many children from minority racial backgrounds fail to have hands-on experiences with nature that could ignite a curiosity about biology.  Second, there are few non-white scientists who serve as role models for underrepresented minority children.
