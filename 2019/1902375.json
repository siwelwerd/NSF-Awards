 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Central Workforce Region of Virginia is experiencing a shortage of adequately trained manufacturing technicians due to the growing demand for workers coupled with growing rate of retirements. This region is also exceptional in that local manufacturers employ Rockwell Automation-based systems at a higher rate than nearby regions. Through this project, Central Virginia Community College (CVCC) will increase the rigor and competencies of manufacturing technician education in mechatronics with an emphasis on programmable logic controllers (PLCs). This project will focus on augmenting the Mechatronics AAS degree program at CVCC with Rockwell Automation PLC Maintainer Certifications. These certifications are industry recognized and valued by employers. Through targeted outreach, the mechatronics program will work closely with regional secondary school systems and local advanced manufacturing industries to provide middle-school students with the opportunity to directly experience mechatronics and advanced manufacturing. This will build a pipeline to the college to develop and train the workers needed to sustain and grow the sector.\r\n\r\nThis project will support mechatronics technician training for the growing advanced manufacturing industry by 1) enhancing course content and technical experiences for students, 2) providing comprehensive professional development for technician educators, and 3) developing educational pathways to support student recruitment, retention, and completion from middle school to college. New equipment and revised courses will strengthen the students' career pathway from the career studies certificate to the associate degree and into the workforce. Faculty will receive professional development in areas that directly impact technician education by providing the training necessary to offer certification testing on the purchased training equipment. Industry employers will engage with the program and its students in an integrated advisory role. Middle school students and college students will be engaged in collaborative learning opportunities to attract new talent and sustain the mechatronics technician pipeline through summer camp opportunities and joint problem-based learning projects. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The Mechatronics discipline is by nature equipment and faculty training-heavy, and community colleges are hard-pressed to fund set-up costs. Advanced manufacturing employers serving on the Mechatronics advisory board highly valued Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) content and certification. This award improved advanced manufacturing technician education by providing faculty training, Rockwell Automation (RA) software and services, and four certification trainers necessary for students to earn the RA PLC Maintainer I industry certification. To date, 86 students have completed the credit-bearing ETR 150 Machine Control Using Relay &amp; Programmable Logic course, and approximately 50 students have earned the RA industry certification.</p>\n<p>The PLC course quickly gained popularity and notoriety among local advanced manufacturing employers. As a result, advisory boards of two additional AAS degree programs, (1) Computer and Electronics Technology?Computer Networking and (2) Nuclear Technology?Mechatronics requested the course be added to those programs. Students obtaining the certification are quickly hired (&gt;90%), most even before graduation.</p>\n<p>To increase classroom time for practical, hands-on programming exercises where students write PLC code to control mechatronic processes (such as conveyor control) in the laboratory, the award supported the development of eleven free, public-access certification content training videos. The videos provide a flipped classroom option for the certification material, leaving more time for hands-on learning. Employers have verified the effectiveness of the approach and appreciate the hands-on skills and certification that students gain. As a result, industry partners readily contribute additional laboratory equipment when needed, such as sensors and switches.</p>\n<p>Since the award, CVCC has provided increased support for the Mechatronics degree program in several ways: A second full-time Mechatronics faculty member was added to handle the increase in enrollment in the degree programs improved by the award; During pandemic shutdowns, the grant team developed a laptop loaner program to enable students to continue their study remotely (the laptops were necessary because the industry-proprietary RA software is licensed on college computers only); CVCC?s relevant marketing budgets were earmarked for the promotion of the Mechatronics AAS degree program; and the Mechatronics program is prominently displayed and actively promoted at Open House events and secondary school visits. The success of the project, combined with CVCC?s strong support of associated programs contributed to the award of follow-on ATE project Improving Advanced Manufacturing Technician Education Using Industry Partnerships (#2202015) for $464,846.00 which will work to recruit and support adjunct faculty from industry partners and add Industrial Robotics Programming to several degree pathways.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Broader Impacts:</h2>\n<p>Over the award period, industry partnerships increased from 15 minimally supportive to over 50 highly engaged and strongly supportive companies. The Mechatronics (and other grant-improved) degree programs have earned a stellar reputation in the regional industrial community. The pipeline for students to work is so strong that the program director is regularly contacted for student resumes beyond the capacity to supply them. The PIs have conducted multiple sessions at state and national conferences to disseminate their successful industry engagement practices.</p>\n<p>The project collaborated with several other colleges and NSF ATE projects and centers, including: Central Piedmont Community College, Macomb CC, Rowan-Cabarrus CC, Montcalm CC, Randolph College, University of Lynchburg, Liberty University, Hofstra University, TRACKS-CN (#2000867), Needed Math (#1737946), FLATE, SCATE, NextGen Manufacturing, and CORD. Collaborations resulted in seminar presentations, support for industry and student-focused events at CVCC, development of course material and degree programs, development of a support network, and dissemination of results.</p>\n<p>The development of new partnerships with two local poverty-fighting organizations is perhaps the most important impact of the project. In cooperation with Beacon of Hope, each semester the grant team traveled to local high schools with activities and information for students about dual-enrolled and post-high school Mechatronics opportunities. Summer camps brought Mechatronics exploration experiences to middle and high schoolers each summer, both on CVCC?s campus and as a roadshow when students were unable to travel. The grant team interacted with over 500 8<sup>th</sup> graders in groups of five and six at a time at one event in 2021, with engaging, hands-on Mechatronics activities. With planning and instructional support from the grant team, The Jubilee Family Development Center opened The Astronaut Leland Melvin STEM Center with an emphasis on Mechatronics education. CVCC established the location as an Offsite Center offering credit-bearing courses in Mechatronics.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Mechatronics and other AAS degree programs at CVCC improved by this award are regularly cited by the Lynchburg Regional Business Alliance, the Bedford County Office of Economic Development, and other regional economic development boards as incentives to attract new industries to the region. The NSF ATE program, and specifically this award, have greatly contributed to the economic health of the region and the well-being of many individuals and families.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/09/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Marcella&nbsp;Gale</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902375/1902375_10618900_1678385566701_ATEPIConference2022--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902375/1902375_10618900_1678385566701_ATEPIConference2022--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ATEPI Conference 2022 in Washington, D.C.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902375/1902375_10618900_1678385566701_ATEPIConference2022--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ATEPI Conference 2022 in Washington, D.C.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PI Marcella Gale and Co-PI Danny Murphy attending the ATEPI Conference in Washington, D.C. in October, 2022.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marcella Gale</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marcella&nbsp;Gale</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ATEPI Conference 2022 in Washington, D.C.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902375/1902375_10618900_1678385043012_8thGradeSymposium2022--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902375/1902375_10618900_1678385043012_8thGradeSymposium2022--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"8th Grade Symposium 2022 sponsored by Beacon of Hope\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1902375/1902375_10618900_1678385043012_8thGradeSymposium2022--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"8th Grade Symposium 2022 sponsored by Beacon of Hope\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Outreach event sponsored by Beacon of Hope which featured CVCC's Mechatronics Roadshow.
