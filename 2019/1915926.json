 "awd_abstract_narration": "The international conference, titled Model Theory and Mathematical Logic, will take place at the University of Maryland College Park on June 21st to June 23rd, 2019.  The main purpose of this conference is to bring together many leading researchers in the field of model theory from around the world.  The conference is expected to consist of approximately seventeen talks over the span of three days.  Although the talks will generally be aimed for logicians, some of these talks will be accessible to researchers outside of mathematical logic.  Furthermore, a poster session is planned at the conference where students and early career researchers can present their work.  \r\n\r\nThe conference aims to focus on areas of model theory which have not been the emphasis of any major conference in North America for the last several years.  The main topics that may be covered in the conference include: stability theory, simplicity theory, and neo-stability theory; model theory and computability theory; model theory and combinatorics; model theory in non-first order contexts; and model theory and set theory.  More information about this conference can be found on the conference website, http://www.umdlogic2019.com/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
