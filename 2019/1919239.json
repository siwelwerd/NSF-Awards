 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to enable broad adoption of technologies used for carbon-free production of hydrogen, and fuel cells that use hydrogen to generate power for vehicles and industrial applications. The project involves extensive engagement with potential customers for the new material under development to advance the commercialization pathway. The economical materials under development will enable conversion of wasted heat into efficiency gains. This new technology will reduce system cost and complexity by enabling less stringent requirements on several aspects of the fuel cell system. Students engaged in the project and the broader community will benefit from the learning involved in this process through outreach and mentorship programs involving the principal investigator.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop composite membranes comprising thermally stable polymers with embedded ceramic nanocrystals; these composites have been demonstrated to exhibit unusual protonic conductivity at elevated temperature and low humidity. Considering that thermal and water management systems impose substantial constraints, complexity, and cost on hydrogen energy systems, these characteristics offer a substantial opportunity to more broadly deploy clean energy technologies. The research plan includes a systematic investigation of the properties of nanocomposite membranes, varying their composition - including each of the components and the volume fraction of each - to strategically understand the impact on relevant properties including conductivity, gas permeability, and mechanical integrity. To enable these efforts, the research plan also involves development of membrane fabrication techniques relevant for nanocomposite membranes at the lab scale and also facilitating the translation to industrial scale, cost-effective manufacturing. Both the performance metrics assessed and the fabrication strategies employed in the course of the project will be informed by industry and commercialization experts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
