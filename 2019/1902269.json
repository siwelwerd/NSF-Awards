 "awd_abstract_narration": "The annual Phenome 2019 Conference will be held February 6-9, 2019 in Tucson, Arizona . The conference is designed to accelerate U.S. research in the emerging field of phenomics, defined as an interdisciplinary science that allows for in-depth and rapid analysis of plant traits and their response to the environment at an agricultural scale. The conference highlights cutting-edge engineering, sensing and robotic technologies that help plant scientists understand how genome sequences and environmental influences impact plant traits of interest. The four-day meeting will feature plenary talks, technical and networking sessions, and it will provide opportunities for meaningful engagement among plant and crop scientists, engineers and computational scientists. The interdisciplinary meeting is a joint effort of the National Plant Science Council (NPSC), the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB) and the North American Plant Phenotyping Network (NAPPN). With NSF support, the conference will continue to attract early career researchers and participants from groups underrepresented in science. The outcomes will be publications in a special journal issue of a relevant journal highlighting advances in phenomics at the interface of  biology and engineering.  The long-term outcomes will be the establishment of a critical interdisciplinary community in research that increases U.S. agricultural competitiveness and ensures food security now and into the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
