 "awd_abstract_narration": "Liquid lithography is a promising, versatile, and accessible method for generating three-dimensional (3D) microstructures using standard lithography instrumentation. Extending and simplifying the fabrication process of 3D microstructures will advance a wide variety of technologies such as organ-on-a-chip devices, tissue engineering, microfluidics, optics and microelectronics. This team will develop a liquid lithography process that can be used for a variety of important applications.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a predictive mathematical model for the diffusion and deposition of silane in a rectangular chamber geometry. Furthermore,by modifying the geometry of the external chamber surrounding the substrate, the passive diffusion process of the silane can be further tuned, allowing for greatly enhanced control of the spatial distribution of the substrate?s surface properties. The investigators will develop, analyze, and benchmark an accessible mathematical model for a critical stage of the process. They will recruit and directly supervise students with particular attention to students from underrepresented backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
