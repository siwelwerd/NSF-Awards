 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to visualize, break, and make individual chemical bonds with control and selectivity in space and time would significantly advance modern chemical science. A thorough description of the weak interactions associated with the forces between molecules remains challenging. With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Wilson Ho and Professor Ruqian Wu at the University of California-Irvine carry out laboratory and computational research that seeks a deeper understanding of chemical interactions within and between molecules on metal surfaces at very low pressures. By taking information gained from experiments using a microscope that can give images of molecules with sub-atom precision (\"itProbe\") and using it in parallel with computer-aided visualization and simulation methods, Dr. Ho's team is probing the basic interactions between molecules and how those weak interactions are impacted by conditions that typically lead to changes in chemical properties, such as heat and light. Not only is the research area diverse from an expertise point of view, but the project team is dedicated to training of a wide array of researchers from many backgrounds, including undergraduates, with a focus on the recruitment of female and underrepresented students. Outreach activities are organized through the University of California-Irvine, with opportunities to work with Hispanic communities, particularly middle school students in underserved communities in southern California. Results from the research have potential for being shared via educational resources that impact a wide spectrum of users.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will provide direct visualization of chemical interactions between atoms and molecules. The integration of experimental measurements and density functional theory calculations for static and dynamic properties enables the visualization, manipulation, and control of the quantum properties in space and time of molecular systems. Such basic understandings open up opportunities for the realization of practical molecular functionalities. Results from the proposed research are of technological importance, including catalysis, energy conversion, environmental management, molecular recognition, and quantum information processing. The proposed research addresses the spatial and temporal evolutions of chemical systems by measuring and imaging time-dependent phenomena. In this way, it becomes possible to visualize, manipulate, and coherently control the molecular properties to implement quantum functionalities. Furthermore, the proposed research manipulates the positions of adsorbed molecules with the microscope to enable the construction of novel nanostructures that are not possible by other means and to provide real-space visualization of the temporal evolution of chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As the number of atoms and electrons increased, the behavior of chemical system became harder to understand without knowing its structure through direct visualization of the chemical bonds and accurate knowledge of the excitations and energy levels. In consideration of the many-electron problem, the presence of different chemical bonds, from the weak van der Waals bonds to the strong covalent bonds, imposed particular challenges for experiment and theory to appropriately characterize them because of the diverge energy and length scales. Furthermore, typical intramolecular and intermolecular interactions had electron densities that varied at the subatomic scale. The goals in this research used recently developed inelastic tunneling probe (itProbe) to image the skeletal structure of individual molecules and the relatively weaker bonds that bound molecules together to form increasingly extended structures in self-assembly. These weak bonds included the van der Waals force, the hydrogen bond, and the halogen bond. In contrast to the stronger covalent bonds, multiplicity in bonding occurred for the weak bonds, including bifurcation in the hydrogen bond and interactions with multiple neighbors in the van der Waals and the halogen bonds. Real space imaging by the itProbe provided direct visualization of the unexpected multiplicity in the weak bonds. These results led to new understanding into the nature of the chemical interactions in molecular systems in chemistry, biology, and materials. In addition, these studies stimulated the development of terahertz (THz) spectroscopic and imaging techniques to probe low energies and excitations of these weak chemical bonds.
