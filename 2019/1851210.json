 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several regions of the deep ocean naturally contain almost no oxygen.  Because of this lack of oxygen, microbes living in these regions live in ways that differ from those in oxygenated waters consuming nitrate ions instead of oxygen for respiration.  Use of nitrate for microbial respiration results in the production of nitrogen gas which is called denitrification.  The resulting removal of nitrate has consequences for the whole ocean as nitrogen is an important nutrient controlling plant growth; however, whereas plants can use nitrogen in the form of nitrate, they cannot, with a few exceptions, use nitrogen gas. There remains a number of uncertainties regarding how much denitrification occurs in the ocean, what controls it, and how it varies in time and space.  Traditional studies of ocean denitrification have been limited by the time ships can be at sea and the relatively small proportion of the ocean they can observe.  Our project plans to remedy this problem by using vehicles called floats that can operate autonomously in the ocean for three years or more as they drift with currents over hundreds of kilometers.  We will outfit ten floats with sensors to measure oxygen and nitrogen gas which will be placed throughout the oxygen depleted region of the Pacific Ocean to the west of Mexico.  This is the largest such region in the ocean from which we have two years of results from a prototype float which validated our approach.  This study may well transform our understanding of ocean denitrification and ultimately benefit society as a whole through greater confidence in predictions of the ocean's nitrogen cycle and capacity to fix carbon dioxide under current and future conditions.  Application and further development of float systems using commercially available technology will directly benefit successor studies, and more broadly showcase the use of water-following platforms to tackle difficult oceanographic problems. Advances from this study are expected to carry over to other disciplines including ocean biogeochemical modeling.  Outreach activities, support for an early career scientist, and student training are included in the project.  For the outreach activities, the investigators plan to tie into well-established after-school programs serving underrepresented populations in Massachusetts and established opportunities for public presentations using float related display materials at the University of Washington.  \r\n\r\nOxygen deficient zones (ODZs), despite constituting a small fraction of total oceanic volume, play important roles in regulating global ocean carbon and nitrogen cycles including hosting 30 to 50% of the global loss of fixed nitrogen. Unfortunately, current uncertainty in ODZ nitrogen loss derives from substantial temporal and spatial variability in rates that remain under-sampled by ship-based measurements. While local regulation of nitrogen loss by oxygen and organic matter availability are well accepted, temporal/spatial variability in the nitrogen flux is likely a result of the influence of physical forcings such as remote ventilation, seasonal variability, and mesoscale eddies. Understanding how the impact of physical forcings on nitrogen loss as mediated through oxygen and organic flux will be required to fully understand the causes and consequences of any future ODZ expansion. To improve our understanding of ODZ nitrogen loss, we will carry out a multiyear, autonomous float-based observational program to address outstanding questions regarding bioavailable nitrogen loss in ODZs.  As the largest ODZ and region of our pilot deployments, our operation area will be the Eastern Tropical N. Pacific (ETNP) where our study will determine over a multi-year period, in-situ nM-level oxygen and biogenic nitrogen on float profiles spanning geographic gradients in oxygen and surface productivity. For the first time, our study will also determine in situ nitrogen loss rates from changes in nitrogen  concentration during 1 to 2 week Lagrangian float drifts along a constant density surface. A pilot 2 yr float deployment in the ETNP documents our ability to do so. Critically, our float-based approach more closely matches the frequency and distribution of observations to the expected variability in biogenic nitrogen production as compared to prior work and will dramatically increase the data density for this region by acquiring >500 profiles/drifts for nitrogen and >1000 profiles for nM oxygen.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
