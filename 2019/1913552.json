 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.  Observations of astrophysical gamma rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, can be used to test fundamental physics, and play a key role in multi-messenger astrophysics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high energy gamma rays.  VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources.  This award provides funding to continue VERITAS operations.  During this time the Observatory will implement a program designed to address key science drivers in Galactic and extragalactic physics, as well as themes in multi-messenger and time-domain astrophysics. This award also provides resources to initially operate a novel prototype telescope co-located with VERITAS and will be used to verify its performance and optimize its final design. This prototype is intended for use in the next-generation gamma-ray observatory, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).  This award will also support the VERITAS collaboration efforts to engage the public in science. These include collaboration with the Whipple Observatory Visitors Center to promote VERITAS science to the public, other educators, museum professionals and the wider community.  \r\n \r\nVERITAS is an array of four 12-meter atmospheric-Cherenkov telescopes. VERITAS seeks both to identify new sources of high energy gamma rays and to perform in-depth studies of the known sources to better understand their underlying fundamental processes. The VERITAS Galactic catalog includes supernova remnants, pulsars, binary systems, the Galactic Center and sources whose classification is unknown. VERITAS's  extragalactic catalog includes active galactic nuclei, radio galaxies, and starburst galaxies. VERITAS multi-messenger programs include searches for transient emission from sources associated with IceCube neutrino events, gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave signals.  Beyond the source physics, VERITAS studies address questions related to dark matter, cosmic-ray origin and acceleration, and cosmology, among others.  This work directly addresses the goals of NSF's \"Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics\" Big Idea.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
