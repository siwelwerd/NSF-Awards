 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemical Instrumentation Programs. Professor Andrew Sykes from the University of South Dakota (USD) and colleagues Haoran Sun and Zhenqiang Wang are acquiring a dual-source single-crystal diffractometer. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this and other collaborating institutions. Because this is the only diffraction facility in the state it serves as a regional resource. The diffractometer also enables training of undergraduates at regional colleges and tribal schools with whom the home institution has long-established relationships through Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs. The instrument is also used extensively in the education and training of underrepresented students such as Native American students from Nebraska Indian Community College (NICC, in South Sioux City, Macy and Santee, NE) who participate in summer research at USD.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It is especially useful for studying  the absolute structure of steroids and for analyzing inorganic near-infrared active dyes with potential biomedical applications. The diffractometer is also employed to determine the structure of amphiphilic (detergent-like) molecules used in carbon-fluorine catalysis. The instrument is utilized in studies of anion sensors, fluorescent pressure sensors and anthraquinone-imine cation fluorescent sensors. It is also employed to characterize perfluoroalkylated transition metal complexes and metal-organic supercontainers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
