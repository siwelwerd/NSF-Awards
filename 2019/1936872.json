 "awd_abstract_narration": "The large-scale use of hybrid seeds over the past century has contributed to a revolution in agriculture.  Hybrid crop plants produce high yields, but due to genetic segregation, their progeny have variable and frequently low yields.  This means that hybrid seeds have to be generated afresh for every season, using labor-intensive methods such as hand pollination, resulting in substantially higher costs.  Consequently, hybrids are underutilized for many crops, especially by farmers in developing countries.  Recently a technology called synthetic apomixis has been developed to enable hybrid rice plants to produce seeds that are genetic clones of the parent plant, such that the progeny can produce the same high yields as the parent plant.  The method mimics a process called apomixis that occurs naturally in many asexual plant species, and utilizes genome editing together with manipulation of gene expression to bypass both genetic segregation and fertilization.  In this project, the method for clonal propagation of hybrid seeds developed for the monocot plant rice will be modified and tested for use in tomato, which is a dicot species.  If successful in tomato, the method can be extended to other major crops that are dicots, such as soybean and cotton, with correspondingly large impacts on world agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe first successful propagation of clonal seeds by a sexually reproducing plant has been recently achieved in rice, through the elimination of meiosis by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing of three meiotic genes, followed by parthenogenesis arising from egg cell expression of an embryogenic transcription factor of the BABY BOOM family. The resulting seeds were clonal and maintained the genome wide heterozygosity of the parent plant. A similar approach will be used in this project on the dicot plant tomato, to enable the propagation of hybrid tomato plants clonally through seeds.  Tomato orthologs of the highly conserved meiosis genes REC8, PAIR1 and OSD1 will be genome edited by CRISPR-Cas9 to eliminate meiosis and form unreduced gametes. Parthenogenesis of the unreduced egg cell will be induced by ectopic expression of candidate embryogenic factors identified by orthology to embryonic factors in rice and Arabidopsis, including those of the BABY BOOM transcription factor family.  Putative clonal progeny will be identified by their chromosomal ploidy, and validated by whole genome sequencing to confirm maintenance of parental heterozygosity in their genomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, due to genetic segregation hybrid seeds have to be generated afresh for each season using labor-intensive methods, resulting in high costs of production. Consequently, the use of hybrids is not widespread for many major crops, including tomato and rice. If crops could be propagated as hybrids through their seeds, it would substantially lower costs of hybrid production for seed companies and farmers, and help meet the challenges of feeding the world with limited arable land. Recently, the first such seed propagation of a crop plant as a hybrid was achieved through asexual reproduction, by the activation of an embryo inducing gene called BabyBoom1 in female gametes called egg cells, combined with elimination of meiosis through gene editing. That work was performed in rice, a monocot plant and a major crop. In this project, the technology was adapted and developed for asexual propagation of tomato, which is a dicot plant and also a major crop. The limiting step was the induction of embryos from egg cells, a process that is not well understood in dicot plants. It was found that the tomato BabyBoom genes could not induce embryos in tomato seeds at detectable frequencies. A candidate embryonic gene from a gene family called Wox9 (Wuschel-related homeobox9) was then tested, alone and in combination with BabyBoom, for embryo induction, but these experiments also did not produce asexual embryos in tomato. However, experiments conducted in parallel in rice showed that the rice version of Wox9 called Dwt1/Wox9A, when combined with BabyBoom1, resulted in embryo induction at frequencies over 90%, representing a four to fifteen fold increase when compared to BabyBoom1 alone. The high embryo induction frequency achieved in this project is likely to be applicable to other cereals. It provides the feasibility for the translation to field applications of this new technology for hybrid propagation, which would substantially lower the costs of hybrid seeds in rice, as well as other cereal crops.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/07/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: VenkatesanSundaresan\n"
