 "awd_abstract_narration": "While most wetlands and ponds are physically isolated, their communities are linked over years and long distances, through a process called \"teleconnections.\" These exchanges occur via atmospheric processes, temporary aquatic connections, natural 'hitchhiking' on other migrating animals, and dispersal by humans. Aquatic systems where these can be studied include Great Plains ephemeral wetlands. These systems, such as playas and prairie potholes, are abundant in grassland ecoregions and support resident invertebrate species, amphibians, and migrating waterfowl. Their ephemeral nature requires residents to periodically seek other aquatic systems or produce resistant eggs that allow them to survive dry periods lasting months to decades. Their 'signature' species are tiny fairy and tadpole shrimps. These lay resistant eggs which can be dispersed by 'wind and wing.' The former includes egg transport by prevailing Great Plains winds, and the latter by eggs hitching rides in the guts of migrating waterfowl to be deposited later in other wetlands. The research will manipulate community composition in outdoor tanks to determine competitive abilities of invertebrates from different sites and to check for migrating branchiopods in the digestive tracts of waterfowl shot by hunters. The project will use this accessible system to develop ecology programs for K-6th grade students; employing young students in science studies; educating under-served student populations, including Native Americans and students from our Hispanic Serving Institution; and working on wetlands-focused conservation.\r\n\r\nThe research will focus on the question: how do teleconnections (dispersal by wind and wing) and climatic factors influence macroinvertebrate community composition and synchrony (temporal links) in ephemeral ponds within a macrosystem network? This project will test 6 hypotheses on factors shaping community composition that are related to: strong dispersal, geographically variable dispersal, strong climatic synchrony, geographically variable climatic synchrony, equal roles for dispersal and climate, and a null hypothesis on stochasticity. The study will be 25 sites in the greater region, including 5 sites within the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). The study will consist of: (1) sampling pond invertebrate densities and diversities; (2) analyzing genetic signatures of branchiopod crustacean populations; (3) conducting tank experiments on community assembly; (4) obtaining data on waterfowl migrating through NEON sites; (5) correlating effects of winds and rainfall on species traits; and (6) extracting, hatching, and identifying crustacean eggs from gut contents analysis of waterfowl. Overall, this research will test the validity of a poorly understood phenomenon, that the biota of systems can be coupled without respect to geographic proximity but instead tele-connected by wind or wing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This is also true of temporary wetlands&mdash;locations in a landscape that periodically have surface water, but completely dry out in between. These wetlands typically lack fish but are filled with interesting and abundant life that can take advantage of the seasonal wetness, such as aquatic insects with flying adults, amphibians, and waterfowl, all of which move across land during some life stage. Another group of animals that is abundant in temporary wetlands&mdash;freshwater crustaceans such as fairy, clam, and tadpole shrimp&mdash;cannot actively move across the land. These animals can form resistant eggs that can survive drying events, but given that many of these wetlands are isolated, lacking strong surface water connections, one might wonder, how do freshwater crustaceans make it to these wetlands in the first place? And how connected are the populations of crustaceans?</p>\n<p>We hypothesized that eggs of freshwater crustaceans would regularly move between temporary wetlands across the US Great Plains due to suspension in the wind or attached to wing feathers, or in the digestive system of migratory waterfowl. And that this regular movement of eggs would mix populations and species, leading to wetlands from different locations having similar species and increased synchrony of populations, despite differences in climate. We examined this question by 1) collecting samples of these crustaceans from temporary wetlands in 5 locations across the US Great Plains (North Dakota, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, and Texas) and examining their communities and testing their genetic connections, 2) collecting dust and waterfowl samples and examining them for viable freshwater crustacean eggs, and 3) conducting experiments in small artificially-created wetlands in 3 states (North Dakota, Kansas, New Mexico) where we added egg-containing sediment collected either from local wetlands only or from a mixture of all 5 locations across the Great Plains.</p>\n<p>Contrary to our hypothesis, our results currently suggest freshwater crustaceans don&rsquo;t commonly move between wetlands. Specifically, when we examined populations of a species of fairy shrimp, they were genetically disconnected. And we were unable to find any viable eggs in dust samples or from extensive bird samples collected each fall of multiple years. In alignment with this idea, the natural wetlands had very different species. However, we did find those species show similar traits that help them deal with wetland drying. The results from the artificially-created wetlands were complex. The wetlands in North Dakota with mixed sediment from all 5 locations had higher diversity and abundances than local sediment, but the Kansas and New Mexico wetlands were less affected by sediment source. This suggests that in addition to limited movement of eggs across the Great Plains, local climate may act as a filter, removing certain species that cannot survive cold temperatures, for instance. Overall, movement of eggs between temporary wetlands of the Great Plains must occur for these species to be so prevalent, but our results suggest that transportation by wind or waterfowl is rare.</p>\n<p>Understanding populations of freshwater crustaceans and the functioning of wetland ecosystems is important in part because migratory waterfowl depend on these wetlands and crustaceans are an important food source. Our results suggest that wetland creations or restorations that do not add sediment from nearby wetlands might lack freshwater crustaceans for prolonged periods. This could have negative consequences for species that eat them and possibly affect other ecosystem functions, such as water quality improvement, in unknown ways. In addition to the potential management implications, the research conducted here also had other societal benefits, such as providing many training opportunities for students and scientists of diverse backgrounds.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/24/2024<br>\nModified by: Kevin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Mccluney</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926555/1926555_10626125_1708813166398_Branchinecta_sp_at_surface_small--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926555/1926555_10626125_1708813166398_Branchinecta_sp_at_surface_small--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fairy Shrimp\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926555/1926555_10626125_1708813166398_Branchinecta_sp_at_surface_small--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fairy Shrimp\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A fairy shrimp in the genus  Branchinecta</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Christopher Frazier</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kevin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Mccluney\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fairy Shrimp</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926555/1926555_10626125_1708813442493_KS_B7_22Jun2022--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926555/1926555_10626125_1708813442493_KS_B7_22Jun2022--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Artificial wetland tank\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926555/1926555_10626125_1708813442493_KS_B7_22Jun2022--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Artificial wetland tank\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">One of the artificial wetland tanks used in experiments</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andrew Karlin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kevin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Mccluney\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Artificial wetland tank</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926555/1926555_10626125_1708812825494_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926555/1926555_10626125_1708812825494_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Temporary Wetland\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926555/1926555_10626125_1708812825494_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Temporary Wetland\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A temporary wetland in North Dakota</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jacob Buchanan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kevin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Mccluney\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Temporary Wetland</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926555/1926555_10626125_1708813229772_Triops_dorsal_on_tank_bottom_small--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926555/1926555_10626125_1708813229772_Triops_dorsal_on_tank_bottom_small--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tadpole shrimp\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926555/1926555_10626125_1708813229772_Triops_dorsal_on_tank_bottom_small--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tadpole shrimp\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A tadpole shrimp</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Christopher Frazier</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kevin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Mccluney\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tadpole shrimp</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926555/1926555_10626125_1708813354217_Map--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926555/1926555_10626125_1708813354217_Map--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Map of study locations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1926555/1926555_10626125_1708813354217_Map--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Map of study locations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Map of study locations</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jacob Buchanan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kevin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Mccluney\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Map of study locations</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
