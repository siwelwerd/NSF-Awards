 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will provide support for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers to attend the 2019 Gordon Research Conference on Chromosome Dynamics (June 23-28, 2019 in Newry, ME). This leading conference in the field brings together researchers from diverse disciplines ranging from mathematics and computing to biology, who are studying chromosome structure/dynamics and function. Three keynote speakers (two established and one junior scientists) will showcase breakthroughs and new directions in the field, and a diverse group of scientists at all career stages will present their work through seminars and poster sessions. Programmatic activities aimed at broader impact include discussion sessions on inclusivity in science and on Rules of Life, one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas. There will also be plenty of informal opportunities for resource sharing and networking.\r\n\r\nNew technology development has accelerated discoveries in chromosome biology in recent years. It has also led to high levels of specialization that have profound impact, but can also hinder fuller understanding of how the biophysical properties of packaged DNA influence the function, maintenance and propagation of the genetic code. This conference serves as a vital link for investigators by facilitating discussion of latest discoveries in topics such as chromosome organization and the impact on gene regulation, DNA replication and repair in the chromosomal context, meiotic chromosomal organization and segregation, as well as centromeres and chromosome stability. It will also facilitate training and career development of the next generation of scientists, including underrepresented minorities, in the field of chromosome biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
