 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program provides support to enhance the research capabilities of minority-serving institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research. With National Science Foundation support, Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU) will build on the accomplishments of their Phase I Center by broadening the research scope of the CREST Phase II Center for Energy and Environmental Sustainability research and further integrating energy-related education, outreach, and research. Phase II Center research is organized around three subprojects: bioenergy, wind energy, and environmental sustainability.\r\n\r\nPhase II Center research addresses questions that are important to reducing energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, increasing the sustainability of fossil fuel energy sources, and improving the technological efficiency of bioenergy and offshore wind energy. The bioenergy subproject concerns the production of bioenergy feedstock irrigated with treated produced water from fracking operations and generation of hydrocarbon fuels from that feedstock.  The Offshore Wind Energy subproject seeks improvement of the feasibility and reliability of massive offshore energy generation. The Environmental Sustainability subproject focus is on process engineering and stochastic methods to enhance the sustainability of fossil fuel energy sources, and life cycle assessment.\r\n\r\nPVAMU is a Historically Black University with an established record of preparing underrepresented minority students, particularly African Americans, for STEM careers, including advanced degrees  The Phase II CREST will strengthen that capability by: (1) positioning PVAMU's renewable energy program as a national resource addressing global energy issues related to renewable energy and sustainability; (2) Improving institutional infrastructure; professionally developing key personnel, and sustainability; (3) expanding collaborations with the energy industry; and (4) Enhancing the preparedness of students and building a diverse workforce. Curriculum and engagement components, including a new energy engineering curriculum at the undergraduate level and an energy concentration at the Master's level will impact hundreds of PVAMU students. The Center will provide energy-related research opportunities for 63 undergraduate and 20 graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
