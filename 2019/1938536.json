 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) supports conferences and workshops that seek to increase the research and education capacity of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students and faculty at HBCUs.  Morgan State University will organize a student symposium held in conjunction with the 91st National Technical Association (NTA) Annual Conference to be held on September 26-27, 2019 at Coppin State University. Undergraduate students from HBCUs will attend this two-day symposium to present their research and build a network of support by interacting with faculty and industry representatives.  \r\n\r\nThe NTA, established in 1926, promotes the involvement of undergraduate students in scientific and technical research activities. The symposium sessions will provide a culminating experience for students to disseminate research results to peers and professionals attending the NTA conference through oral and poster sessions.  Students will have the ability to attend some of the conference panels and presentations, the Career Awareness, Educational and Employment STEAM Opportunities Expo, and the awards presentation. A key objective is to provide undergraduate students the opportunity to network with scientists and engineers from academia, industry, government agencies, and the private sector.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
