This framework will permit security personnel to analyze a broad spectrum of information harvested from different sources. In addition, the research proposes an analytical approach to the study of network structure and the prediction of network behavior in the context of this framework. The ability to accurately model these characteristics provides a strong theoretical and practical basis for the Cyber Threat Intelligence framework.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Towards this the researchers use the Community Density Rank Algorithm (CDR) that applies a normalized Gaussian function to rank nodes by their impact within their neighborhood to detect communities. The algorithm identifies the density attractors and unique parent (leader) of each community using a hill-climbing procedure.  The CDR algorithm is found to outperform other state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.  However, while the CDR detects communities it does not inform the user as to how the information spreads in the network.  Using the insights from the CDR, the researchers developed a physics-inspired approach (Force model) for modeling the network at a microscopic level, .  In this model, the network nodes act as interacting particles that create potential at other nodes.  This leads to a potential gradient that indicates the natural direction of information diffusion through the network.  Influencers in the network are identified based on the value of their net potential.  In comparison to the  greedy algorithm proposed Kempe et al. it achieves comparative results without the prohibitive computational cost.  Using the Force model, we then studied the application of the results to a deep learning algorithm- the Heterogenous Graph Transformer where the force formulation is added as an attention mechanism within the heterogeneous nodes.  This is equivalent of a bias towards more higher potential nodes in the neighborhood.  The approach shows improved performance metrics in initial studies and is a valuable contribution since it can be applied on heterogenous real-world networks. This is a work in progress and requires further research as a basis for the integration of physical models into graph neural networks.\n\nIn summary, the research proposal explored a network-centric framework for cyber threat intelligence that leverages Network Science, data mining, and statistical mechanics.  Several new models that provide a better understanding of network dynamics and prediction enabling the identification of influencers and potential attackers were proposed as part of this framework and have shown good results. The framework is applicable as a practical tool for cyber threat intelligence and may be extended to social networks, transportation networks, and power grids to understand their behavior and identify vulnerabilities.  The results of this research were disseminated to the professional community through four (4) journal papers, three conference (3) papers, one (1) presentation, and one(1) report.\n\nThis research project has been successful in introducing CAU Computer Science students to Data Science and Machine Learning projects beyond the classroom.  Nineteen (19) undergraduate and seven (7) graduate students were exposed to Advanced Programming and Machine Learning techniques.  Their tasks including developing code, understanding research material, and performing other assigned tasks.  Three graduate students developed/presented papers in network analytics as part of this project.
