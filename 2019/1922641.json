 "awd_abstract_narration": "The STEM for All Collaboratory will advance educational research and development through the creation and facilitation of two related and interactive platforms: the STEM for All Video Showcase, and the STEM for All Multiplex. The Video Showcase provides an annual, online, week-long, interactive event where hundreds of educational researchers and developers create, share, and discuss 3-minute videos of their federally funded work to improve Science, Mathematics, Engineering, Technology and Computer Science education. Several years of successful Video Showcases have contributed to a rich database of videos showcasing innovative approaches to STEM education. To capitalize on the growing resource and extend its impact, this project will create a STEM for All Multiplex, a unique contribution to STEM education. The Multiplex will draw on past and future Video Showcase videos to create a multimedia environment for professional and public exchange, as well as to provide a way for anyone to search the growing database of videos, create thematic playlists, and re-use the content in new educational and research contexts. The Multiplex will host interactive, monthly, thematic online events related to emerging research and practices to improve STEM and Computer Science education in formal and informal environments. Each thematic event will include selected video presentations, expert panels, resources, interactive discussions and a synthesis of lessons learned. All events will be accessible and open to the public. The project will continue to host and facilitate the annual Video Showcase event which has attracted over 70,000 people from over 180 countries over the course of a year. This effort will be guided by a collaboration with NSF resource centers, learning networks, and STEM professional organizations, and will advance the STEM research and education missions of the 11 collaborating organizations. \r\n\r\nThe Video Showcase and the Multiplex will foster increased dissemination of federally funded work and will effectively share NSF's investments aimed at improving STEM education. It will enable presenters to learn with and from each other, offering and receiving feedback, critique, and queries that will improve work in progress and to facilitate new collaborations for educational research. It will connect researchers with practitioners, enabling both groups to benefit from each other's knowledge and perspective. Further, it will connect seasoned investigators with aspiring investigators from diverse backgrounds, including those from Minority Serving Institutions. It will thereby enable new researchers to broaden their knowledge of currently funded efforts while also providing them with the opportunity to discuss resources, methodology and impact measures with the investigators. Hence, the project has the potential to broaden the future pool of investigators in STEM educational research. This work will further contribute to the STEM education field through its research on the ways that this multimedia environment can improve currently funded projects, catalyze new efforts and collaborations, build the capacity of emerging diverse leadership, and connect research and practice.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project paired the power of video with rich and meaningful discourse. The enabling of research communities to build and share knowledge through video and discourse is an important innovation and enhancement to the educational and research infrastructure. The combination of video and discourse allowed for new collaborations to be formed, for multiple perspectives to be shared, for new ideas to proliferate, and for new visitors with an array of expertise to both gain exposure and to actively contribute to work in progress.</p>\n<p><em>The STEM for All Collaboratory</em> enhanced meaning-making through the creation and facilitation of two innovative, multimodal online environments, the STEM for All Video Showcase and the STEM for All Multiplex. Both platforms integrated video, discourse, links to resources and papers, facilitated discussions, and social media. The Video Showcase facilitated discourse across multiple communities of practice, and the Multiplex aggregated, analyzed, and synthesized content?thereby building a public network of STEM understanding.</p>\n<p>The<em> STEM for All Video Showcase </em>hosted annual 10-day interactive events in May of 2020, 2021 and 2022, during which presenters leading projects aimed at broadening participation and improving STEM and CS education, created and shared short video narratives of their project work and discussed them online with other researchers, educators, administrators, policy makers and the public at large. Discussion posts on the Video Showcase were robust, substantive, and reflective, with an average of 27 posts per presentation. The discussions offered a combination of ideas, resources, queries and constructive feedback.</p>\n<p>Presentations from each year?s Video Showcase were imported to the STEM for All Multiplex site (Multiplex.Videohall.com), which now houses 1,620 video presentations as well as transcripts of the rich online discussion that accompanied each presentation. Throughout the year, the Multiplex hosted interactive themed events, addressing emerging areas of interest to different subsets of the community. Each theme offered an introductory blog, related video presentations, an interactive webinar with a panel of experts, resources, an online discussion, and a synthesis brief which offered suggestions for researchers, educators, and policy makers to further advance the field.</p>\n<p>The Multiplex and the annual STEM for All Video Showcase events succeeded in broadly disseminating the work funded by NSF and other federal agencies nationally and internationally. These related platforms have had, in aggregate, over&nbsp;1,093,878 visits by 885,882 visitors from over 180 countries and territories. Individual presentations have had an average of 676 visits and 547 visitors. The 1,620 presentations were created by over 5,700 presenters and co-presenters from over 1200 institutions. Over the past three showcases (2020, 2021, 2022), over 25% of presentations were from a Minority Serving Institution (MSI) institution.</p>\n<p>Presenters and Co-Presenters reported that participating in the Video Showcase and Multiplex enabled them to broadly disseminate their project work, receive feedback that was helpful to their project moving forward, learn of related work in the field, reach new audiences interested in taking part in their project or utilizing their resources, and facilitated their making new contacts and collaborations for future grant proposals. They also noted that the project encouraged them to create a short video which was useful to their project and which they intended to reuse for conferences, recruitment, and outreach.</p>\n<p>The project sped up the cycle of research and innovation by providing the connective tissue between multiple communities of practice and various stakeholders interested in improving STEM and CS education. Through the sharing of project-created videos and facilitated discourse, it enabled related projects to learn with and from each other. It connected those working on similar topics and allowed them to exchange resources, strategies, and challenges. It connected seasoned investigators with leaders from diverse backgrounds at MSI institutions building the capacity of investigators, and potentially broadening the future pool of leaders in STEM educational research. Finally, it fostered knowledge sharing and facilitated implementation - feedback loops by connecting researchers with higher education faculty (who provide preservice and in-service), and K-12 practitioners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/10/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Joni&nbsp;Falk</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1922641/1922641_10625006_1696954369069_VideoSearch--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1922641/1922641_10625006_1696954369069_VideoSearch--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"STEM for All Multiplex Videos\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1922641/1922641_10625006_1696954369069_VideoSearch--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"STEM for All Multiplex Videos\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">STEM for All Multiplex Video Search Page.
