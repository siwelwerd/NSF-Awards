 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a pilot project to compare and test human visual inspection versus machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV) methods for identifying young star clusters (YSC) in high resolution images of galaxies.  It is the first step towards exploring and optimizing the ML methods so as to build a tool capable of automatic search, classification, and shape measurement of YSC.  This study will provide a launch-pad for the full project.  It seems likely that ML tools will be the only viable way to handle the vast 'Big Data' databases becoming common in astronomy.  An integrated educational component includes summer research for undergraduate students, including a valuable introduction to 'Big Data' issues.\r\n\r\nInitial tests will be performed on the two closest galaxies to our own Milky Way (M31 and M33), and then extended to M51 and NGC628, which are further away from us.  These are well-studied galaxies for which high-fidelity catalogs already exist, which are available for comparison and calibration.  The chosen test galaxies have very different cluster populations, and thus represent key testbeds to validate both the standard (human-based) approach and the future ML approach being developed.  ML/CV algorithms to be explored and tested on these images include very deep convolutional neural networks, which will be adapted to provide collective classifications of star clusters.  The human-based approach is currently the 'industry standard', and its validation will provide a more secure footing for future investigations of the physics of star formation in external galaxies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The standard process involves human classification of sources in multi-color high resolution images of galaxies, after an initial selection of the sources performed with automatic tools. These tools identify potential sources, but also include many contaminants (stars, background galaxies, image artifacts). The contaminants can represent between 50% and 70% of the total initial source catalogs, depending on the parameters used for the automatic selection. Hence, there is a need for visual inspection of the automatic catalogs, in order to separate bona-fide clusters from contaminants. This part of securing star cluster catalogs is time consuming, often requiring weeks to months to complete a galaxy, depending on the richness of its cluster population. In addition, different human classifiers can reach different conclusions on the nature of a source. This is because beyond a few Mpc, star clusters are no longer resolved into individual stars, and often appear barely more extended than a point source (e.g., a star). Detailed visualization of the candidate is thus required for obtaining a classification. Because of this problem, Citizen Science approaches have not been successful when applied to galaxies beyond our Local Group. <br /><br />Machine Learning provides an excellent approach to secure cluster populations while avoiding the bottleneck of human classification, or at least lightening the effort of the human classifiers. In addition to acceleratinng the pace of classifications, by reducing to several minutes to a few hours a task that normally takes weeks-to-months, Machine Learning offers the advantage of repeatability and homogeneity, once the algorithms are trained.
