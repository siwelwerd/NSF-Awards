 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is part of a larger initiative in the realm of 2 dimensional materials to envision and implement how data sciences can contribute to the development of this discipline to elucidate structure/processing/property correlations. At present, many materials problems of technological relevance suffer from lack of data frameworks. Indeed, lack of adequate frameworks to process, curate, and share complex raw data hinders progress in this field, ultimately not realizing the promise of 2 dimensional materials commercial technologies. In short, materials scientists are inundated with multi-dimensional data from many sources, both experimental and computational, and vast amounts of data are under-utilized, repeatedly acquired, or thrown out completely. purpose of this workshop is to provide students and postdocs with the adequate training to effectively build and use the needed framework towards sound data schemes and repositories in the realm of 2 dimensional materials. \r\n\r\nThis meeting is the first training event for students and postdocs of the recently constituted NSF-2D Data Framework (2DDF), which will be complemented by further training, as well as PI meetings that will result in a data platform, developed by PIs in a bottom up fashion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The advent of machine learning and \"AI\" techniques is poised to transform and accelerate progress in every scientific field, including materials science and materials discovery. In order to meet this promise, the materials research community must develop and disseminate the tools and techniques to enable data-driven discovery.\n\nThis project created the first data-centric workshop focused on the needs and interests of the 2D materials research community, specifically those within the DMR-2D research groups. The workshop was organized by the Platform for the Accelerated Realization, Analysis, and Discovery of Interface Materials (PARADIM), an NSF Materials Innovation Platform (MIP), in partnership with the NIST Office of Data and Informatics. The workshop was held from November 11-15, 2018 at the Mt. Washington Conference Center of Johns Hopkins University.\n\nIt brought together a diverse community that include graduate students, post-docs, faculty, and national laboratory scientist to learn/teach new concepts and skills for modern workforce development.  It also began the important process of community building required to develop a culture of data sharing and use.  Student feedback gathered through a survey at the end of the workshop shows significant gains in data-related thinking and highlighted four important findings that inform continued work to build materials data infrastructure that will help address the NSF Big Idea to Harness the Data Infrastructure. \n\nAll teaching materials are publicly available at https://github.com/paradimdata/nsf_2d_workshop_2018/ for anyone in the world to use, extend, and share.
