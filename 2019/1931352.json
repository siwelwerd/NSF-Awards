 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of what we know about the Earth's deep interior comes from the analysis of ground motion data recording seismic waves produced by large earthquakes from instruments around the entire planet.  Seismologists have developed a long list of methods to process modern seismic data to ?image? the Earth?s interior.  Much of our understanding of Earth's interior has been limited by the resolution of the tools available to construct these \"images\".  At present, the massive increase in data volume has pushed the data processing infrastructure of seismology to the breaking point.  The inability to handle data of this scale has imposed significant barrier to scientific discoveries, especially for the smaller research groups with limited resources.  Aiming to help improve this situation, this project introduces a new data management and processing system that is portable and scalable to run on any platforms from a personal computer to a large-scale supercomputer.  By leveraging and integrating sophisticated tools from cloud computing and high-performance computing (HPC) communities, the system can fill in the widening gap between the massive data made available by data centers and the inadequacy of data management and processing capability provided with current tools.  Seamless discovery, access, transfer, and processing of data and metadata outside of data centers will become possible for the community.  This project will also serve as the foundation to enable novel research utilizing massive data to change the way we study the structure, composition, and evolution of the Earth.\r\n \r\nThis project aims to develop a seismic data management and processing system that is composed of a scalable parallel processing framework based on dataflow computation model, a NoSQL database system centered on document store, and a container-based virtualization environment.  The scalable processing component will be based on the iterative map-reduce model using Apache Spark to handle scheduling and flow of data through systems of different scales.  The provenance-aware data management will be enabled by managing all data created during processing with MongoDB, including process generated metadata, processed waveform data, processing parameters, and the log outputs.  All these core components as well as a script to configure and deploy the framework on different systems will be containerized with Singularity to provide portability.  All these components serve the two primary goals of the project: produce a system that will allow common seismology algorithms to run effectively on modern HPC platforms; and provide the means for seismologists with average experience in programming to implement their own algorithms to extend the system.  The system will serve as the infrastructure to make data intensive research such as deep learning possible for smaller research groups that usually don't have the necessary manpower to manage and process massive data in a sustainable fashion.  By enabling the ability to process massive data collected by increasing number of instruments, it will facilitate the transition of the field into data-intensive paradigm of science discovery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
