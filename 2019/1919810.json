 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemical Instrumentation (CRIF) programs.  Professor Jeremy Feldblyum from SUNY at Albany and colleagues John Welch, Rabi Musah, Evgeny Dikarev and Marina Petrukhina have acquired a thermal gravimetric analysis system equipped with a mass spectrometer (TGA-MS).  This instrument measures the weight of a sample as it is heated.  As vapors evolve, the samples are analyzed by a mass spectrometer to determine the mass and chemical composition of the vapors emitted.  This data provides information on the identity of the sample itself and its composition (if a mixture).  The vapors may be decomposition products providing information on the thermal stability of the sample.   TGA-MS is a powerful tool in analyzing materials.  The research may impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry and polymer chemistry.  One example involves the synthesis of materials which can be used to separate high-value organic compounds in hydrocarbon fuels which are difficult to separate by distillation.  In another project, energy storage materials are being tested.  The thermal decomposition of novel polymers used in photolithography is also being investigated.  Instrumentation usage by local research institutions, including universities and colleges, commercial companies and government institutions (eg. the NY State Crime Laboratory) is encouraged. The instrument provides training opportunities for students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in research and laboratory instruction. \r\n\r\nThe acquisition of this thermogravimetric analyzer enhances the research and education of undergraduate and graduate students at SUNY at Albany and surrounding institutions. Heterometallic molecular precursors for the preparation of energy-related materials are under investigation.   Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are being tested for separating high-value organic compounds.  Storage materials such as for hydrogen capture are being synthesized and tested.  The decomposition mechanism of polymers useful in photolithography is followed in thermal heating studies.  Water desorption studies from RNA strands/fibers is assessed to understand thermal robustness and relative heats of adsorption.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
