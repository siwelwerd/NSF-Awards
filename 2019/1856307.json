IPCO presents the latest ground-breaking results aimed at the solution of difficult decision and optimization problems that have strong ramifications throughout engineering, logistics, mathematics and science. It is a competitive refereed conference.  This award supports student travel, attendance and participation, including by members of under-represented groups.  Supporting students in this fashion is vital for the long-term success of the combinatorial-optimization community. \r\n\r\nIPCO 2019 will be held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, May 22-24, 2019. The IPCO Summer School, aimed at graduate students, will be at the University of Michigan, May 20-21, 2019. The subject of the IPCO Summer School are: Discrepancy and Combinatorial Optimization, Semidefinite Programming for Combinatorial Optimization, and Sums of Squares in Polynomial Optimization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
