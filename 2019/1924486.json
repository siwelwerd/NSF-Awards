 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of SPANDAN project is to create a novel architecture-independent framework \r\nfor designing efficient, portable and scalable parallel algorithms for analyzing \r\nlarge-scale dynamic networks. SPANDAN will not only provide an intuitive methodology \r\nfor efficiently translating sequential algorithms into scalable parallel algorithms \r\nfor dynamic networks, but also provide mechanisms for their analytical evaluation and \r\nserve as a mediatory layer between applications and system level tuning. To evaluate \r\nthe effectiveness of SPANDAN framework in real-world applications, the PIs will \r\ncollaborate with social scientists and biologists. They will also integrate research \r\nfindings into various courses such as network analysis, parallel algorithms, and \r\nbioinformatics. They will further collaborate with high schools to develop summer courses \r\nwith the goal of encouraging women and minority students to pursue IT-related careers. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs the underlying methodology, the SPANDAN framework will exploit graph sparsification \r\ntechniques to divide the network into sparse subgraphs (certificates) that form the \r\nleaves of a sparsification tree. This innovative approach will lead to the design and \r\nanalysis of efficient parallel algorithms for updating dynamic networks, and reduction \r\nof memory latency associated with parallelizing unstructured data. Specifically parallel \r\nalgorithms will be designed for maintaining network topological characteristics, and \r\nupdating influential vertices and communities. To demonstrate portability and performance, \r\nthe developed algorithms will be implemented on the distributed memory clusters, shared \r\nmemory multicores, and massively multithreaded CRAY-XMT.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web site at:\r\n http://cs.mst.edu/labs/crewman/projects/SPANDAN/",
