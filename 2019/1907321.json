 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in cloud and autonomic computing spans a variety of areas, from distributed systems, computer architecture, middleware services, databases and data-stores, networks, machine learning, and control theory. The purpose of the Fifth International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) is to bring together researchers and practitioners across these disciplines to address the multiple facets of cloud and autonomic computing. ICAC is holding a doctoral symposium during the conference. The doctoral symposium is meant to engage students attending the symposium with interactions that provide them with research and career mentoring opportunities. The overall impact that such a meeting can have on Ph.D. students, both early and late in their studies, can be significant. The research presentations at the Doctoral Symposium will be made publicly. This project, thus, serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission: to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; or to secure the national defense.\r\n\r\nTo enable students to increase their interactions with other researchers, experts from both industry and academia will be invited to participate in the symposium program and/or deliver keynote talks at the ICAC doctoral symposium. The primary objectives of the doctoral symposium are to (1) provide a venue for graduate students to present their research and obtain feedback from experts in the area; (2) allow Ph.D. students to present their work at the main conference?s poster session; and (3) mentor the PhD students by providing career advice from representatives in industry as well as academia. Furthermore, the ICCAC doctoral symposium will have a special session devoted to career mentoring for Ph.D. students in attendance. The ICAC organization committee understands the diversity in the background of the Ph.D. students that attend the conference - while some will go into industry there will be those who go into academia. Therefore, the career mentoring session will allow students to listen and interact with experts in both areas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
