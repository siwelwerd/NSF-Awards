 "awd_abstract_narration": "Community college students are the most culturally and racially diverse population in higher education. However, limited attention is given to the impact these differences have on their college experience. This project is built upon the substantial body of research confirming that classroom and campus climate have a major influence on the recruitment and retention of underrepresented students in STEM. For example, women and other underrepresented groups are more likely to choose and be retained in a STEM major when there is a high degree of social capital, robust experiential learning, culturally-competent academic support, and the use of critical pedagogy that incorporates a multicultural approach to teaching. This project aims to develop a culturally-responsive Information Security associate degree program that is responsive to students' life experiences and the skills needed by industry.  This project can provide a foundation on which Northampton Community College and other community colleges can advance strategies that broaden participation in STEM careers, particularly in the skilled technical workforce. \r\n\r\nThe project includes a three-year comprehensive plan to achieve: 1) an enhanced Information Security associate degree program curriculum that is aligned with Center of Academic Excellence 2-Year designation requirements and regional workforce needs; 2) a recruitment plan that attracts underrepresented students into the cyber security field; 3) a retention plan that supports completion, transfer, career placement and/or advancement; and 4) a faculty/staff recruitment plan that meets future enrollment needs by incorporating strategies to develop qualified and culturally-competent computer science faculty. The project has the potential to illustrate the positive impacts of collaborations between STEM faculty and the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Specifically, the project may demonstrate that educating a globally competitive skilled technical workforce requires both an industry-driven curriculum and improvements to the educational outcomes of underrepresented students.  In addition, it has the potential to demonstrate that a culturally competent learning environment and student support system can improve student success in highly technical fields such as cyber security. Thus, project outcomes will provide information that can be used by educational institutions that are struggling to enroll, engage, retain, and graduate diverse student populations in STEM fields.  This project is funded by the NSF Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This is another major accomplishment, as NCC is one of only three community colleges in Pennsylvania to earn this designation.
