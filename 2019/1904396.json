 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines collective memory for a focal group of people in light of identity theory.  Identity theory states that individuals enact their identities in everyday interaction, based on feedback.  In this study, hypotheses will be tested concerning how collective memory of a high impact epidemic has affected the relationship between a group's behavior and identity, resulting in differences between cohorts.  Data will be collected through archival research and interviews. Findings will improve understanding of collective memory and generational differences, with broader relevance to health interventions and policies.\r\n\r\nMethods for this project consists of archival research and interviews.  The archival research will draw from collections of relevant documents from the 1970s to the present in order to identify which historical narratives persist over time and become collective memories.  Interviews with people from different generations will examine how themes emerging from the archival work appear in respondents' narratives regarding how they define their identity and experience their behavior. Results will identify potential strategies to manage the long-term social impact of traumatic events, particularly health-related events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
