 "awd_abstract_narration": "Missouri State University (MSU) will implement an ADVANCE Catalyst project to conduct an institutional self-assessment to understand the current status of women faculty in STEM disciplines on the main campus. This project will include a review of the current social and behavioral research on: gender equity, work-life balance, underrepresentation of certain groups in STEM, and organizational change. A central part of this project will be to undertake a comprehensive review of retention, promotion, and tenure (RPT) policies and related procedures and practices for each STEM department.  The project includes strategies to get direct input and advice from leaders of current and past ADVANCE institutions.\r\n\r\nThis two-year project will prepare the university for future data collection and data analyses of faculty equity which can be used by institutional leadership to inform decision-making.  The Catalyst work will also prepare the institution to implement evidence-based strategies to enhance the university climate for all faculty which will be outlined in a five-year faculty equity strategic plan that will be produced as part of this project.   \r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.  ADVANCE \"Catalyst\" awards provide support for institutional equity assessments and the development of five-year faculty equity strategic plans at an academic, non-profit institution of higher education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
