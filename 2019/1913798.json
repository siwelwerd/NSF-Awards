 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Observations of astrophysical gamma rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe and can be used to test fundamental physics.  This award supports scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles to carry out gamma-ray astrophysics research with two ground-based gamma-ray experiments, the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) and the newly commissioned prototype Schwarzschild Couder Telescope (pSCT), both located at the Fred Whipple Observatory in southern Arizona.  The group will participate in both technical aspects of operations and scientific investigations of Galactic and extragalactic astrophysical sources.  In addition, the award supports the leadership roles and activities of the group members in the development of a next-generation international gamma-ray observatory, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).  The group is deeply engaged in education and outreach efforts by involving high school students in astrophysics research and attracting the public, both in Arizona and in the Los Angeles area, to scientific exploration of the Universe.  \r\n\r\nThe University of California, Los Angeles group will contribute to the operations and maintenance of VERITAS and the pSCT and to the scientific analysis of the data.  With this award the group will focus on studies of Galactic and extragalactic sources with significant angular extension including the Cygnus region, the Galactic Center, galaxy clusters and active galactic nuclei, in which the signatures of primordial magnetic fields might be detectable in their gamma-ray emission. The development of novel data analysis techniques for sources with angular extension or poor localization capitalizes on the new capabilities offered by pSCT and the future CTA and is essential for the advancement of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger research as well as progress in time-domain astrophysics. The group is notably involved in CTA through the advancement of the pSCT technology for the observatory, through the development of its core science program, and through the top-level management provided to this worldwide project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It supported graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculties of the VHE astrophysics group, which made significant contributions to all aspects of VERITAS (<a href=\"https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/\">Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System</a>) ground-based gamma-ray observatory operation, including the upkeep of telescopes&rsquo; hardware, observing shifts, data quality monitoring, VERITAS data archiving, software and analysis development, and the production of scientific results. More than 20 publications were produced by VERITAS collaboration during the period of this award in which the members of the UCLA group were actively participating. The research led by the UCLA group included following activities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Coma Galaxy Cluster</em></strong>: Graduate student Brandon Stevenson completed the PhD research and defended thesis on &ldquo;<a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7wz4w5t7#main\">Probing for Extended Gamma-ray Emission Within and Beyond the Virial Radius from the Coma Galaxy Cluster</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp;In this work VERITAS observations were used to analyze a very large 6 x 8-degree field of the Coma galaxy cluster and evaluate the existence of possible extended gamma-ray emission. The analysis based on the maximum likelihood ratio revealed integral excess counts from the favored morphology of the shockwaves with a small significance of 2.7 sigma in the central 1.5-degree radius of the cluster. This observed central excess, while alone is not significant, has an angular extent in agreement with simulations and corresponds to a similar significance level seen by Fermi-LAT in the same region. The result of this work provides an integral constraint on CR content and magnetic fields in the Coma galaxy cluster and motivates further investigation by VERITAS and future observatories such as CTA (<a href=\"https://www.cta-observatory.org/\">Cherenkov Telescope Array</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Galactic Center region</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em>Graduate student Jamie Ryan of the UCLA group adopted and improved the VERITAS data analysis of the Galactic center (GC) region originally developed by the former UCLA graduate student Matt Buchovecky (Ph.D. 2019). Ryan completed a journal publication that covered more than 160 hours of VERITAS observations of the GC region and included the characterization (positions and spectra) of several detected VHE gamma-sources. Further, Ryan adapted a so-called template background method to estimate gamma-ray-like CR background in the GC region, which has angular size comparable to the field of view of VERITAS observatory. Using this background estimation technique, Ryan&nbsp;completed the PhD research and defended thesis on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/78d2f4gc\">&ldquo;Dark Matter Searches with Gamma Rays from the Galactic Center Halo and Cosmic-Ray Antimatter.&rdquo;</a>&nbsp; The limit on velocity-weighted cross section for WIMP dark matter self-annihilation obtained in this work is so far the best produced by VERITAS collaboration.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em><span>Extended gamma-ray emission and the morphology resolved spectroscopy of MGRO J1908+06. &nbsp;</span></em></strong>&nbsp;Postdoctoral researcher Ruo-Yu Shang led the development of a novel analysis method applicable to the sources of unknown morphology with the angular extent comparable or larger than the field of view of IACTs. This method utilizes the correlations of CR shower image parameters in gamma-ray-like and non-gamma-ray-like regions of the background distribution in two-dimensional parameter space. The method offers the reduction of the systematic error by roughly a factor of 3 as it derives the normalization of the gamma-ray-like background from the same data set and, hence, it enables the detection of weaker and largely extended gamma-ray sources. The MGRO J1908+06 exhibits complex energy-dependent morphology with large 1.5-degree&nbsp;angular extent and provides a valuable testing ground for understanding VHE astrophysics phenomena in the Universe. Major progress was made by the UCLA group in development of this method towards the publication of the VERITAS MGRO J1908+06 results, which demonstrates the continuity of the VERITAS spectrum of the source with the recently published LHAASO data. The draft of the multi-collaboration paper (VERITAS, Fermi-LAT, HAWC) on MGRO J1908+06, which utilizes this method and discusses the mechanisms behind the origins of TeV radiation based on detailed broadband modeling is undergoing internal review. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><br /></span></p>\n<p><strong><em>The Schwarzschild-Couder</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;Telescope technology verification and validation.</em></strong>&nbsp;This award allowed the UCLA group to provide chief contribution to the validation, verification, maintenance, and operation of the elaborated pSCT optical system (Picture 1) and the development of the optics alignment software.&nbsp;In June of 2022 the fully aligned pSCT demonstrated for the first time in the IACT technology the off-axis performance of the&nbsp;Schwarzschild-Couder&nbsp;optical system in which both the primary and the secondary mirrors are segmented.
