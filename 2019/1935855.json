The students will form teams that will participate in an international student challenge at ASPE. This funding will provide the students opportunities to exchange ideas with leading researchers and engineers from worldwide industrial and governmental facilities, as well as with students and faculty from both domestic and international schools. The students will also participate in expert tutorials.\r\n\r\nThis project will facilitate the formation of a cohort of students in the multidisciplinary field of precision engineering by their participation in an international student design competition and expert tutorials. Furthermore, this project will provide these students with the opportunity to learn the basic principles of precision engineering, how to prototype precision systems, and how to utilize enabling technologies like hardware programing and data acquisition and analysis. Participation in the 2019 ASPE Annual Meeting will give the students the opportunity to interact with leading experts from around the world, as well as with other students with similar interests.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Again, the award enables student teams to participate in an international student challenge and provides opportunities to exchange ideas with leading researchers and engineers from worldwide industrial and governmental facilities as well as with students and faculty from both domestic and international schools. The Annual Meeting of the American Society for Precision Engineering is considered a globally leading professional gathering in the precision engineering area; hence, the student participants learn the latest results and innovations in these fields.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The challenge requires students to design build, test, and characterize a process to perform a specified task using only components supplied by the committee. The challenge for 2019 asked the teams to create a measuring instrument to measure mass using the Watt-balance principle. This was supported by NIST who provided traceable masses to test the team solutions. For the 2020 challenge student teams were required to make a machine for scribing optical diffraction grating rulings on a flat copper surface. Due to challenges presented by the pandemic, the conference became virtual and the challenge was changed to require teams to produce a scribe tool controller. Using the tool to make diffraction gratings is now the topic for the 2021 challenge.</p>\n<p>Budget for this proposal was used to cover registration and tutorial expenses for student participants.
