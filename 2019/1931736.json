 "awd_abstract_narration": "Observations of planets around other stars will be one of the main targets of the future James Webb Space Telescope and the 30-meter diameter telescopes under construction here on the Earth. The investigator will create computer programs to model the observations of the atmospheric structure and composition of those planets near to Earth in size, or super-Earths. These programs will be used to study the characteristics of atmospheres, focusing on their temperatures and pressures, of many different types of super-Earths. The investigator will make these programs broadly available to other scientists to use for their research. This project serves the national interest as it helps our scientific understanding of the properties of planets around other stars that are similar to the Earth, and which could harbor life. The investigator will also teach special courses for students with a low level of STEM preparation, and create a peer mentoring program for STEM students coming from backgrounds that traditionally are not represented in these fields, to fight lower success rates in STEM classes at her home institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe investigator will build a set of computational tools that will be broadly applicable to modeling the radiative transfer and atmospheric chemistry for low-mass exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. The research will first complete the development of Exo-RT, a robust radiative transfer (RT) suite of codes that will calculate atmospheric structure (temperature-pressure profiles), emission spectra, and transmission spectra for transiting exoplanets. The key improvement of this RT suite over existing codes is its inherent ability to model atmospheres of arbitrary atmospheric composition, making it ideally suited toward modeling a diverse set of super-Earths. The fully developed code will then be applied to a number of studies of super-Earth atmospheres, determining the extent to which the attributes of a super-Earth can be inferred from observations of its atmosphere and measurements of its bulk density. Atmospheric studies of super Earths are a key science motivation for future exoplanet investigations with the James Webb Space Telescope and ground-based 30-meter class telescopes. At her home institution, Grinnell College, the investigator will also implement a spatial reasoning course for students with a low level of STEM preparation, and a peer mentoring program for STEM students from traditionally underrepresented groups, to combat lower success rates in STEM classes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis CAREER grant supported the work of Dr. Eliza Kempton and her research group to model the diverse atmospheres of low-mass exoplanets in order to prepare for and interpret data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). At the start of the funding period in 2017, very little was yet known about exoplanets smaller than Neptune and what the properties of their atmospheres were. By the end of the funding period, JWST had launched and was obtaining atmospheric data for a wealth of such planets. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe early phases of the grant were used to complete the development of flexible radiative transfer models that could be applied to low-mass exoplanets of diverse composition in order to predict the 1-D temperature structure and spectra (both transmission and emission) of such objects. The transmission spectrum code is published as Exo-Transmit, with an offshoot python-based retrieval code called PLATON. The thermal structure and emission spectrum code is published as HELIOS. The latter was a pre-existing code that received an overhaul as part of this grant to generate emission spectra for rocky planets with arbitrary surface composition, atmospheric composition, and atmospheric thickness. All of these codes have been made publicly available on Github. Once the models were fully developed, they were applied to predict and ultimately interpret spectroscopic observations of super-Earth and sub-Neptune atmospheres obtained with the Hubble (HST), Spitzer, and James Webb (JWST) Space Telescopes. \n\n\n\n\n\nKey theoretical advances to result from this grant include the ability to self-consistently model rocky exoplanet atmospheres in radiative-convective equilibrium for arbitrary surface and atmosphere properties, and the development of models that more accurately account for non-hydrogen background gas (e.g., water-rich or CO2-dominated atmospheres). In particular, our models of rocky planet thermal emission were critical in developing a new technique of eclipse photometry for establishing whether terrestrial exoplanets host atmospheres or not. This technique has been demonstrated successfully with JWST and it currently underpins a 500-hour directors discretionary time program to determine the occurrence rate of rocky planet atmospheres.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther major observational results associated with this grant include the interpretation of the first rocky planet eclipse measurements with Spitzer and JWST. Our models provide strong constraints on atmospheric thickness, revealing that certain terrestrial exoplanets likely do not host atmospheres at all. Our models additionally motivated the first phase curve observations of a sub-Neptune (GJ 1214b), resulting in the discovery that the planet hosts a hydrogen-poor atmosphere with highly reflective hazes; as well as various other JWST studies of super-Earths, sub-Neptunes, and potential water world candidates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis grant additionally supported a peer mentoring program for astronomy majors from underrepresented groups at the University of Maryland. Incoming first-year students were paired with junior/senior-level astronomy majors for weekly peer mentoring meetings. This program was developed to establish peer groups, a sense of belonging, and an understanding of academic norms among students who are typically considered at risk for underperforming and/or dropping out from STEM majors. The Astronomy Peer Mentors (APM) program is now in its 7th year at UMD, and it typically enrolls ~10-20 mentees from the first-year class of astronomy majors. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/16/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ElizaKempton\n"
