 "awd_abstract_narration": "To better understand how earth?s ecosystems such as oceans, lakes, forests and farms sustain the needs of species, including humans, the science of ecology needs to increase its rigor, precision, and predictive power. Such advances will enable a better understanding of human interactions with nature and improve our ability to forecast how environmental change will affect services provided by natural and agricultural ecosystems in the future. To reach these goals, this project will synthesize three decades of the principle investigator's and his close colleagues' research into a predictive theory of the way ecosystems with many species are organized and how they change over time. The core of this theory is based on organisms' abilities to consume resources, grow, and be consumed by other organisms as well as the network architecture of these consumer-resource interactions among tens, hundreds and thousands of species. Elements of this general theory have been published in over one hundred papers, most of which are sole or co-authored by this project's principle investigator. How the ideas in all these papers fit together, including the theory, its foundations, and future directions have yet to be adequately synthesized and articulated. This project will describe that synthetic framework in the form of a book, a review article, visualizations and video animations that define the concepts, equations and computer simulations underlying the theory. This research will also increase the accessibility of ecological network theory to broader audiences, and advance the careers of researchers who are members of groups underrepresented in the sciences.\r\n\r\nThis project will synthesize theory focused on the structure, dynamics, and evolution of food webs and their bipartite subsets including mutualistic and host-parasite/pathogen networks based on integrating consumer-resource theory with network theory and the metabolic theory of ecology. This involves describing the conceptual and computational theory of allometric trophic networks and its application to ecological, evolutionary and sustainability sciences including predictions of the quantitative consequences of species loss, fishing, and climate change. Further development aims to advance a systems biology of ecology that synthesizes ecology by integrating its subdisciplines, especially organismal, population, community and ecosystem ecology, as well as the interface between ecology and evolutionary, social, sustainability, and network sciences. Benefits to society include increasing our understanding of ecosystem management and eco-evolutionary and coupled natural-human dynamics. Two years of research and writing will be conducted involving collaborative visits to international and domestic centers of network and ecological network research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

(Kayla Hale U. of AZ) and another Ph.D (Nick Kappler, U. of AZ), over a dozen presentations including an plenary talk at the 2019 Conference on Complex Systems in Singapore and an organized oral session at the 2019 Ecological Society of America Conference in New Orleans. The project also supported additional research and writing for the proposed book.\n\n\nOne of the publications, Mutualism increases diversity, stability, and function of multiplex networks that integrate pollinators into food webs, published in Nature Communications describes methods and results for models that integrate two fundamentally different mechanisms responsible for the behavior of communities and ecosystems but have previously been studied largely alone. One mechanism is the more traditional and well-studied process of feeding involving trophic relationships among coexisting organisms including herbivory, predation, food chains and food webs etc. The other mechanism is the more recently studied reproductive servicing involved in processes such as pollination and seed dispersal. Such services are critical to sustaining the vegetation that comprises most of the biomass on Earth and the vast amount of heterotrophic biodiversity that depends on that vegetation for the energy needed to power its existence, growth and evolution. By integrating these two largely separate fields of study, we were able to better understand how ecosystems and communities function and challenge long embraced theories with new theories more consistent with available data. More specifically, instead of the instabilities thought to result from mutualistic interactions that benefit both participants, mutualisms were found to increase the diversity, stability, and function of complex ecosystems. A key contribution of this work was to replace the more phenomenological consideration of interactions between organisms as being assumed to have either positive or negative effects on the participants with more mechanistic consumer-resource representations where net effects dynamically emerged from feeding and reproductive services. Based on that research, Kayla Hale, first author and my Ph.D. student at the time, won the 2018 Volterra Award for the best student presentation in theoretical ecology from the Ecological Society of America.\n\n\nAnother publication reviewed these and other advances led by the PIs lab of what has become known as Allometric Trophic Network (ATN) theory that has integrated many areas of ecology largely considered separately. As explained in the reviews abstract: ATN theory does this 'by integrating across scales, taxa, habitats and organizational levels from physiology to ecosystems based on consumer-resource interactions among co-existing organisms Beyond ecology, ATN theory also synthesizes eco-evolutionary and socio-ecological research still largely based on consumer-resource mechanisms but respectively integrated with different processes including natural selection and market mechanisms.'

This challenge is inspired and empowered by the related and spectacularly productive challenge to predict the structure and function of organisms (phenotype) from its DNA (genotype).\n\n\nOverall, the project supported the synthesis of various subdisciplines of ecology and other fields of study in order to provide a more general and powerfully predictive understanding of natural systems including humans and the ecosystems that sustain us.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/11/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: NeoDMartinez\n"
