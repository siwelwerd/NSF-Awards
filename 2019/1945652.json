 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerical algorithms are pervasive in our lives today.\u00a0 These algorithms are used, for example, to send data to mobile devices and to simulate fire and water in movies.\u00a0 Many of the most classical algorithms, and particularly those with applications in linear algebra, have been extremely useful for decades, if not centuries.\u00a0 Yet, some of these algorithms are poorly understood -- they can fail catastrophically, but rarely do.\u00a0 In other words, the worst-case behavior is poor, but the average-case behavior is good.\u00a0 This research will advance the understanding of this phenomenon by employing techniques from the ever-expanding field of random matrix theory (RMT).\u00a0 In turn, this research gives rise to new questions within RMT. A substantial feature of this project is the extensive educational component that integrates research and education. This integration is achieved via a three-pronged approach including a summer workshop on random matrices, high school engagement, and undergraduate/graduate student mentoring.\r\n\r\nTwo natural ways to employ RMT within numerical linear algebra also coincide with the two most common themes in numerical linear algebra: Algorithm analysis and algorithm development. For example, remarkably detailed estimates from RMT such as rigidity and edge universality have found concrete applications within numerical linear algebra giving average-case performance for the classical power method. Randomized algorithms have found great utility in the big-data age.\u00a0 This research will employ both of these themes with applications to data science, psychology and beyond.\u00a0 The synergy of the fields of RMT and numerical linear algebra provides a unique educational opportunity for graduate, undergraduate and high school students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nRandom matrix theory and numerical linear algebra have been tied since essentially the inception of the digital computer.  This 5 year CAREER award has aided in the further exploration of connections between these two areas and the development of applications based on their synergy.\nThe research during the grant period culminated in the development of a new theory that gives a significant step forward in the understanding of widely-used numerical algorithms when applied in a randomized setting.\nThis understanding was the result of a number of technical advances:\n\n\nThe demonstration of a concentration of measure phenomenon in the conjugate gradient algorithm, which shows that deterministic behavior is possible in random contexts.\n\n\nThe development of a theory of universality which expands the scope and the applicability of the first observation.\n\n\nThe application of the theory to the famed spiked covariance matrix model from statistics.\n\n\nThe novel use of the so-called Fokas-Its-Kitaev Riemann-Hilbert problem to perform a perturbation analysis.\n\n\nIt is expected that the theory developed here will result in new, efficient, theory-based statistical tools.\nSelect additional outcomes are as follows:\n\n\nIn 1995, Parker showed that by randomizing a matrix with butterfly matrices, one can avoid the need for pivoting in Gaussian elimination and not affect the leading-order complexity of the algorithm.  Pivoting is a necessary tool to solve general systems of linear equations, but can be expensive in the age of parallel computations.  An analysis of the so-called growth factor associated with these matrices was performed by the PI and collaborator to help understand the stability of this algorithm and the propagation of rounding errors within it.\n\n\nWith collaborators, the PI presented a new unified analysis and understanding of stochastic Lanczos quadrature, unifying it with the so-called kernel polynomial method.  This randomized algorithm allows one to access information within a matrix when that matrix is too large to store in the memory of a computer.  The analysis gives a streamlined framework to use both algorithms simultaneously.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/22/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas D Trogdon"
