 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study distant galaxies in the midst of shutting down their last burst of star formation and metamorphosing from spiral galaxies - like the Milky Way - into round and dead elliptical galaxies. Although this process is common, as most large galaxies are ellipticals while young galaxies are spirals, it is poorly understood. This project will use the detailed properties of newly transformed galaxies in stars and gas to test formation models. The broader impacts will support underrepresented minority students transition to graduate school through bridge programs at Princeton University and the University of Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nThis work assesses possible quenching mechanisms using a unique sample of intermediate-redshift massive post-starburst galaxies. These galaxies have recently quenched their major star-forming episode - yet they are sufficiently nearby that multi-wavelength observations can illuminate their detailed, spatially resolved stellar properties and molecular gas reservoirs. By combining the resolved kinematics, distribution of stellar ages, remaining gas content, and visual morphologies of this statistical sample of recently quenched massive galaxies and comparing with the timescales and stochasticity of quenching within the SIMBA cosmological simulations, this project will determine the dominant quenching mechanism(s) driving the transformation of blue star forming, rotating, disk galaxies into red-and-dead, kinematically hot, spheroids. In addition, the team will extend a proven program to broaden and strengthen support of post-baccalaureate students at Princeton and the University of Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
