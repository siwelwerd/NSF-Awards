 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal provides funding for the fourth GREPSEC: Underrepresented Groups in Security Research workshop, which will held in May 2019, in San Francisco, CA. This day-and-a-half-long workshop intended for women and underrepresented minorities in computer security and privacy, will be co-located with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Computer Society's Security and Privacy Symposium, the premier conference in security. \r\n\r\nThe broad goal of the workshop is to increase the number of women and underrepresented minorities in computer security research. Security is a wide field, encompassing network security, operating system security, language-based security, forensics, privacy, as well as legal and policy issues. The goal of the organizers is to encourage graduate and highly motivated undergraduate students who are female and from underrepresented groups to choose security as their field of specialization. Their approach is to show the wide range of problems within the field and how women and underrepresented groups are working towards solving those problems with talks and interactive participatory sessions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The workshops were held proximate to, the leading cybersecurity research conferences, the IEEE Security and Privacy Conference, the USENIX Security Conference, and an event at the Crypto Conference.  The project introduced targeted students to current topics in research and provided them with the opportunity to meet leading researchers and network with each other.  \n\nThe GREPSEC Series of workshops began in 2013 and workshops were held in alternating years in 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019. In 2021 a fully virtual workshop was held.  The workshops were funded through a series of grants from NSF. This Outcomes report is for the 4th GREPSEC Grant ? GREPSEC IV which supported workshops in 2019, 2021 and a special event GREPSEC at Crypto in 2022. \n\nThis grant supported two GREPSEC Workshops. GREPSEC IV, held in San Francisco, CA May 18-19, 2019, and a virtual workshop August 5-6, 2021 in conjunction with the USENIX Security Conference.  GREPSEC IV had 35 students and 11 speakers. The Virtual GREPSEC V Workshop had 44 students, 9 speakers, and 8 mentors.  In 2022 we organized a panel and reception for GREPSEC at Crypto on August 16, 2022.  That event had 40 people participating, about half of whom were students. \n\nThe programs and other information about the workshops can be found at:\nhttp://www.ieee-security.org/grepsec/\nand \nhttps://grepsec.github.io/program.html\n\nThe GREPSEC workshops have exposed approximately 240 women and minority students to the researchers and topics that are most exciting in the field.  Most of the students also attend the conferences - Security and Privacy Symposium (S&amp;P), USENIX Security and Crypto that immediately followed the workshops.  They formed groups during breaks, they felt empowered to ask questions, and got to know other students and researchers.\n\n\nNumerically, it is still difficult to measure the impact of GREPSEC on the careers of the student attendees.  In 2018 we counted the publications by attendees in the years following their attendance, and we found that there had been 33 papers published.  Two former students were on the program committees of major security conferences.   One of our previous speakers is a co-program chair of S&amp;P for 2020, which at least shows that our workshop counts as a positive factor in the career development of junior faculty.\n\nWhen we ran the numbers in June 2019, we found that GREPSEC attendees had published a total of 400 papers since the first workshop in 2013.   This included 23 papers in 2019.  The publication venues were largely those concerned with aspects of computer security and privacy (e.g., NDSS, ACM CCS, IEEE Security and Privacy, ASIACCS, etc.).  This demonstrates that GREPSEC students are often quite successful in continuing their research in security and privacy.  We cannot prove that this is the direct result of GREPSEC, but it is strong circumstantial evidence that the meeting is having an impact.\n\nThe most recent GREPSEC event was held in conjunction with the Crypto Conference. We organized a panel discussion and reception. During the reception, the women were encouraged to suggest things that could help them to navigate graduate programs and their early career paths, both in industry and academia.  All suggestions were recorded along with the number of ?up votes? for each one.  The results were posted to a Slack channel created after the conference ended.\n\nSubsequently, the conference organizer, a woman who is a leader in applied cryptography, was elected to the IACR board of directors.  Her support of the women?s reception had been an important factor in getting it to happen.\nIn preparing for the event, we noted that several senior women in the field mentioned that they felt they were hard-pressed to support more women?s initiatives.  There are few senior women to draw on for this kind of leadership, and they fervently hope that more women will be drawn into the field and will be able to share advocacy and mentoring roles.\n\nThe IACR board president spent a few minutes at the reception and indicated that he supports the women?s efforts.  He and a few other men who expressed willingness to be supportive were also notably reluctant to intrude on a women?s event.  Their reticence was a real-life illustration of the need for more inclusiveness so that all participants feel welcome at the cryptography conferences (which are heavily skewed towards male participants).\n\nAlthough we have no measurable results available currently, we do know that this is the first time that the IACR has taken formal note of the affinity groups that attend the conferences.  We hope it is the beginning of a larger conversation and set of actions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/15/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Terry V Benzel"
