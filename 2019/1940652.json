 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the organization of the annual Principal Investigators (PI) meeting for the National Robotics Initiative (NRI), which was launched in 2011. The PI meeting will bring together the community of active NRI participants to provide cross-project coordination of intellectual challenges and best practices in education, technology transfer and general outreach. This activity will also establish a repository illustrating the research ideas explored and milestones achieved by the NRI projects.  The meeting is planned for two days in February of 2020 in the vicinity of Washington DC. The format will include presentations by the attending PIs of projects in their final year, a poster session with all other projects, keynote speeches, and panel discussions.\r\n\r\nThis award is to organize the next NRI PI meeting.  The meeting promotes dissemination and serendipitous collaboration amongst NRI researchers.  The organization includes participation and BPC recruitment activities for graduate students as well as PIs.  This award is for the meeting organization only.  Meeting logistics and facility rental is handled by a separate award.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA University of Michigan Robotics Institute team organized the National Robotics Initiative (NRI) Principal Investigators' (PI) Meeting and Technical Conference held February 27-28, 2020 at the Renaissance Hotel in Crystal City, Virginia.  A logics team from Vanderbilt University handled reservations, catering, virtual organization website submissions, program production support, and related communications.   NSF program managers kicked off the event with a presentation of existing and upcoming NSF programs relevant to NRI researchers.  Two keynote speakers described their groups' long-term research efforts and practical experiences in robotic mobility and manipulation for deep-sea and space exploration.  NRI PIs presented their research accomplishments as a combination of long talks, lightning talks, and poster presentations.  Breakout sessions in Ethics for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Agricultural Robotics, Urban Air Mobility (UAM), and Smart Materials for Robotics were held.  Panelists discussed \"Collegiality and Diversity in Robotics Research\" and \"Robotics and Learning at Scale\".  NSF provided travel scholarships to students from universities underrepresented at NRI meetings to enable them to attend and interact with participants and government representatives.  The 2020 event had the largest NRI PI meeting attendance to-date with over 240 attendees representing over 150 NRI projects.  Positive feedback was received during and after the event.  We were fortunate to hold this event just prior to COVID-19 related travel restrictions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ella M Atkins"
