 "awd_abstract_narration": "The DNA of multicellular organisms is packaged into linear chromosomes. The goal of this project is to understand how cells deal with DNA breaks, specifically how breaks near the ends of linear chromosomes are treated differently from breaks in other locations. The outcomes will help clarify why breaks near the ends of chromosomes do not trigger a DNA damage response while those at other locations do, and how this differential treatment maintains genome integrity. The project will offer research training and career development opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, and a post-doctoral scientist, particularly aimed at increasing diversity in the STEM workforce. Results from the project will also be integrated into coursework in order to teach students current concepts of genomic stability.\r\n\r\nA fundamental question in the field of chromosome biology is why telomeres, the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes, are stable while internal double-strand breaks are not. DNA double-strand breaks promote genomic instability by DNA recombination and cause growth arrest by activating cell cycle checkpoints, but telomeres are stable and allow continuous cell growth. Telomeres are composed of DNA repeat tracts bound by specific proteins that \"cap\" the chromosome end to prevent its degradation and block checkpoint activation. This project will investigate how telomeres accomplish these functions by using an inducible telomere formation system that leverages powerful molecular genetics tools in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe model system. The specific hypothesis to be tested is whether S. pombe telomeres recruit effectors that post-translationally modify checkpoint proteins to block DNA damage signaling. Known candidate proteins will be tested and new candidate proteins will be sought by proteomic approaches in a comprehensive approach to identify the effectors of DNA damage checkpoint suppression at telomeres. The project will offer research training for graduate and undergraduate students, and a post-doctoral scientist, and project outcomes will be integrated into coursework.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are sensed by a checkpoint machinery that halts cell growth, so cells have a chance to repair this damage. DSBs thus cause growth arrest, and also promote genomic instability by DNA recombination. In contrast, telomeres have functions that allow continuous cell growth and complete replication of the chromosome end. Telomeres are composed of DNA repeat tracts bound by specific proteins that cap the chromosome end to prevent its degradation and allow its complete replication by standard DNA synthesis and telomerase. Damaged telomeres that lack some telomere proteins do not activate the checkpoint that senses DNA damage, indicating that a subset of telomere proteins play a role in checkpoint suppression. Our lab made the first inducible telomere formation system in S. pombe, where an induced DSB exposes telomere repeats to form a telomere. While the side of the induced DSB with no telomere sequences is degraded just like an internal DSB, an internal DSB activates the DNA damage checkpoint to cause the cell cycle to pause while the forming telomere does not. Therefore, telomeres show an anti-checkpoint activity that can span the DSB to prevent the cell cycle pause.
