 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global environmental change can cause large-scale disruptions to ecosystems by gradually shifting both the presence and abundance of different plant species. Many ecosytems are characterized by a few dominant plants, but it is unclear if these species will remain dominants as environmental conditions change. The loss of dominant species may have a large impact, creating a potential cascade of effects on the overall structure and function of the ecosystem. Ongoing work at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico indicates that a common desert grass is gradually replacing a widespread Great Plains grass. To understand how changes in rainfall amount, timing and variability affect the rate, amount and direction of reordering among the dominant grass species, this project will link the effects of species reordering to carbon cycling and net primary production. Experiments will alter water, temperature and nitrogen availability to test how grasslands respond to these environmental changes. Dryland ecosystems, which cover ~45% of global continental land area, have measurable impacts on the global carbon budget. Drylands are changing rapidly in response to droughts, air pollution, and increased rainfall variability. Community reordering may be key to advancing the understanding of different global change factors affecting dryland ecosystems in the southwestern United States and elsewhere.\r\n \r\n\r\nGrasslands cover >240 million ha (33% of land area) in the continental US, providing valuable resources for  livestock, wildlife habitat, water resources, recreation, and carbon storage.  Three experiments will test how environmental change alters the presence, success and contiuity of 2 important grasslands, one dominated by the Chihuahuan Desert grass, black grama, and the other by Great Plains grass, blue grama. Both are important forage grasses that respond differently to global change. One experiment will alter the severity of drought and seasonality of rainfall, while a second experiment manipulates warming, nitrogen fertilization and winter (El Nino) rainfall on plots located in the ecotone where blue and black grama co-occur. The third experiment alters the size and frequency of summer rain events in black grama grassland, which is most likely to experience future invasion by native shrubs (another kind of reordering among species). To improve understanding of the causes and consequences of community reordering among these species, measurements of important carbon processes (root production and soil respiration) along with additions of seeds and biological soil crusts will directly test for interactive effects of plant and microbe community reordering on ecosystem function.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
