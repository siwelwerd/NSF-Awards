 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atoms frozen in solid hydrogen exhibit promising quantum mechanical properties. For example, recent work has shown that rubidium atoms in solid hydrogen have properties that make them extremely sensitive magnetic field sensors. The first goal of this project is to measure a single atom inside solid hydrogen for use as a magnetic field sensor. If successful, this single-atom \"quantum sensor\" could be used to measure the structure of complex biomolecules, which would be of great utility for biochemistry and medicine. The second goal of this project is to measure the quantum mechanical properties of molecules inside solid hydrogen. If certain molecules exhibit favorable properties, these molecules could then be used for precision measurements leading to an improved understanding of fundamental physics and the Standard Model. In pursuing these goals, the project will make measurements that will help better understand the physics of atoms and molecules inside the \"quantum solid\" of solid hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThis experimental physics research program will measure atoms and molecules in solid parahydrogen, with two main goals. First, the project will investigate the fluorescence properties of alkali-metal atoms in solid parahydrogen and develop techniques to optically address single atoms. Alkali-metal atom ensembles in parahydrogen have previously demonstrated long transverse relaxation times, so the ability to optically address single atoms will enable their use as quantum sensors for magnetic fields, with possible applications in nano-MRI experiments. The second experimental goal is to measure the transverse relaxation time of the nuclear spin of ensembles of polar molecules in solid parahydrogen. This will shed light on the motion of molecules in this quantum solid. Moreover, if the nuclear spin dephasing time is as favorable as expected, it has the potential to lead to improvements in fundamental physics measurements (such as the search for an electric dipole moment and related time-violating physics) with heavy polar molecules.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
