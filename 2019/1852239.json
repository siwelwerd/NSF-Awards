 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Michigan Physics REU program provides a transformative summer research experience for undergraduate students from around the country who otherwise may not have access to a major research program. The first goal of the program is to prepare the students for a career in the physical sciences. The second goal is for the students to perform cutting edge research in modern physics laboratories with active research groups and dedicated faculty. The research areas include astrophysics and cosmology, atomic, molecular and optical physics, condensed matter physics, high energy physics, nonlinear dynamics, complex systems and nuclear physics. \r\n\r\nThe REU students work closely with a faculty mentor on a carefully crafted ten-week research project. The selected students are interviewed to determine their interest and are then matched to faculty who are active in research in that area. The project is defined based on the interest of the student and the research needs of the faculty. In addition to the research project the students are exposed to a variety of research topics and methodologies through a series of faculty research seminars. Professional development is a critical part of the REU program and students participate in tutorials on ethics, applying to graduate school, applying for grants, scientific writing and giving scientific presentations. Students engage in additional educational and social activities, including safety training, machine shop and electronic shop classes, lab tours and a variety of lunches with other students and faculty. These activities allow students to put their research experience in a wider perspective, to build a network of professional contacts, and to develop professional skills in a scientific environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over the three-year period covered by this award, the Department hosted a total of 28 REU students from a variety of institutions, including 11 from primarily undergraduate institutions.\n\nIn addition to a strong focus on meaningful research under the supervision of a world-class faculty mentor, the REU Site organized a wide variety of professional and enrichment activities.

While the summer 2019 program was held in-residence as usual, the summer 2020 program transitioned to completely virtual, despite having been planned to be in-residence.  Both students and their REU faculty mentors proved to be flexible in making this transition, and in the end the virtual program was successful, based on student feedback.  The summer 2021 program was held in residence with Covid-19 restrictions in place.\n\nMany program activities, including the REU Symposium held at the end of the summer, included students from the Biophysics and other REU programs as well as internal students at the University of Michigan.  This provided numerous opportunities for the students to interact and begin to build up a professional network and to frame their projects in the context of the overall environment at a major research university.\n\nBased on student surveys, this REU Site has been successful in having students gain confidence in performing research and in functioning independently in a laboratory setting.
