 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project concerns algebraic geometry, the study of systems of polynomial equations in many variables.  The project focuses on equations formulated in characteristic p for some prime number p.  The \"characteristic p world\" is one where, every time you take p steps forward, you wind up back where you start.  Far from being esoteric, such mathematical systems describe the procession of the days of the week (p = 7), the fundamentals of computer architecture (p = 2), and also the setting for important cryptosystems.  Algebraic geometry in characteristic p is the study of geometric objects (\"varieties\") given by solutions to polynomial equations in this setting.  This project investigates the relationship between varieties in characteristic p and in characteristic zero (\"standard\" algebraic geometry), with the goal of shedding light on both worlds.  Graduate students will take a major part in the research project.  The research will be complemented by educational activities involving the undergraduate math club.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this research project is devoted to understanding when branched Galois covers of curves lift from characteristic p to characteristic zero, and to obtaining information about the geometry and arithmetic of the lifts.  In particular, the project aims to obtain a classification of the so-called \"local Oort groups\" and \"weak local Oort groups\".  The second part of the project involves analyzing integral models of Galois covers of curves over p-adic fields.  New tools involving deformation data shed light on stable models of Galois covers of curves with complicated Galois groups.  These tools will be exploited further in order to understand stable models of Galois covers as explicitly as possible.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe PI's project concerned curves cut out by polynomial equations with coefficients in characteristic p and characteristic zero, where the characteristic p world is as described in the project abstract and the characteristic zero world is the more \"standard\" world in which rational numbers live.\n\nThere is a long-studied \"lifting problem\", which asks whether characteristic p curves equipped with certain groups of symmetries always have analogs in characteristic zero.  There is only a small list of symmetry groups for which this is expected to be true, and the PI and his graduate students showed during the course of the project that the lifting problem has a positive answer for three of these groups (the symmetries of a square, a 25-gon, and a 27-gon in space).  The PI also wrote the state-of-the-art exposition on this problem, which appeared in a book on open questions in algebraic geometry.\n\nThe PI also studied how curves in characteristic zero reduce to characteristic p, which is a process by which a smooth curve can acquire singularities (such as corners or crossings).  The PI applied this during the project period to the study of dynamical systems in a paper that linked reduction of curves, number theory, and the Mandelbrot set in complex dynamics.  He also showed in a special case how these singularities can be \"resolved\" (i.e., made as smooth as possible), and applied this to prove a fundamental relationship between two numerical invariants of curves given by equations of the form y^2 = f(x).\n\nThe PI gave over 30 conference, colloquium, and seminar lectures on his work during the course of the award.  Additionally, he mentored six PhD students, four of whom have completed their degree working on projects related to the award, and the other two of who are expected to graduate by 2023.  All papers produced as a result of this award have been made publicly on arxiv.org as well as the PI's website.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/18/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew S Obus"
