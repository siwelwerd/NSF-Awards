 "awd_abstract_narration": "Raman spectroscopy enables researchers to identify the composition and characterization of nanomaterials. This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award will support the acquisition of a Raman confocal microscope to support new cutting-edge nanotechnology research at California State University (CSU), Chico, spurring research and educational activities in the fields of engineering, materials, energy, computer science, and medicine and benefitting more than 600 students. These research activities could enable societal benefits -- ranging from high-strength, efficient, and smart materials to targeted drug delivery systems. The acquisition of a Raman confocal microscope will enable the development of coursework introducing undergraduate students, many of whom come from underrepresented groups, to cutting-edge technological fields. The microscope will also enable cross-disciplinary collaborations, enhance CSU, Chico's collaborations with City University of New York and Sandia National Laboratory and may promote new partnerships with other research institutions and with industry.  These interactions enhance CSU, Chico's research capabilities and give students an opportunity to work with researchers in other institutions. \r\n\r\nRaman spectroscopy allows the chemical composition of materials to be determined non-destructively by analyzing their atomic level response to a laser via Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering and it is the gold standard for material characterization in a wide range of scientific fields. CSU, Chico faculty will use the instrumentation to advance fundamental research on the synthesis and characterization of nanoparticles, the design of DNA nanostructures, the synthesis and characterization of metal-organic graphene analogues, the fabrication and characterization of nanoscale semiconductor materials, devices, and nanosensors, scaffold development for tissue engineering, and in characterization of plant-based enzymes.  For example, to enable breakthroughs in qualification and process control in AM/3D printing processes of polymer-nanoparticle composite materials, the researchers will analyze geometry flaws, external and internal defects, porosity at the micro- and nano-meter level and the texture of inside and outside surfaces to develop information for enhanced modeling of AM printing processes. Researchers will use XRD and XCT scans to measure the lattice structure, analyze the defects inside nanoparticle-polymer composite materials and predict where a lattice-structure may become distorted or break during printing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
