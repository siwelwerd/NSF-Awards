 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Lincoln University will develop and implement an interdisciplinary undergraduate degree in bioinformatics. Very few undergraduate institutions have programs in bioinformatics, particularly Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). This program will have a major impact on the training and preparation of underrepresented minorities for careers in bioinformatics. \r\n\r\nThe Lincoln University Bioinformatics Project will take an innovative approach in bioinformatics education and research by preparing undergraduate students for interdisciplinary and computationally intensive research, and increasing the number of well-qualified underrepresented minority students in graduate programs. Additionally, a pipeline of well-trained minority students who are well prepared for the workforce will be generated from the program. The expected outcomes of this project will advance knowledge in the field of bioinformatics, as the students will be trained in this growing field while working side-by-side with faculty. Therefore, it is necessary to instill a practical understanding of bioinformatics, incorporating its basic usage and critical understanding of the underlying principles. The minimum skill sets are key cross-disciplinary concepts, involving a combination of knowledge and proficiency from the fields of biology, chemistry, computer science, and mathematics, which will have implications in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
