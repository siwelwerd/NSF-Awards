 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Aspen Global Change Institute (AGCI) will host a week-long interdisciplinary scientific workshop in Spring 2020 entitled \"Arctic Climate and Weather Extremes: Detection, Attribution, and Future Projection\". Participants will be tasked with the scientific objectives of a) providing improved insight into the fundamental processes of each climate system component involved in extreme events, b) synthesizing results to improve understanding of feedback processes across the climate system components, c) identifying existing key questions and knowledge gaps, and d) suggesting a way forward to improve our ability to predict and model extremes in the Arctic. To achieve these objectives, The PIs will employ AGCI's established workshop model to convene thirty data analysts, dynamicists, and modelers from the atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice communities. Participants will include early career scientists, and individuals from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds.\r\n \r\nThe trajectory of Arctic climate system change has exhibited highly nonlinear behavior, as manifested by the increased frequency of occurrence of extreme events superimposed on a long-term trend towards a warmer mean state. The most recent, striking extreme events include occurrences of record minima of sea ice extent in the summers of 2007, 2012, and 2016, and record maxima of surface air temperatures in the winters of 2015/2016 and 2017/2018. However, Arctic climate change studies have predominantly focused on the long-term changes or trends using monthly, seasonal, or annual mean data. But extreme events generally occur intermittently for periods from days to several months as outliers of the long-term trends. Even for the extreme events that occur across longer time periods, monthly or seasonal mean data may not be able to resolve the underlying physics supporting their rapid development. It therefore still remains unclear why these extreme events occur, what their multi-scale driving mechanisms are, and where the source of their predictability exists. This workshop seeks to address these critical knowledge gaps.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The workshop was co-chaired by Xiangdong Zhang (U Alaska Fairbanks), Kent Moore (University of Toronto, Canada), Annette Rinke (Alfred-Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research, Germany), and Timo Vihma (Finish Meteorological Institute, Finland). Participants represented a diversity of disciplines including observationalists, dynamicists, and modelers, from the fields of atmospheric physics and dynamics, physical oceanography, and sea ice.&nbsp;The purpose of the workshop was to address outstanding questions about the fundamental physical processes underlying extreme events in the Arctic and their prediction and predictability.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>AGCI staff worked with workshop co-chairs over the course of a year on participant recruitment, agenda development, and facilitation of planning efforts. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the workshop was postponed from its original dates in June 2021, to June 2022. The workshop was held in-person with Covid-19 safety protocols in place. AGCI staff also provided logistical and financial support for participants including support for their travel expenses, lodging, meals and per diem. AGCI staff arranged a workshop meeting space, audio-visual tech support, group activities and meals, and video documentation of workshops. Because the workshop had both in-person and virtual options for participation, AGCI staff also led virtual facilitation and tech support for all virtual participants.</p>\n<p>The workshop also included a public lecture as an additional means of engaging broader audiences on the societal relevance of global change research topics. As part of the workshop, a public lecture was given by participant Heidi Sevestre (AMAP) on ?How Science Communication can Move Mountains: The Last Tropical Glaciers.? The public lectures was held live for in-person and virtual audiences with a global audience of over a hundred viewers.</p>\n<p>The workshop was designed to create a forum wherein observationalists and modelers from across atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice, could examine detection and attribution of Arctic extreme events in the context of interactions among climate system components within the Arctic and between the Arctic and larger Earth system. Participants repeatedly reflected on how rare an opportunity it was to engage for a sustained amount of time across disciplines in this manner, and how critically it is needed to successfully evaluate such complex and interconnected processes.</p>\n<p>A primary output from the workshop is a scientific paper in preparation for submission to <em>Nature Reviews Earth &amp; Environment</em>, presenting a summary of the state of knowledge, indicating research gaps, and recommending follow-up research priorities. The ideas and new collaborations generated at the workshop will carry on in the individual and organizational research priorities of those who attended.</p>\n<p>A blog post entitled, \"Learning from extreme events: The wide-ranging consequences of Arctic change,\" was also authored by AGCI staff based on interviews with workshop participants, Heidi Sevestre, Xiangdong Zhang, and Cecilia Bitz. It is available on AGCI's website:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.agci.org/blog/consequences-of-arctic-change\">https://www.agci.org/blog/consequences-of-arctic-change</a></p>\n<p>The workshop provided professional development opportunities for all participants, especially for early career researchers (AGCI defines this as within 7 years of their terminal educational degree).
