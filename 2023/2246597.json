 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a protective face mask to reduce the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 and other airborne diseases.  The proposed technology is based on a surface coating that repels droplets containing viral particles. The treated mask may reduce spread by limiting the transformation of fluids that are passed on through cough or contact.   Target customers include those that provide services in a medical environment such as hospitals, doctors, clinicians, pharmacies, as well as key manufacturers of face mask products. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of face masks coated with a hydrophobic surface to reduce the spread of viruses including the virus that is the causative agent of COVID-19. The proposed technology may repel droplets containing viral particles while significantly reducing exposure time.  The proposed technology is based on coating low-dimensional metal oxide nanostructures on fabric face masks.  The goal is to coat fabric face masks on the outer surface with metal oxide nanowires synthesized using hydrothermal techniques.  Surface coverage, density, thickness, and aspect ratio of metal oxide nanostructures will be optimized to hydrophobically repel the virus particles.  Static and dynamic contact angle measurement tools will be employed to characterize the surface interactions of water and fabric face masks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
