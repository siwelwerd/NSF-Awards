 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a single-step preparation of a special class of materials, chitin nanofillers, from biomass waste such as shrimp shells. The preparation process demonstrates increased safety by utilizing environmentally friendly solvents of high stability in place of boiling acid, which is currently employed in repurposing biomass waste. The process also eliminates the disposal of acidic waste, reduces scale-up issues, and minimizes production costs. There is a unique commercial opportunity for these materials as they exhibit mechanical strength and are suitable additives for the preparation of high-performance plastics. This technology may ultimately result in sustainable products such as high-end plastics that form nylon.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the use of chitinous waste to prepare chitin nanofillers and the subsequently use of these materials to impart strength in commodity plastics. Specifically, this technology is a one-step method for obtaining chitin nanofillers by direct treatment with a specific solvent. The process reduces the amount of chemicals required and decreases the volume of process waste while avoiding the need to handle the boiling acidic solutions that are used in traditional preparation of chitin nanofillers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
