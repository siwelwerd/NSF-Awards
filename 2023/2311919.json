 "awd_abstract_narration": "Argovis is a website and database (argovis.colorado.edu) which allows, for the first time, easy access to user-selected regional and temporal subsets of ocean and weather data relevant for the study of Earth\u2019s climate and ocean biogeochemistry, enhancing co-location capabilities across these data and accelerating climate science workflows, outreach, and education. Data in Argovis can be visualized on the browser or can be imported directly in the programming environment of choice for scientific analysis. With its emphasis on facilitating data access and co-location capabilities across datasets, Argovis is well positioned to facilitate multidisciplinary research, support community efforts that benefit society, and play a key role towards increasing use of ocean knowledge and understanding by increasing ocean literacy across diverse stakeholders, which is one of the desired outcomes of the 2021-2030 United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.\r\n\r\nThis project implements a sustainability strategy for Argovis that ensures the long-term stability of the tools and resources Argovis provides users with, leveraging long-term computational and maintenance resources at different institutions. Also, working with educators, Argovis creates and disseminates educational activities that utilize data in support of teaching and diversity in science, allowing students with different backgrounds to participate in activities that leverage large and complex dataset relevant for the study of Earth\u2019s climate, including from regions with low bandwidth internet connections (as Argovis provides targeted searches). These educational activities are also useful to spin up outreach efforts and new research projects (hence promote the progress of science). Argovis can be useful to communities looking to organize and share data beyond those relevant for climate science and physical oceanography, by providing a template for the structure and distribution of any geolocated data.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Division of Research, Innovation, Synergies, and Education (RISE), Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE), and Office of Polar Programs (OPP) within the Directorate for Geosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
