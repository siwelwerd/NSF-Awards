 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a plasma reactor that facilitates the production of sustainable fertilizers and various value-added chemicals using renewable and grid electricity. The proposed environmentally conscious approach has the potential to decrease CO2 emissions linked to traditional fertilizer production, and mitigate climate change.  In addition, the proposed technology is scalable, which may allow small-scale farms, including those in disadvantaged communities, to produce their own fertilizer, stabilizing nutrient prices and supply while minimizing the environmental impact of transportation. The commercial impact of this project extends beyond fertilizer production, as the technology may be harnessed to generate a wide range of valuable chemicals for different industries.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a plasma reactor that uses gases, water, and renewable electricity as inputs to generate various chemicals such as nitrates, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide.  The proposed core technology, referred to as plasma reforming, employs low-temperature plasmas as catalysts for chemical transformations, concentrating on converting air and water into highly liquid fertilizers. Designed as a one-step process for direct nitrogen fixation, the technology eliminates the need for secondary process stages. It may operate intermittently, be controlled remotely, and its modular design supports scalability from kilowatt to megawatt power loads. The proposed plasma reactor technology is suitable for both small-scale and large-scale production, permitting easy expansion as demand for chemicals and electrical load increases.  The plasma reactor may also be used to generate other chemicals such as hydrogen, methanol, and ammonia, which are used in a wide range of industrial and commercial applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
