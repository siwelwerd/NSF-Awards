 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Workshop on Modeling & Simulation of Systems and Applications (ModSim) is an annual event that brings together researchers from academia, industry, and government to discuss the latest developments and trends in modeling and simulation. The 2023 ModSim workshop will focus on Disruptive Technologies, exploring the latest developments and trends in computing and modeling, as well as the challenges and opportunities that come with them.\r\n\r\nAttending the ModSim workshop will provide students with several benefits, including the opportunity to network with colleagues from around the world, present and receive feedback on their research, and learn about the latest developments in ModSim. This funding will help to increase the diversity of attendees at the workshop, by providing travel grants to students who may not have been able to attend otherwise. This will promote the participation of underrepresented groups in the ModSim research community, leading to a more inclusive and collaborative field.\r\nApproximately 13 students will attend the workshop and benefit from its educational and networking opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
