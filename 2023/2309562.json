 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Groups of Dynamical Origin, Automata and Spectra Conference\" will take place March 19-24, 2023, at the SwissMAP Research Station, Les Diablerets, Switzerland. The conference follows a long tradition of schools and workshops on Geometric Group Theory and beyond in the Swiss Alps. The 2023 conference's interplay of three subjects: dynamics of group actions, spectra of operators on graphs, and automata theory, will draw the interest of PhD students studying not only geometric group theory, but also low dimensional topology and metric geometry, as well as combinatorics. The interdisciplinary nature of the conference will engage novel pedagogical methods. The conference will extend the traditional form of minicourses across different subjects, giving each minicourse a vantage opportunity to reflect different ways to attack a certain problem. A single minicourse's lectures will be given by different specialists, each offering his or her own perspective. Ph.D. students will also benefit from the planned informal discussions, tutorials, and group research work. The NSF funds awarded will serve to defray the travel costs of US participants. The organizers will give priority to graduate students and early career mathematicians, as well as participants from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conference will cover a wide range of related topics from geometric and combinatorial group theory, ring theory, complex dynamics, and other areas. The conference's benefits extend beyond the mere reporting on recent research developments. The conference will bring together a wide variety of researchers, from established leaders to graduate students and early career mathematicians. Given the presence of the large number of researchers working in adjacent areas at this conference, the organizers anticipate highly productive interdisciplinary interactions. The purpose of the conference is to expose and train researchers in the many facets of geometric group theory and dynamical systems, and to forge new and productive collaborative relationships. The conference plans to provide a wide variety of the latest research, methodologies, techniques, and valuable tools to young researchers and all participants. The SwissMAP Research Station has all the facilities to accommodate the planned conference.\r\n\r\nThe website of the conference is available at http://sites.google.com/view/griorchuk70/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
