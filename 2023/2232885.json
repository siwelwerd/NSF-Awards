 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will partially support the Field of Dreams Conferences that will run November 4-6, 2022 and will be held on the Minneapolis campus of the University of Minnesota.  The Field of Dreams Conference is organized by the Math Alliance, an organization whose goal is to increase the number of doctoral students from backgrounds underrepresented in the mathematical sciences, and the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications. Approximately 100 undergraduate and Master's degree students will attend the conference, about 80% of whom will be underrepresented minorities, along with 200 additional participants. All funds from this award will be used to pay the cost of attendance for some of these students. The conference coordinates with the Math Alliance's Facilitated Graduate Admissions Process (F-GAP), which has helped place an average of about 80 Math Alliance Scholars per year in graduate programs the last six years with very good retention to this point. The conference is an essential part of a program to produce a more diverse professional mathematical workforce. In addition, there are events at the conference that assist faculty in mentoring practices and help academic departments transform their cultures to be more inclusive and supportive of student success.\r\n\r\nThe Field of Dreams conference has several purposes, including: providing information about all aspects of the mathematical sciences professions to students wishing to pursue doctoral studies; providing information about summer research programs and opportunities at the NSF-funded Mathematical Sciences Institutes; facilitating appropriate placement of Math Alliance students in graduate programs; providing professional development in mentoring and cultural competence for our Math Alliance faculty; and serving as a clearinghouse for employment opportunities for new (and recent) Math Alliance doctoral recipients. More information about the Math Alliance is available at www.mathalliance.org. Material from previous years' conferences, are available at https://mathalliance.org/field-of-dreams-conference/, and the page for the 2022 conference is https://mathalliance.org/2022-field-of-dreams-conference/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
