The meeting will take place in fall 2023 on the campus of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah. The meeting will convene the principal investigators (PIs) of active awards within the Community Infrastructure for Research in CISE (CIRC) program, formerly known as the CISE Community Research Infrastructure (CCRI) program. It will be a venue where PIs, local government and community organization representatives, and Federal agency representatives meet to present and review CIRC progress and developments, identify new and emerging areas for research infrastructure, and discuss research infrastructure gaps and barriers. The meeting agenda includes plenary presentations of showcase CIRC projects, poster presentations by all PIs, reports of recent program activities, a keynote address, a panel discussion, and breakout discussions on topics to be determined by the community.\r\n\r\nThe annual PI Meeting is the primary opportunity for NSF-funded CIRC/CCRI PIs to meet as a group to share their progress, discuss research infrastructure opportunities and challenges, and explore new ideas and partnerships for future work. It is a forum for sharing ideas across the CIRC community. It is also an opportunity for the academic community to interact with government agencies with interest in CIRC developments and advancements. The CIRC/CCRI PI Meeting series has played a major role in growing the community across a broad range of sectors and technologies, and in performing outreach to parties who have interest in learning about the program and participating as future proposers, transition partners, or sponsors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
