 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel award supports the participation of junior and senior US researchers in the program \u201cNew statistical physics in living matter: non equilibrium states under adaptive control\u201d that takes place July-December 2023 at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences of the University of Cambridge, UK. The program will initiate discussions among a wide range of researchers about the fundamental physics and mathematical modeling of biological systems, with a focus on active, far-from-equilibrium properties and the consequences of these for adaptive control. The interdisciplinary nature of the research can impact a variety of fields from materials science and engineering, physics, applied mathematics, biology to medicine. About one third of the more than 100 participants will be from US institutions, including 10-15 junior researchers. The program includes four week-long workshops, consisting of typically 24 invited and 15-20 contributed talks that emphasize representation of younger scientists and underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
