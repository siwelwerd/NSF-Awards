 "awd_abstract_narration": "Galaxies like the Milky Way are steadily forming stars, yet such galaxies will eventually end star formation and \"quench\". The physical drivers of how star formation ends in galaxies are not well understood, but the supermassive black holes that are found in the centers of massive galaxies may play a key role. The project will use tracers of time-variable emission from the areas illuminated by central supermassive black holes in galaxies to study the impact on galaxies which have recently ended star formation. The project will provide crucial context for understanding the galaxies discovered at larger distances with current and near-future facilities such as JWST, 20-40 meter ground-based telescopes, and the next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA). The project includes time spent developing and implementing programs for the University of Illinois Astronomy summer camp. This camp is aimed at girls in grades 10-12, though students of any gender can apply. We will design and implement activities for students to explore the changing sky with time-series data to explore goal-setting methods.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of galaxies from star-forming to quiescent is fundamental to the build-up of the observed galaxy population. There is growing evidence that many galaxies, especially at high redshift, experience this transition during a period of rapid change. Feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) can provide enough energy to end star formation, yet the role of AGN activity and the mechanisms by which it can end star formation remain uncertain. We propose to use post-starburst galaxies identified at low redshift as laboratories for studying how and when AGN feedback might act. These galaxies have experienced recent bursts of star formation that have ended suddenly within the last billion years, analogous to the dramatic quenching seen in high redshift massive quiescent galaxies. AGN activity is difficult to measure during the post-starburst phase due to the uncertain nature of many commonly-used AGN tracers as well as the inherent variability of AGN. The PIs will study the presence of AGN activity during the post-starburst phase using tracers sensitive to a range of timescales. They will use archival and targeted optical and radio observations to study optical variability on timescales of weeks-years, radio variability on timescales of years-decades, and extreme changes in state over periods of 10,000-100,000 years using extended ionized regions. Their results will provide crucial context for future observations of higher redshift evolving galaxies, for which the community will soon obtain deep rest-frame optical spectroscopy with JWST and 20-40m ground-based telescopes, and cold molecular gas measurements with the ngVLA. Utilizing time-domain observations in multiple wavelengths will allow the field of galaxy evolution to maximize the scientific return on the investment in time domain astrophysics recommended in the Astro2020 decadal survey report.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
