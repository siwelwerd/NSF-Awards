 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academy of Sciences will conduct a consensus study on the role of K-12 education in supporting the development of competencies for data and computing. There are many skills and competencies for the various computing-related disciplines, like computer science, data science, artificial intelligence, and even computational skills in other STEM disciplines more broadly. However, there has been little attention to identify which set of these skills are foundational competencies required for students to succeed in a computational world. This project aims to serve the national interest by identifying these foundational skills and describing K-12 education's role in teaching these skills. The project intends to produce a National Academies report that identifies the foundational competencies needed for data and computing, the learning progressions needed to reach these competencies, and provide guidance on the design of the relevant learning experiences so that students can navigate and succeed in the changing computational landscape. The project will adopt a systemic approach toward advancing equity in computing related fields and will identify promising directions for changes in policy and practice, for pedagogical improvement, and areas where additional research is needed.\r\n\r\nThe project hopes to advance understanding of the the role of K\u201312 in supporting the development of competencies for data and computing. The proejct will be conducted according to the consensus study format of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The Board on Science Education in collaboration with the Board on Higher Education and the Workforce will convene an expert committee to conduct a consensus study to: 1) identify the foundational competencies needed for data and computing (including basic literacy) and consider the relationship to other STEM fields; 2) consider the learning progressions needed to reach these competencies (basic literacy and career pursuit) and the design of relevant learning experiences; 3) provide guidance on implications for K\u201312 curricula and program/pathway development; and 4) identify research needs to provide an evidence base for the development of computing-related competencies. During the course of the project, extensive outreach will be carried out to gather input from stakeholders and to cultivate relationships that will broaden the impact of the final report. The NSF CSforAll Program supports supports partnerships and research that seek to provide U.S. students with the opportunity to engage in computer science and computational thinking education at the preK-12 levels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
