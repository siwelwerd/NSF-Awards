 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacteria produce polymers when there is excess carbon. Bacterial carbon storage polymers are referred to as PHAs. PHAs are biodegradable and exhibit useful material properties. Recovering PHAs from bacteria is a major hurdle. The primary objective of the project is to develop a cell-free method for PHA synthesis. This would greatly simplify the recovery process and would increase the yield of the polymer from natural feedstocks. Enzymes from a novel thermophilic bacteria will perform the cell-free synthesis. The productivity of that system will be characterized. Undergraduates from nearby tribal colleges will be recruited to participate in the research. They will be supported by a series of professional development online workshops developed as part of this project.\r\n\r\nThis project will establish a proof-of-concept to rewire the synthesis of PHAs as an extracellular product. To accomplish this, several intermediate steps are anticipated. First is the single-step consolidated bioconversion of agri-materials into PHA precursors by engineering a non-model microbial strain to synthesize C6-C12 hydroxy acids from unprocessed corn stover. Next is cell-free enzymatic polymerization of these acids into PHA using thermostable enzymes from the model strain. Finally, purification of the synthesized biopolymers using green ionic liquids.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
