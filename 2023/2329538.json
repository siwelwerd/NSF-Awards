 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PROMISE program will support three postdoctoral fellows focused on equity and social justice in all aspects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education research, practice, and policy at the higher education level. PROMISE Fellows will tap into ongoing research, structures and projects in the Department of Engineering and Science Education (ESED) at Clemson University, as well as other campus- and state-wide resources. They will be mentored by ESED faculty and experts in STEM communication. Through program activities, PROMISE Fellows will build their identity as inclusive STEM educators and incorporate social justice into their own areas of interest and expertise. This project is designed to contribute to STEM education by providing insights to policy-makers on issues of equity and social justice in STEM education at regional, state and federal levels and by preparing the next generation of STEM educators and mentors to emerging scholars from diverse populations.   \r\n\r\nPROMISE will leverage existing projects and national networks of STEM education researchers and policy makers to enable Fellows to connect fundamental and applied research in the context of social justice in STEM education. PROMISE will employ a cognitive apprenticeship approach to provide the content and applied practice, and will draw on Black Feminist Thought to provide a mentoring structure necessary for Fellows to build robust research portfolios. Mentored teaching experiences for those seeking to expand their teaching portfolio will include classroom observations, instruction, and guidance on implementing inclusive and innovative pedagogical methods. Opportunities to advance knowledge and policy in STEM education include workshops and symposia on research methods, social justice, STEM education policy, and STEM communication, culminating with the Fellows writing a grant proposal to fund and conduct a STEM Education Policy Summit in Columbia South Carolina. PROMISE Fellows will present their research and discuss STEM education policy and action with lawmakers, policy advocates and community stakeholders. PROMISE Fellows will acquire expertise in education research methods, contribute to the research literature, and participate in scholarly and policy-related communities.   \r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program (STEM Ed PRF) in partnership with the EDU Core Research Building Capacity in STEM Education Research Program (ECR: BCSER) and the EDU Core Research (ECR) Program. The STEM Ed PRF Program aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied research that advances knowledge within the field. The ECR:BCSER Program is designed to build investigators\u2019 capacity to carry out high-quality STEM education research.  The ECR Program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
