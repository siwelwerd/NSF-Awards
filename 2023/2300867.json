 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will help to address the Nation\u2019s need for skilled cybersecurity professionals by developing a Cyber Data Analytics technician workforce development program. This program will deliver a blended education of cybersecurity and data science that will cover the risks, threats, and vulnerabilities faced by small businesses. The project will focus on associate degree students and will extend Cyber Data Analytics across multiple disciplines, by offering industry relevant courses to students from degree programs in business, healthcare, accounting, electronics, and criminal justice. A novel component of this project is the creation of culturally responsive curriculum content that will be localized for Hawaiian traditions and customs. This project will produce evidence-based modules for teaching Cyber Data Analytics that can be incorporated into existing curriculum in community colleges. \r\n\r\nThe project will add to the knowledge base for technician education by studying the impact of this program on teachers and students. Moreover, the research will examine what aspects of the program increase student completion and job placement. Four objectives will guide the work of the project team. First is to create four new courses and a new online Certificate for Cyber Data Analytics. Second is to provide opportunities for students in non-computing associate degree programs to be introduced to field of Cyber Data Analytics. Third is to train faculty in community colleges in the use of the curriculum modules. Fourth, and finally, is to engage high school teachers in STEM CTE, high school counselors, and students from underrepresented groups such as women and minorities, to participate in entrepreneurship project-based learning opportunities. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
