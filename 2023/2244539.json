 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics at Kansas State University. The site engages twelve students per year in research projects, which include the interaction of laser light with matter at atomic and nanoscale as well as investigations of neutrinos and elementary particle collisions and physics education research. A wide range of projects are available from faculty mentors that involve the undergraduates in state-of-the-art research. Previous student have reported being better informed decisions about careers, graduate work and/or professional school. Whether they choose to continue in physics or a related technical field, or choose to move to a different area, bright students making good choices early in their careers is in the national interest.\r\n\r\nStudents will do research on how atoms and molecules behave in intense and ultra-fast optical and x-ray pulses, how high-performance computation can be used to predict molecular properties and dynamics, the properties of nanoparticles in solution, and protein self-assembly with simplified models, and will help build next-generation hardware for high-energy particle detection, improve measurements of neutrino oscillations, and help faculty use research-based assessment tools. This experience will be supplemented by a series of lectures that provide the background these students need to carry out their projects. The participants will gain experience in explaining their research work to a variety of colleagues. Social activities, both organized and spontaneous, will enrich this undergraduate research experience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
