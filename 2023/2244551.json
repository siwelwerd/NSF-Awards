 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational modeling and thinking as a way of solving complex problems has the potential to impact society through a student's professional career contributions. The project teaches students the fundamental skills of computational modeling and thinking that will help them understand and solve applicable problems in the real world. Students participate in multi-disciplinary, community-based, computational modeling research projects to serve and enhance Portland and its greater region. Through their projects and through interactions with their community partners, students are gaining an understanding of the potential and limits of computational tools and how they can serve diverse communities. The virtual nature of the project allows the site to broaden participation and for students to participate from anywhere in the US. The firsthand and applied nature of the research projects attracts and motivates a diverse population of students to pursue a STEM career. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual focus of this virtual REU site is computational modeling to serve and enhance Portland and its greater region. Computational modeling and thinking are not limited to the use of information technology; it is a way of thinking and solving problems well beyond the traditional computing disciplines. Students participate in multi-disciplinary, community-based research projects to gain experience in computational thinking across different disciplines. The activities of this REU site involve a 2-week training followed by an 8-week research project completed under a faculty mentor's guidance and with the involvement of a community partner. The site recruits a diverse population of students across disciplines from institutions with limited research opportunities as well as tribal colleges and universities. The virtual nature of the site allows the recruitment of students who are unable to travel. The REU Site teaches students the fundamental skills of computational modeling and thinking that help them understand and solve applied research problems in the real world.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
