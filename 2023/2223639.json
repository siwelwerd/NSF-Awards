 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in providing solutions to farmers who are facing the culmination of decades of herbicide resistant weed species evolving from applications of synthetic herbicides. Creation of herbicides which are effective, naturally produced, scalable, and deployed using the current agronomic practices could alter the foundations of crop production in the United States and around the world. In view of the projected 8% annual increase in global food and agriculture market, shrinking areas under cultivation that lead to the need for higher productivity per acre, and increasing demand for nutritional food items, the need for sustainable alternatives to current synthetic herbicides that do not promote herbicide resistant weeds is becoming clearer. Widespread adoption of the proposed technology is expected to benefit farmers and crop producers reducing societal strain, financial burden, and environmental stress from crop losses due to herbicide resistant weeds by eliminating these weeds through an environmentally safe method, without the use of excess fuel, time, equipment, and synthetic herbicides.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is in developing a novel natural herbicide product that, when applied to herbicide resistant weeds, will cause seed or plant cell's membranes to degrade and lose integrity. Thus, the novel product is intended to work both as pre-emergent weed prevention and post-emergent weed control herbicide. The product will be an environmentally safe blend of natural plant extracts and excipients. The herbicide formulations will be sprayable onto soil or onto plant leaves and stems. The cost and time needed to initially screen herbicide rates, outcomes, and best practices typically is many years. The greenhouse screening approach takes months and provides valuable information to ensure that field trials, which are more expensive and impacted by changes in weather, are efficient in cost and outcomes. This project will initially focus on greenhouse validation of weed control of the most resistant weeds known in different geographical locations in the U.S. Dose response data for 50%-to-90% inhibition control/efficacy of herbicide resistant weeds will provide the information to develop a herbicide use label, directions for best practices, and good stewardship by using only the amount of herbicide needed for control without overuse.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

(Harpe Bio) is developing a novel natural product chemical treatment platform for farmers and producers against a wide variety of herbicide resistant weeds in conventional row crops, organic production crops, and non-crop situations. Harpe Bioherbicides introduces new and unique MOA-SOA compounds which have no known resistance in weeds. Harpe Bio has a platform of products designed for use in OMRI certified organic as well as conventional non-organic crops. Harpe Bioherbicides are based on natural products, having a high level of safety to the user, crop, and environment.\n\n\nHerbicide resistant weeds are defined as a weed species that has mutated to survive herbicide applications that previously controlled it. They have had profound economical, agricultural and environmental impacts in the 21st century. Herbicide-resistant weeds impact nearly every acre of crops in the U.S. and around the globe and are a key driver for the need to innovate; USA -- $33 billion in lost crop production annually, UK  400 million and 800,000 tons of lost wheat yield each year.\n\n\nWeed resistance to herbicides, especially multiple-herbicide resistance, poses a serious threat to global food production. Current levels of herbicide resistance are growing and now directly impacting the ability of growers to produce crops. Recent examples include multiple herbicide resistant Kochia, Palmer amaranth, Waterhemp, and certain grasses are concerning as there are few if any herbicides to control these weeds once they emerge from the soil.\n\n\nResults and Discussion of NSF Findings\n\n\nHarpe Bio. sought out open-source herbicide resistant weed seeds for testing. Establishment of these seeds in a greenhouse environment for screening of Harpe Bio. products to control herbicide resistant weeds. Weeds of note which were grown and tested using Harpe Bio. products include Kochia, Palmer Amaranth, and annual ryegrass. Harpe Bio. products controlled the resistant weeds and a series of non-resistant weeds using a sprayer simulating field spray treatments. The weeds in question were not controlled by the widely used synthetic herbicides for which these weeds were known to be resistant. Harpe Bio. formulations controlled each of the weed species using spray application simulating Organic grower use patterns and for conventional crop growers. The ability of Harpe Bio. formulations and products for control of herbicide resistant weeds in a greenhouse setting will allow the transition to field research trials to continue to develop Harpe Bio. products for sale to farmers in the US.\n\n\nControlling multi-herbicide resistant weeds in conventional crops, which include corn, soybean, wheat-cereals, rice, cotton, peanuts, and a series of tree-nut-vine based perennial crops is key for advancing Harpe Bio. products to support farmers.\n\n\nHarpe Bio. tested a series of essential synthetic herbicides which are no longer effective against the very weeds which are now resistant to these herbicides. Harpe Bio.s natural product formulations were tested alone and in combination with these herbicides to assess the control of the multi-herbicide resistant weeds. These combinations of products are used to develop a series of products for grower use against the problem weeds. Good herbicide stewardship necessitates the use of multiple, effective herbicides against weeds, thus controlling the weeds which are present in the fields and reducing the potential for herbicide resistant weeds to develop in the treated populations. Outcomes from the testing included confirmation of Harpe Bio. formulations being effective against the resistant weed species. Outcomes also showed that Harpe Bio. formulations can be used in conjunction with the synthetic herbicides for improved efficacy and total control of the herbicide resistant weed species tested.\n\n\nSimilar results from the pairing of Harpe Bio. formulations with total control herbicides which are no longer effective against grass species including annual ryegrass. Harpe Bio. formulation combinations with the synthetic-total control herbicides achieved complete control of the resistant grass species. This is a key outcome for control of germinated, established grass species which have evolved resistance to nearly all herbicides.\n\n\nHarpe Bio. is continuing to innovate and test proprietary natural product concepts for controlling multi-herbicide resistant weed species which are taking over crop fields, non-crop areas, organic crops, nature/natural areas, and grassland/grazing areas of the US. Meeting a key need for growers, landowners, federal, state and local municipalities which are seeking new, natural solutions for weed control and environmental sustainability.\n\n\nThis Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) for this award.
