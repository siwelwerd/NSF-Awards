 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship project is focused on an investigation of the impact of atmospheric ozone on biogenic volatile organic compound emissions, leaf wax morphology, and plant physiology. By increasing the understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind ozone exposure and damage to plants, improvements can be made in the ability to predict impacts from ozone air pollution on crops.\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on two overlapping areas of uncertainty: how atmospheric ozone (O3) pollution impacts both plant productivity and plant emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC). The objectives of this research are to: (1) quantify the impacts of O3 exposure on plant physiology, (2) identify how O3 exposure changes the temperature and the carbon dioxide (CO2) dependence of BVOC emissions and plant physiology, (3) quantify the impacts of O3 exposure on BVOC emissions, and (4) determine the ability of plants to recover from O3 stress.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research include a library exhibit and workshops targeted toward educating students in grades 4-6. An educational pamphlet on ozone pollution will be created and made available to teachers and the public through web pages and the library.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
