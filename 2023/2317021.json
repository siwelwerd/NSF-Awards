 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation Program and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program. Georgia Gwinnett College, a Primarily Undergraduate and Hispanic Serving Institution, is acquiring an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) to support novel research of faculty and undergraduate students in the chemical, biological, and environmental sciences. The instrument will be used in the interdisciplinary research efforts of Dr. Kathryn Zimmermann and 10 additional colleagues. Inductively coupled mass spectrometry has the ability to simultaneously measure multiple elements, such as dissolved metals, across a wide range of concentrations. This technique is then, essential for measuring trace elements in a variety of sample matrices. This instrument, not widely found at undergraduate institutions, is commonly used in industry, enhancing its importance for training and research use by a diverse group of undergraduate research students.\r\n\r\nThe inductively coupled mass spectrometer will be used to enhance the undergraduate research infrastructure at Georgia Gwinnett College, and will also be employed in upper-level course-embedded research experiences (CUREs). The instrument will support research in several areas including: a) investigation of metal sources and concentrations in atmospheric particulate matter; b) microchemical analysis of local fish and their migratory habitats; c) detection of ions in membrane fouling in water treatment; d) trace metals in food samples; e) measurement of concentrations of metals in local freshwater and marine waterways in efforts to inform mitigation/remediation efforts;  f) development of functionalized wood for bioremediation of metals in aqueous samples; and g) analysis of waste oil and grease, biodiesel, and combustion products for heavy metal concentrations. This proposed shared-use instrument will enable the advancement and evolution of research projects at Georgia Gwinnett College and is also expected to be used, collaboratively, by other regional institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
