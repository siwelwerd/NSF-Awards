 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project responds to two national imperatives -- the national security concerns arising from the reliance on computing components manufactured abroad and the need for engagement of underdeveloped and underutilized pools of talent in the STEM workforce.  The project is a partnership between a university, non-profit community organizations, a national laboratory and industry to prepare individuals from underrepresented minority groups with the skills necessary to start new careers in the semiconductor and microelectronics industry in Chicagoland by reskilling workers through a series of compensated experiential learning activities. The results of the project include the creation of a diverse and competitive high technology workforce in the emergent and growing semiconductor and microelectronics industry in Illinois -- a region historically well-suited for industrial production but long challenged by the effects of deindustrialization from globalization. The semiconductor industry is critical to economic competitiveness and national security. By supplying an educated and ready workforce in Illinois, the project helps to improve national security through the domestic production of semiconductors and microelectronics and through the diversification of the location of their manufacturing in Illinois and the Midwest.\r\n\r\nThere are five goals of the project: increased awareness of career opportunities in the local semiconductor and microelectronics industry for individuals from underrepresented minority groups, increased participation of individuals from underrepresented minority groups in the U.S. semiconductor and microelectronics industry, provision of experiential learning opportunities and culturally responsive support for working adults to transition into new careers in semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing , increased economic development of the Chicagoland region in the area of high technology and support of national security interests of the U.S. by developing a diverse domestic workforce prepared to work in semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing. These goals are accomplished through a four-phase model of educational experiences along with a mentorship and support program.  Phase 1 provides foundational knowledge of semiconductors and microelectronics through hands-on activities provided in classroom/small laboratory settings; Phase 2 is the completion of an experiment or project at a national laboratory; Phase 3 is a mini-internship at an employer in the semiconductor and microelectronics industry; and Phase 4 is participation in a job fair and developing a professional development plan.  The project will advance the knowledge in workforce development by generating promising practices about reskilling individuals from underrepresented minority groups and their entry into careers in the microelectronics and semiconductor industry. This project aligns with the NSF ExLENT Program, funded by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, as it seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals from diverse professional and educational backgrounds to increase their interest in, and their access to, career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
