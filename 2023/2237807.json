 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth\u2019s magnetic field acts as a shield that protects Earth from dangerous magnetic storms and cosmic radiation which have the potential to damage technical infrastructure, strip away Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and ultimately harm life. Due to its importance to habitability and modern technical infrastructure, it is critical to understand how Earth\u2019s magnetic field has varied through Earth\u2019s past, in addition to how it might change in the future. To do this, it is necessary to characterize the spatial and temporal variations of the magnetic field using paleomagnetism, in which ancient records of the field are measured from rocks. Due to a sparsity of paleomagnetic data and gaps in paleomagnetic education and training, our ability to understand past behavior and predict future behavior is hampered. This project aims to improve the characterization of geomagnetic field behavior by filling in important data gaps in the current paleomagnetic record using a novel recorder of geomagnetic field behavior, clinkers, or rocks baked and burned by coal seam fires from the Powder River Basin, USA. This aim will be further enhanced through the development of a new paleomagnetism general education course and experiential learning research experience on clinkers as part of the University of Florida\u2019s (UF) Quest program, and the development of a paleomagnetism-focused workshop for high-school age 4-H club members as a part of UF Extension Services\u2019 program, 4-H University. These programs will educate a broad and diverse audience in the fields of paleomagnetism and Earth Science, while simultaneously attracting new students to Earth Science degrees, paleomagnetic research, and ultimately the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nDespite being a fundamental feature of our planet, our understanding of Earth\u2019s magnetic field is incomplete. Currently, there are many gaps in the state of knowledge including: 1) what drives the magnetic field? 2) what causes magnetic reversals? and 3) how does the magnetic field vary spatially? These gaps in knowledge are further exacerbated by an education gap. Paleomagnetism can provide insight into multiple geoscience disciplines, yet as a topic it typically receives little attention in geoscience training. This impacts the ability of the geoscience community to understand paleomagnetic research in addition to the ability to fill in critical gaps in understanding of the magnetic field. What is needed to fill in these critical gaps is both more high-quality full-vector (direction and intensity) paleomagnetic data in addition to a trained workforce to collect and analyze these data. The aim of this project is to fill these needs by improving the characterization of recent (0\u20135 Myr) geomagnetic field behavior using a novel recorder of geomagnetic field behavior, clinkers. Clinkers, rocks baked and burned by coal seam fires, are an exciting new candidate for obtaining high-quality full-vector magnetic records as they occur throughout the world, are located in regions lacking magnetic data, can be reliably dated, and are reliable full-vector magnetic recorders. In this project, state-of-the-art paleomagnetic and geochronologic techniques will be utilized, generating a semi-continuous, high-resolution, full-vector record of magnetic field variations for Quaternary to Pliocene (0\u20135 Myr) age clinker deposits from the Powder River Basin (PRB), USA. This research is the first step in building a reliable methodology to expand work on clinker deposits outside of the PRB. The education and outreach components of this project will train the next generation of paleomagnetists, broaden the understanding of paleomagnetic research within the geosciences and the general population, and enhance the participation of underrepresented groups in the field. This project is an early step in a continuum of research and education that will lead to an improved global characterization of the magnetic field. More generally, this project addresses science priority question one, \u201cHow is Earth\u2019s internal field generated?\u201d, released in the National Academies decadal report for NSF-EAR.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
