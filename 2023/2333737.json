 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to create a prototype knowledge graph concentrating on often-undervalued contributors within the science realm, such as individuals, research areas, and organizations affiliated with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and non-Carnegie R1 institutions. The primary objective of this project is to illuminate the expansive research landscape of the US, promote varied collaborations, and provide an open platform for budding research partnerships. The knowledge graph, named CollabNext, utilizes open data sources and infrastructure and integrates AI and machine learning for data processing, while emphasizing human-in-the-loop input to ensure data accuracy and sustainability. A collaborative effort between Georgia Tech, Morehouse, and Clark Atlanta University, CollabNext aims to boost research collaborations through effective data utilization.\r\n\r\nThe project involves a multi-university collaboration and draws upon computational thinking skills, data, and machine learning from various fields. Its focus is on democratizing data for broader societal benefit and the practical application of knowledge graphs. Collaborators range from academic institutions such as Fisk University and Morehouse College to industry and research partners like the Renaissance Computing Institute and TDP Data Systems. CollabNext's effectiveness lies in its integration of diverse knowledge graph entities and its commitment to an inclusive and standardized data infrastructure. By prioritizing feedback from underrepresented researchers, the tool is poised to increase visibility for emerging research institutions, boost research collaborations, and foster a more diverse research workforce. Its comprehensive database will be fully integrated into the Open Knowledge Network, thus establishing a robust data infrastructure for other use cases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
