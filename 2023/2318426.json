 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research looks at whether the collaborative context affects scientific outcomes differently for scientists in different categories, focusing on the generalizability of network theories. Understanding the reasons for disproportionate representation in top positions and different career development patterns is important because science is increasingly a team-based enterprise. Theories about how scientists collaborate often assume that everyone benefits equally from their connections with others, but knowledge production is influenced by status and identity in interactive contexts. This research adds to our understanding of how knowledge is created and shared in global collaborative science communities. It also tackles important issues related to the ongoing efforts to increase participation in STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThis research adopts a network analytic approach using a large-scale bibliographic database. This database is a comprehensive source for citation information that allows for the construction of unbounded co-authorship networks that include intra- and inter-disciplinary co-authorship ties across time and on a global scale. In a set of three inquiries, the researchers examine differences in benefit from resource-rich collaborative ties, through cumulative advantage, and from tendencies toward homophily (status) in collaborative activity over time and during the peak COVID-19 pandemic period. The project also tackles an unresolved puzzle regarding the innovative value of research specialization alongside collaborative brokerage and the interaction effects of specialization and brokerage on innovation and the generation of \u201cgood ideas\u201d. This work has implications not only for scholars of science, but also for the development of science and innovation policy that seeks to bolster the engagement of all scientists in the production of science knowledge and the development of new innovations. Sustaining the career development and collaborative relations of a talented and diverse workforce has implications not only for equitable outcomes in science, but also for national and international economic and social prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe project is co-funded by the Science of Science: Discovery, Communications, and Impact program, the Human Networks and Data Science research program, and the Science of Broadening Participation program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
