Due to their growing usage and highly safety-critical nature, security/privacy problems pose direct threats to passengers, owners, operators, as well as the environment. With the recent global trends in substantially improving vehicle autonomy and connectivity (e.g., autonomous driving, drone delivery, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, intelligent transportation,\r\ndrone swarm), such security/privacy challenges are receiving increasing attention from academia, industry, and policy-makers. To meet this critical need, the ISOC Symposium on Vehicle Security and Privacy (VehicleSec) brings together an audience of university researchers, scientists, industry professionals, and government representatives to contribute to new theories, technologies, and systems on the security/privacy issues vehicles.\r\n\r\nThis event brings together an audience of university researchers, scientists, industry professionals, and government representatives, featuring regular paper sessions, a demo/poster session to allow academic, governmental, and industry participants to present posters and/or share demonstrations of their latest attacks, defenses, and security/privacy tools or systems related to vehicles.  The award supports participation of students without other means of support to attend the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
