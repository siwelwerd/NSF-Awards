 "awd_abstract_narration": "Illicit drug abuse has become another major national health crisis since the Covid-19\r\npandemic started, due to long period of quarantine at home with significantly reduced social\r\ninteractions. In 2022, U.S. drug overdose deaths hit the highest level in history: nearly 110,000\r\npeople died from drug overdose according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The\r\ntop overdose drugs are opioids, cocaine, psychostimulants, and methadone. Mixing multiple drugs\r\ncan also cause drug-drug interactions which may increase the risk of death. The current drug\r\ndetection apparatuses typically require time-consuming, laborious sample preparation procedure\r\nand trained staff. These detection methods are not suitable for monitoring and profiling the current\r\ndrug overdose crisis en masse. This project aims to develop a high throughput, label-free and\r\nportable sensor that can quantitatively detect multiple drugs (opioids, cocaine, psychostimulants,\r\nand methadone) in a liquid sample via a single test. The samples can be collected in the diverse\r\nforms of biofluids such as saliva, urine, sweat and blood. Successful development of this automatic,\r\naccurate, point-of-care platform will greatly simplify and accelerate the drug screen process.\r\n\r\nThe main module of the sensing platform consists of a silver (Ag) or gold (Au) nanoparticle\r\ndecorated Zinc Oxide nanorod coated silica nanofiber matrix (Ag/AuNP-ZnONR-SNF\r\nnanosensor). Machine learning algorithm will be incorporated to achieve the automatic,\r\nquantitative analysis of multiplex detection of the drugs without trained expertise. The objective\r\nof this project will be achieved by accomplishing the following three research tasks: (1)\r\nDevelopment and characterization of the nanosensor material to experimentally demonstrate the\r\nfeasibility of surfaced enhanced plasmonic sensing of drugs using the device. The device is\r\nfabricated by electrospinning of the silica nanofiber as the supporting matrix, hydrothermal growth\r\nof the ZnO nanorod coated on the silica nanofiber, and Ag and Au nanoparticles synthesized by\r\nUV irradiation or seed mediated growth method, respectively, on the surface of the ZnONR-SNF\r\nmatrix. (2) Optimization of the sensing performance, including the sensitivity, limit of detection\r\n(LoD), repeatability and stability of the sensor by tuning the geometries, dimensions, and structure\r\nof the nanomaterials-based sensing module with respect to different biofluidic samples. (3)\r\nDevelopment of machine learning (ML) algorithms using prior-embedded deep neural network\r\nmodels trained by many data samples obtained using our sensor to identify and quantify multiple\r\ndrugs from different sample sources. The successful implementation of the algorithm will allow\r\nfor an accurate, automatic, quick, and multiplex detection of the drugs. This project will provide\r\nnew methodologies and data to address the challenges in understanding and monitoring the current\r\ndrug overdose crisis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
