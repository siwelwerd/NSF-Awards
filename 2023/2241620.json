 "awd_abstract_narration": "The privatization of eldercare has greatly aggravated the financial burden of elders. Without adequate social and familial support, many elders turn to financial and legal instruments as they plan for their late-life care. This doctoral dissertation research investigates how older adults navigate, engage with, and reshape financial and legal settings as they conduct late-life planning. In addition to supporting the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical data collection and analysis, this research yields valuable information for government officials, elder law practitioners, caretakers, social workers, gerontologists, and fellow researchers to understand how aging experiences are intertwined with financial and legal networks. The findings of this research will help stakeholders and officials understand how elders develop strategies to build more affordable, inclusive, and equitable care for older adults. By disseminating findings from this project in non-academic venues, this research will facilitate public understanding of the meaning of late-life well-being and challenges faced by expanding aging population globally. \r\n\r\nThe researcher asks what impacts cohort sociopolitical experiences have on older adults\u2019 perception and engagement with legal and financial institutions, and what kind of understandings of institutional power and late-life well-being emerge as elders interact with official and non-official legal and financial settings. The research methods consist of participant observation, semi-structured interviews, life histories, and archival research. Ethnographically, the researcher will observe how distinct cohorts of elders make late-life property arrangements and health-relevant decisions at various sites including notary offices, financial consultancy, will registration centers, and retirement residences. This project not only sheds light on the multifaceted nature of the relationship between social, financial, and legal sectors that shape perceptions of late-life care but also reveals the assumptions and beliefs about older adults ingrained within the legal, financial, and kinship networks. Moreover, it generates a novel understanding of how elders reconfigure and co-construct legal and financial settings through their daily practices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The study aims to understand how cohort-specific experiences shape the interactions of the elderly with both public and private legal and financial institutions. Through extensive fieldwork conducted over the span of one year in a variety of legal and financial environments, the research has critically examined the intergenerational dynamics at play in the planning for late-life and end-of-life care. The co-PI has performed a thorough analysis of the discourse related to concepts of aging and dying well within these contexts. Findings indicate that the elderly's approach to engaging with legal frameworks is significantly shaped by historical memories, particularly those of socialist regimes, which have imbued public institutions with a sense of greater trustworthiness and reliability in comparison to private consultancies. Life-history interviews with participants suggest a pattern among the elderly of seeking additional legal and financial arrangements beyond what is provided by the state, aiming to decrease dependency on family support. Additionally, the study has revealed that the intricate bureaucracies inherent in legal institutions constitute significant barriers, hindering the elderly's effective engagement with legal tools and the advancement of their legal knowledge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/12/2024<br>\nModified by: Fei&nbsp;Yuan</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
