 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE). The proposed REU site brings together an interdisciplinary research team at the University of Arkansas (UA) and criminology/criminal justice practitioners throughout the nation to provide students opportunities to learn innovative crime analysis approaches for studying some of today\u2019s most pressing social problems. The REU site is designed to provide an in-depth research experience for students who have an interest in crime analytics broadly, as well as for students who have more specific interests in issues of: 1) terrorism, violent extremism, and hate crime and 2) community and crime. Crime and justice stories account for a significant proportion of media attention, while criminal justice and homeland security remain prominent concerns for policy development at local, regional, and national levels. The REU site integrates external agencies, organizations, and corporations along with external faculty members to provide a well-rounded research experience focused on data-to-practice.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to train students to problem solve, develop a research plan, conduct basic analyses of data, and communicate research findings to diverse audiences. In doing so, the project teams will produce research findings with the potential to impact justice policy, develop crime prevention strategies, and create safer communities. This will be achieved by: 1) engaging and mentoring diverse and underrepresented undergraduate students, 2) educating and training undergraduate students on current research best practices, 3) illustrating connections between academic and practitioner work in crime analytics, and 4) building skills and social networks among undergraduate students for graduate school and professional success. We are training social scientists broadly, while highlighting the importance of research and crime analytics for diverse groups in criminal justice and criminology programs. The knowledge and skills gained during the REU are transferable to the student\u2019s home institution, graduate school, community, and workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
