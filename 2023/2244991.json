 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on the development of a vertebral augmentation system that actively prevents cement leakage during operations and utilizes photoactivation to control cement curing and enhance adhesion properties for spine applications. It utilizes ultraviolet curing technology to control cement hardening which enhances adhesion properties for spine applications. This system will combine principles from the field of dentistry that have shown advantageous properties for cement compositions and controlled curing capabilities facilitated by light administration. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project seeks the development of technology to improve the treatment of vertebral compression fractures. The technology represents the first bone cement treatment to prevent intraoperative bone cement leakage during minimally invasive percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures. Bone cement has various applications outside the field of vertebral augmentation, including growing hip and knee arthroplasty and reconstructive orthognathic procedures. The proposed technology will be used for hip and knee arthroplasty procedures. In addition, this technology may be applicable to the field of craniofacial reconstruction providing new methods and approaches for the industry. This technology is adapted with monomers and components that have been utilized successfully in dental implant surgery or independently validated. The combined technology may establish a novel treatment approach that reduces the incidence of cement leakage and secondary fractures at adjacent levels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
