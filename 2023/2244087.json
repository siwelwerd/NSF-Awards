 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, will support the training of 10 students for nine weeks during the summers of 2023-25. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students from Historically Excluded Communities (HEC) and institutions with limited research opportunities will be trained in the program. This program aims to provide undergraduates with hypothesis-based projects that investigate mechanisms of evolution and promote careers in science. The capstone of the nine-week experience is a public poster presentation at the Summer Research Symposium. Assessment of the program will be done through the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be required to register in the NSF ETAP system (etap.nsf.gov) and tracked after the program to determine their career paths. \r\n\r\nThe REU Site: Mechanisms of Evolution (MOE) project invites undergraduates to participate in research investigating evolutionary change in prokaryotic and eukaryotic models. Mentors are faculty members in the UNLV School of Life Sciences and the Department of Geosciences. MOE takes a holistic approach to training undergraduates, and the co-curricular program integrates three modules: Becoming a Scientist, Science Communication, and STEM Careers. Becoming a Scientist asks the participants to formulate hypotheses, analyze data, read primary literature, and complete Responsible Conduct in Research training. The Science Communication module includes presenting at REU group meetings and composing a research abstract. The STEM Careers module leverages the workshops offered by the UNLV Office of Undergraduate Research and presentations by former REU participants and current graduate students. REU participants and their mentors will initiate an Individual Development Plan to identify short- and long-term goals. Applications will be accepted through the NSF ETAP website from January 1 to the first Friday in March. The PI, co-PI, and the Program Coordinator will score the applications by ranking the applicant\u2019s stated interest in 1) either a STEM career or graduate program, 2) the availability of research opportunities at the home institution, and 3) the letter of recommendation. All REU participants must be US citizens or permanent residents. More information about the program is available by visiting https://www.unlv.edu/lifesciences/moereu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Regner, kurt.regner@unlv.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Robleto, eduardo.robleto@unlv.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
