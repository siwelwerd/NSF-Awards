 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create a tool that can be used by untrained users and without sophisticated equipment to allow diagnosis of medical conditions characterized by the combination of multiple indicator molecules. While some medical conditions can be diagnosed by the level of just a single molecule, most require the measurement of multiple molecules\u2019 levels to enable accurate diagnosis. To address this challenge in a user-friendly manner, this project entails creating a tool that harnesses biology to sense target molecules, combine the information gained from those measurements, and report out patient status to the user. The project uses technology that allows genes to be turned on and off in small droplets that mimic simplified versions of cells. Individual droplets sense an individual molecule and then communicate with another droplet that produces a combined readout. By having each droplet detect a single molecule and exploit a reusable form of communication with other droplets, it makes the tool modular for creation of diagnostics for essentially any set of target molecules. The droplet technology and the combination of proposed approaches for communication and combination of signals are unique and novel. If successfully completed, this project would impact society broadly and help address health and other inequities by enabling assessment and monitoring of nutrition status in developing countries and around the world, helping individuals and improving public health policy.\r\n\r\nAs a proof of principle testbed, the project focuses on the development of a comprehensive diagnostic for zinc deficiency, a condition that is responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of children under the age of 5 every year. The droplet technology uses aqueous two-phase systems combined with cell-free transcription and translation to create \u201cprotocells\u201d that enable the implementation of biological circuits for sensing and signal integration and thus the creation of complex biosensors. Multiple protocells each produce a distinct messenger molecule drawn from nature to enable communication with a separate \u201creceiver\u201d protocell that integrates the signal via a three-hybrid system. By using a common communication and integration framework, individual sensor protocells can be changed to sense different target molecules without impacting the downstream biological computation, which greatly simplifies the creation of new diagnostics for different conditions. An important part of the project will also include efforts to make the protocell platform more efficient and robust for field use. These efforts use the Rules of Life for Building a Synthetic Cell and for Microbiome Interactions and Mechanisms as the basis for the development of a platform that could have a substantial impact on nutritional epidemiology and patient health by virtue of easier access to medical diagnostics. The project also envisions and will entail pursuit of environmental applications of the proposed platform. These efforts, combined with outreach efforts and support for students from groups that are underrepresented in engineering, are expected to have a truly broad impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
