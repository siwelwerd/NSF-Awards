Currently in its fifteenth iteration, ICCP is the premier annual conference dedicated to computational photography and is organized with the vision of fostering a community of researchers that all converge to this field from traditionally distinct disciplines, including: imaging and optics, imaging and signal processing, vision and graphics, sensors, and electronics. The ICCP 2023 program includes keynote and invited talks from the above-mentioned and other communities, paper presentations, poster and demo sessions, and networking events. This program creates rich opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas across research and application areas and provides both junior and senior researchers with an environment where they can engage in brainstorming and mentoring discourse.\r\n\r\nThis award facilitates the participation in ICCP 2023 of a diverse group of students, including: students from underrepresented groups; students from research labs that traditionally do not attend ICCP but work on closely related problems; and students that would not otherwise have the resources to attend. The award provides travel grants for 10 selected US-based students. Applications are solicited broadly from across the US, and recipients of travel grants are selected by the ICCP 2023 program chairs. Each travel grant partially covers travel and lodging costs with a conference registration waiver. Recipient students are invited to attend all aspects all elements of the ICCP 2023 program (paper presentations, keynote talks, invited talks, poster and demo sessions, reception, breaks and networking events); present their research work as a poster at the ICCP 2023 poster sessions; and participate in an industry consortium connecting them to senior industry mentors for research and career development advice. Overall, the project will support the career development of some of the brightest junior researchers in computational photography and will increase diversity and student participation in ICCP 2023, and the broader computational photography community. In turn, this will help increase the number of active researchers and educators in STEM, advance the computational photography field, and accelerate the research and development of technologies with broad beneficial societal impacts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
