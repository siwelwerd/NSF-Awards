 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to develop a novel cement material that has higher performance and lower environmental impact than conventional materials made from ordinary Portland cement. Cement manufacturing produces 8% of total global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Hence, there is a need to find alternative chemistries for this vital building material to reduce gas emissions. This project has three goals, the first one involves determining how to produce these novel formulations in large scale and in a factory instead of on laboratory benches. The second goal relates to the understanding of how feedstock availability and manufacturing capacity can meet market demands for commercialization. Finally, the third goal will allow the understanding of the safety of the new materials. These research, scalability and implementation questions will be answered in collaboration with an industrial partner, which is one of the leading makers of concrete block in the United States. In addition to the technical and commercialization benefits, this project will also train students to become leaders and entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project seeks to develop a minimum viable product consisting of a low-carbon high-performance concrete block. The materials will resemble ancient Roman cements in chemical composition but with a much higher carbon uptake potential. Collaborative research with a corporate partner will enable the refinement of material formulations and curing processes for manufacturability. Specifically, this project will examine the use of blended cements to improve CO2 permeability, use of sodium bicarbonate salts to cure from within, and harness the role of trace metals additives in the slag to enhance the strength of the material. A quantitative sustainable design model will be developed and used to identify important parameters for the selection of the materials to reduce carbon emissions. The ultimate goal of the project is to make a concrete block prototype with a compressive strength of 15 MPa and a carbon uptake (net negative) potential of 1 kg CO2 per cement block for under $5. The current conventional concrete block has a compressive strength of 12 MPa and carbon emissions (net positive) of 5 kg CO2 per cement block for around $2. It is expected, upon successful completion of the project, that the new material will have a superior performance compared to the currently available materials that will offset the lower cost of the current material.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
