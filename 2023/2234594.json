 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to increase semiconductor package production yield, reliability, and cost-effectiveness by introducing an in-situ or in-line sensing mechanism with real-time production corrective actions. The detection of issues during manufacturing is enabled by mm-Wave antenna sensors that can detect hidden process defects based on embedded metal and dielectric features in real time. One of the goals of this project is to overcome key manufacturing bottlenecks in high-density wiring substrates with several component integrations for advanced packaging. Another goal is to reduce, and perhaps, eliminate waste impact and carbon footprint on the environment via intelligent Additive Manufacturing. The proposed manufacturing path will generate new manufacturing tool business opportunities across the electronics supply chain. Upon successful completion of the project, the new sensing technology will be licensed. The project will also provide an ideal opportunity to prepare the next-generation workforce with strong technical and communication skills as well as experience in manufacturing challenges and market trends. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop a unique, noncontact, real-time detection system for hidden manufacturing defects in electronics with the goal of achieving in-line process control for reproducibility, tolerance and yield, eventually leading to high-density electronics integration. This technology will be achieved through an innovative mm-Wave antenna array sensing system to reveal hidden metal-dielectric features through backscattering. Detection of spectra and amplitude shifts will be classified or mapped into defect categories through machine learning algorithms for real-time corrective actions. The advancement of antennas with smaller Radar Cross-Sections (RCS) has allowed the design of mm-Wave sensors with a broad impact in several areas, including 6G communications, healthcare, safety, and security products. In this PFI-TT project, the mm-Wave noncontact probing system will be integrated into production-scale 3D printing systems to achieve defect-free manufacturing by collaborating with a technology partner. The proposed mm-Wave sensing brings precision impedance-matched Radio Frequency (RF) interconnects and antennas, all coupled with advances in wiring design for active embedding. Further, continuous remote in-line monitoring for scalable high-volume manufacturing can lead to solutions for the self-healing of manufacturing defects. Overall, this new technology may have a pervasive role in future heterogeneous system manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
