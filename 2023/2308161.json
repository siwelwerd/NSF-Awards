 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since their formation in the early universe, galaxies have been converting their gas reservoirs - almost entirely composed of atomic (HI) and molecular hydrogen (H2) - into stars. Astronomers have formed an impressively detailed picture of this process, including the \"hydrogen cycle\" by which atomic and molecular gas transition from one form to the other and back again. The study of H2 in extremely distant (z > 3) galaxies has been revolutionized by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), which takes advantage of highly luminous \"tracer\" molecules like carbon monoxide (CO). To probe the HI content of galaxies astronomers must rely on the much weaker 21 cm \"spin-flip\" transition of HI, which has effectively restricted studies to the local (z < 0.2) universe. This project's goal is to extend this HI census in galaxies to the unprecedented redshift of z = 1.45 and fill a crucial gap in our current understanding of HI\u2019s role in galaxy evolution through the Looking At the Distant Universe with the MeerKAT Array (LADUMA) survey. The project, jointly led by the PI, has been awarded 3,424-hours of high-priority time with the 64-element MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa to image a single ultra-deep pointing in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South. Supporting observations will be used to allow HI \"stacking\" observations as well as discriminating HI from OH megamaser emission. All survey data will be publicly released. This project will allow continued U.S. leadership in Square Kilometer Array (SKA) precursor science. The award will also support the training of a graduate student in cutting-edge science as well as a new outreach program to community colleges in New Jersey. \r\n\r\nResults will be derived from both direct HI spectral line detections and by \u201cstacking\u201d samples of galaxies with previously measured positions and redshifts. The latter will allow LADUMA to achieve its full potential for studying HI out to z = 1.45, at least in a statistical sense. The project also encompasses the identification of OH megamaser \u201cinterlopers\u201d in the HI sample that will be used to trace the cosmic history of gas-rich mergers out to z = 1.86. These research activities will benefit from detailed comparisons to theoretical models and are well-matched to the \u201ccosmic ecosystems\u201d theme of the recently released Astro2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics, including that theme\u2019s priority science area (\u201cunveiling the hidden drivers of galaxy growth\u201d), a science question (\u201cHow do gas, metals, and dust flow into and out of galaxies?\u201d), as well as a critical discovery area prioritized for galaxy evolution research (\u201cmapping the circumgalactic medium and the intergalactic medium in emission\u201d).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
