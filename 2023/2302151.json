 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of technology to detect airborne pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, in near real-time and on-site. Timely actions informed by early detection can reduce the spread of infection in a number of settings, such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes, and office buildings, thereby also reducing the costs of healthcare, absenteeism, and loss of productivity. The coronavirus pandemic is an obvious current target for early detection, given the severe consequences of infections among vulnerable populations and the continuous disruption to jobs and children\u2019s education. However, many other airborne pathogens are of interest in similar settings, including common viruses such as the flu, and more rare viruses with severe consequences, such as tuberculosis and varicella. Timely actions that could be taken to reduce the spread of infection include isolation of exposed individuals, use of protective equipment, control of in-room ventilation, and space decontamination. More generally, occupants of spaces may be made aware through a phone app of the pathogen levels detected in areas of interest, so they can make informed decisions about what areas to visit and if masking may be advisable.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of an integrated, automated, and portable device for sensing airborne pathogens on-site and in almost real-time. The process proposed consists of an initial collection step, in which virus particles are collected through electrostatic precipitation. Then, there is a detachment and RNA extraction step, followed by an enrichment phase. This technology is realized with a novel method that leverages the natural negative charge of RNA. Finally, the final steps are the chemical detection step and the classification step. The core innovation is not only the integration of the overall process described above, but also, the creation of a fieldable process that obtains highly concentrated target RNA from in-air viral particles. Pathogen detection from the air is substantially more challenging than detection from a patient swab due to the much lower in-air concentrations, those these concentrations can still infect people. The enrichment step is critical to be able to detect relevant in-air pathogen concentrations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
