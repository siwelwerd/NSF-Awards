 "awd_abstract_narration": "The iron oxide minerals present in geological materials such as rocks, soils, and sediment vary greatly, and their structure, chemical makeup, and magnetic properties reflect the environmental conditions in which these minerals were formed. In this research, faculty and undergraduate researchers work in collaboration to investigate the magnetic properties of laboratory-prepared iron oxides similar to geological materials. The undergraduate students involved in the projects will participate in experimental work of data collection and data analysis. The proposed study will engage undergraduate students in original research where they will be trained on how to solve problems, and thus further the mission of training the next generation of scientists using modern technology and techniques.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this Research in Undergraduate Institution (RUI) project is to investigate the physical and chemical parameters such as time, temperature, and the availability of ions that influence iron oxide formation. The researchers will investigate the competitive process of iron substitutions, Al + Ni and Al + Cr, in the lattice of goethite and the conversion process of gamma-beta-epsilon-alpha Fe2O3 polymorphs.  By using a combination of techniques, M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy at room temperature, and magnetometry from 50 K to 1000 K in an externally applied field up to 3 T, they will investigate the magnetic properties of the iron phases, resulting in valuable information when studying soils, sediments, and archaeological materials.  Undergraduate students will be engaged in this research work during the summer and/or regular school year, trained to use modern instruments and techniques to investigate magnetic materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
