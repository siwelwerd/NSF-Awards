 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for trainees, as well as faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), to attend the 19th International Xenopus Conference in August 2023.  Held biennially, this conference is the primary meeting for researchers using the African Clawed Frogs (Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis). Researchers use these animals to investigate and make new scientific discoveries in all aspects of biology, including, but not limited to, regulation of cell division, embryonic development, cell movement and communication, and the control of gene expression.  The animals also offer opportunities to study the biological processes underlying many human congenital diseases, cancers, and neurodevelopmental disorders.  The Xenopus conference permits researchers from the USA, Canada, UK, Europe, Asia, and Latin America to share new findings, learn new techniques, and develop collaborative projects.  This meeting is especially important for trainees, including graduate students and postdoctoral research associates, as well as new independent researchers and faculty from PUIs.  Researchers and trainees will also learn about the services, resources, and collaborative opportunities offered by the Xenopus Resource Centers.  The proposal requests support for travel awards for 30 domestic trainees and 9 faculty from PUIs within the USA, which would reduce financial barriers to their participation in the conference.  This support will facilitate the exchange of new findings in many scientific fields, advance the scientific and professional development of numerous trainees, and help to integrate current understanding in these areas for undergraduate instruction; moreover, it strengthens the use of Xenopus for fundamental research.\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests support for trainees and faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) to attend the 19th International Xenopus Conference in August 2023.  Held biennially, this conference is the primary meeting for investigators using African Clawed Frogs (Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis).  It offers a forum for integration of new findings across a broad spectrum of cell and developmental biology.  Featured topics will include cellular scaling, cytoskeletal dynamics, cell cycle, the mechanobiology of cell movement, ciliary biogenesis and function, genome organization, epigenetics of early development, cell fate specification and translational control, along with topics in regeneration, organogenesis, immunology, and neural development and function.  Additional talks will address the use of Xenopus as a model for congenital disease, cancers, neurodevelopmental disorders, and neural injury.  The meeting will feature presentations on the resources, services, and collaborative opportunities provided by the International Xenopus Resource Centers in the USA, UK, and Japan.  There will also be sessions dedicated to mentoring for multiple career stages, professional development, and emerging publication practices. This proposal requests support for travel awards for 30 domestic trainees and 9 faculty from PUIs within the USA, which would reduce their financial barriers to participation in the conference.  This support will facilitate the exchange of new findings in cell biology, developmental biology, molecular genetics, and neuroscience, advance the scientific and professional development of numerous trainees, and help to integrate these new findings in undergraduate curriculum; moreover, it strengthens and sustains the use of Xenopus as a model system for fundamental research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
