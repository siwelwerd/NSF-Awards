 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator, Dr. Myriam Telus of the University of California-Santa Cruz, has developed experiments to measure gases released when meteorites are heated to the high temperatures occurring during planet formation. These experiments are used to understand the link between the interior and atmospheres of rocky planets. This work also provides hands-on research experience for students at both the undergraduate and graduate level. There is still much that is not understand about atmospheres, the layer of gases surrounding planets. Rocky planets, like the Earth, may form atmospheres during the early stages of their formation. Planet atmospheres form when gas is released from the planet due to heating within its interior. Meteorites are left over rocky material from the early stages of planet formation. They provide a unique way to link the initial makeup of atmospheres to the ingredients that went into building planets. This connection is important because planets are not easily observed by telescopes; the main window into other worlds is through their atmospheres. \r\n\r\nThe investigator will determine the composition of meteorite outgassing species, especially those relevant for exoplanet observations such as H2O, CO, CO2, and CH4. The objectives are to 1) use a thermogravimetric analyzer combined with a small gas chromatograph system to measure the outgassing of gas species for various meteorite types at temperatures up to 1600\u00b0C and under various redox conditions and 2) use complementary geochemical techniques to track changes in the bulk composition and mineralogy of outgassing residues. These experiments are relevant for rocky planets, including those around Sun-like stars, those that formed in more oxidizing conditions, hot rocky planets, and those that experience open-system conditions. This research can provide foundational data for observing, modeling, and interpreting atmospheric signatures of exoplanets. The experimental approach of this investigator is an important shift from model-based methods typically used to address this connection.\r\n\r\nCo-funding was provided by the Division of Astronomy and Division of Earth Sciences through a partnership focused on Geoscience Lessons for and from Other Worlds (GLOW).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
