 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wyoming is home to the Wind River Reservation, where both the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho people live. Alongside the urgent need to increase access to computer science education for their students, the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho people place a high priority on teaching and preserving their cultural traditions, reflecting both strong community values and a response to historical injustices. In response to these district priorities and interests, three school districts with elementary schools on the Wind River reservation have formed a research-practice partnership with the American Institutes for Research, Wyoming Department of Education, BootUp Professional Development, and Partner to Improve, called the Wind River Elementary Computer Science Collaborative. This project builds on prior research in which the project team developed elementary computer science projects and lessons that integrated history, language, and culture of the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho; provided professional development for elementary teachers and paraeducators; and studied implementation of elementary computer science projects. With buy-in and support from school, district, and tribal leaders, the Collaborative will promote the sustainability of elementary computer science and develop resources to support other districts in adopting successful processes for teaching Indigenous studies through computer science.\r\n\r\nThe project will directly serve three Indigenous student-serving elementary schools, 18 teachers per year, six administrators, up to 18 high school student mentors, and 400+ elementary students. The proposed activities are (a) to expand the Collaborative to include more elementary teachers and incorporate high school, near-peer mentors; (b) to support forms of teacher collaboration that have been critical in the Collaborative's work to date; (c) to further engage the Wind River community through ongoing communication to tribal and school leadership and family engagement events; and (d) to conduct research. Specifically, the research will investigate how teaching Indigenous studies through computer science relates to and expands an existing framework for culturally responsive-sustaining computer science pedagogy and to assess whether and why teachers participating in the collaborative show increased self-efficacy for teaching computer science and whether and why students experiencing Indigenous studies instruction through computer science develop computer science identities that feel compatible with their Indigenous heritages. This project aims to produce generalizable knowledge about models of professional development and implementation at the intersection of Indigenous studies and computer science education. These models will enrich the field's understanding of how frameworks for integrated instruction can be applied to increase the cultural relevance of computer science education for Indigenous students, and the results inform future research-based approaches to increasing the cultural relevance of computer science education for other groups traditionally underrepresented in computer science. The project advance knowledge about how teaching Indigenous studies through computer science can support positive identity development for elementary students and high school mentors. This award is supported by the Computer Science for All: Research and RPPs program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
