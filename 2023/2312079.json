This GRC will showcase advances and challenges in the development, modeling, characterization, and commercialization of nanoscale materials for energy conversion and storage, bringing together a diverse array of scientists in this field, including senior scientists, early career scientists, and postdocs/students. Understanding and controlling the nanoscale structure and properties of materials is increasingly important for enabling maximal performance in energy devices. This meeting will take an in-depth look at energy and fuel generation (photovoltaics, catalysis, solar fuels) and energy storage and conversion (batteries and supercapacitors), with specific focus on advanced functionalities enabled by control over the nanoscale structure and properties of materials. The meeting will foster interactions among scientists from different energy disciplines and at different stages in their careers, with a focus on diversifying participation from underrepresented groups in STEM. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, registration fee support will be provided to early-career participants, including students, postdoctoral associates, and junior faculty/researchers.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary\r\n\r\nThe specific goals of the proposed conference are to (1) increase domestic graduate student and postdoc participation, especially those from underrepresented groups in STEM; (2) place emphasis on the latest understanding of novel energy materials; and (3) foster intellectually stimulating discussion and ideas amongst participants of all career stages and backgrounds. The field of nanomaterials for applications in energy technology is an area of national priority, and this conference will provide opportunities to discuss various topics including the interaction of materials with light, synthesis of nanoscale materials for energy, materials chemistry for energy storage, and (photo)catalysis. In addition to application-specific sessions, cross-cutting sessions will include modeling, data analytics, and machine learning for energy materials. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, the GRC will gather leading experts in the major and emerging areas in nanomaterials and energy materials research.  The associated Gordon Research Seminar will provide a forum for graduate students, postdocs and other early career scientists to engage in meaningful research discussion and networking.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
