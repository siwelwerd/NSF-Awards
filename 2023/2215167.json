 "awd_abstract_narration": "The state of Americans\u2019 STEM knowledge and competency is disappointingly low. \u201cThe Nation\u2019s Report Card\u201d reveals that the average scores of all tested students, in all science content areas, fall below proficiency levels (NAEP 2016). Countless programs aim to redress these deficiencies and prepare Americans, especially youth, for global competitiveness. However, few intentionally call out the importance of creativity in scientific investigation. Scientific creativity is a non-linear, divergent thinking process that explores many possible solutions to a problem or issue, as opposed to a convergent thinking process that follows a particular set of logical steps to arrive at one solution or one correct answer. Creativity is characterized by the ability to question phenomena and to imagine solutions, often by thinking outside the box. Scientific creativity is especially important in astrophysics, where it\u2019s frequently impractical or even impossible to test one\u2019s theories in the real world. In these cases, scientists rely on thought experiments, which allow them to hypothesize and visualize the logical progressions and ultimate outcomes of various scenarios, using only the \u201clab\u201d in their head. This Project addresses the need to provide models of scientific creativity by highlighting the work of Einstein and contemporary astrophysicists using thought experiments to test ideas and imagine outcomes in their minds. It will leverage the large public interest in the back to back annular (2023) and total solar (2024 eclipse) with learning opportunities and resources that include 1) a 3D giant screen, dome, and planetarium film featuring the groundbreaking discoveries of Albert Einstein and contemporary astrophysicists Drs. Andrea Ghez and Nergis Mavalvala; 2) a collection of learning activities that connect to the themes of the film and prepare learners for the solar events; 3) a strategic engagement program for girls that will build the capacity of informal educators to lead young women in exploration of space science; 4) a citizen science capstone project which will engage young women in collecting data and contributing to our understanding of the workings of the universe, in collaboration with the Dynamic Eclipse Broadcast (DEB) Initiative. Project partners include Cosmic Pictures, the St. Louis Science Center, the University of Southern Illinois-Carbondale STEM and Education Research Center, and the National Girls Collaborative Project. \r\n\r\nAn evaluative-research agenda conducted by Rockman et al, will inform development of the project\u2019s components, measure outcomes and impacts, and further knowledge for the informal science education field to advance gender equity in informal STEM learning. Formative studies will assess appeal of the film and engagement activities during development phases to provide feedback and make improvements. The studies will include measures related to increased comprehension of specific science concepts such as gravity, black holes, and gravitational waves. Studies will also measure impacts of the activities, such as recognizing of the contribution women have made to STEM pursuits. A comprehensive summative evaluation will study the impacts of project deliverables on giant screen film viewers, girl-group leaders, and engagement program participants, building knowledge for the informal STEM field about best practices for learning about space science and encouraging scientific pursuits. A connected research study utilizing novel data collection techniques will yield new information about how to encourage gender equity. Research questions include: 1) How does participation in the engagement program that emphasizes scientific curiosity, exposure to matched-gender role models, and participation in a citizen science project influence middle school girls\u2019 empowerment to investigate space science and sense of belonging in a scientific community? 2) How do interactions with matched-gender adult scientists, near peers, and girl group leaders mediate girls\u2019 experiences? Researchers will use a mix of quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques appropriate for the data collected to document how, for whom, and under what conditions the project facilitates curiosity, empowerment, and a sense of belonging. \r\n\r\nThis Innovations in Development project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to (a) advance new approaches to and evidence-based understanding of the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments; (b) provide multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences; (c) advance innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments; and (d) engage the public of all ages in learning STEM in informal environments. \r\nCo-funding was provided by the LIGO Research Support program that funds the detection of gravitational waves in the U. S.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
