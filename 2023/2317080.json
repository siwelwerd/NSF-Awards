 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is funding to support seven promising doctoral students from the United States as part of a total cohort of 20 graduate students, along with seven distinguished researchers from both academia and industry, to participate in a 1.5-day Doctoral Consortium at the 2023 ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2023). The Consortium will be organized in two versions: a virtual-only version to be held April 17-18 and an in-person-only version to be held on April 25-26.  The annual CHI conference, sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery\u2019s Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (ACM SIGCHI), has for years been the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and practice related to human-computer interaction.  CHI 2023 will take place April 23-28 in Hamburg, Germany, and the theme of this year's conference is \"reCHInnecting\". The doctoral consortium has taken place annually at the CHI conference since 1986 and has helped launch the careers of many outstanding HCI researchers. Following 2022\u2019s lead, this year there will be both a virtual-only version (for participants not at the in-person event) and an in-person event (for participants not at the virtual event).  The CHI Doctoral Consortium is a research-focused workshop in which career guidance to a group of selected highly promising PhD students is provided by peers and distinguished senior researchers. The consortium has taken place annually at the CHI conference since 1986, and has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding HCI researchers. The event is always held at the annual CHI conference. \r\n\r\nThe 2023 Doctoral Consortium will continue to influence and improve the quality of Ph.D. research in the field of HCI by building a cohort group of new researchers and providing guidance from senior members of the field.  Students selected to attend the CHI Doctoral Consortium will have a chance to discuss their dissertation research with a panel of distinguished researchers from academia and industry; they will also have the opportunity to participate in the CHI 2023 conference and to interact with some of the best as well as emerging scholars in the CHI field.  Participation in the conference will illustrate to attendees the diversity and interrelationship of HCI research.  The CHI 2023 Doctoral Consortium will adopt the successful schedule implemented in CHI 2018, 2019 and 2022. To build a cohort of future scholars and provide high-quality feedback to students, the workshop has traditionally consisted of two days of student presentations followed by feedback from a panel of experts. During two special sessions, student participants will be present at their posters at certain times to discuss their work with interested attendees. The posters will also be available for viewing during the entire technical program. The work of these consortium participants is thus showcased to the entire CHI conference, and the students have an opportunity to receive feedback from a large audience.  In addition, an extended abstract of each participant\u2019s dissertation research will be published in the CHI 2023 Extended Abstracts, which is distributed to all conference registrants and included in the ACM Digital Library, allowing the students participants\u2019 work to be shared with a far larger audience than the CHI conference attendee\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
