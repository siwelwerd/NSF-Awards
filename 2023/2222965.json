 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of technology that unlocks the use of abundantly available geothermal hot dry rock energy for reliable renewable energy. This technology will be economically feasible and provide an optional zero emission cogeneration configuration for harnessing cooling loop waste heat from zero emissions thermal electric power plants. The additional benefits, broader impacts, and market opportunity for cogeneration applications create an increase in power generation efficiency and capacity.  Increases in net zero emissions power will also be available at utility scale. This technology will reduce water use during wet cooling in power plants by replacing the iconic supplemental cooling towers for thermal electric power plants worldwide with cogeneration. Some larger and long-term societal impacts of this research include: a more stable power grid due to reliable geothermal renewable energy generation and a cleaner environment especially for populations living close to traditional power plants and industrial infrastructure. Global technology licensing applications include: grid flexing and resiliency, water desalination/filtration, green hydrogen production, and national security.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop software that uses computation, measurement, observations, and computer models, based on sound theory to find operational boundaries, validate key performance metrics, and optimize functional parameters for more efficient power production. This research includes the examination of critical technology functions and elements that determine peak operational efficiencies. The goal of this research will be to produce analytical computer models to look specifically at: 1) air intake velocity for a given set of pressure differentials, 2) air intake impedance, 3) thermal/pressure gradients generated by heat exchange activity, 4) air flow impedance generated by heat exchangers, and 5) expected exhaust air flow given idealized intake, heat exchange configurations, and designs. Anticipated results will provide quantifiable and measurable data tables including system sizing, energy input requirements, and mechanical and organic inlet air flow with emphasis on modeling of data analysis and determining specific energy inputs and power outputs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The major goal of this investigation was to validate the technical viability of the Modified Updraft Tower concept, using scientific methods, well-reasoned and well-organized activities including computation, measurement, observations, and analyzation of computer models, based on sound theory, to find operational boundaries, and optimum functional parameters. The primary outcome was the computation modeled simulations of coherent, displaced air with sufficient velocity and mass flow rate, induced by a specific thermal energy input and MUT geometrical configurations, to demonstrate critical functions and elements that determine an operational range and operational envelope of the MUT. The specific goal of this funded research was the production and analysis of computer-based simulation models, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Air intake velocity for a given set of pressure differentials.</li>\n<li>Thermal/Pressure gradient disruption.</li>\n<li>Expected exhaust air flow generated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, goals of market research and broader impacts substantiation which involved completing the Beat the Odds Boot Camp and Customer Discovery helped define the MUT commercialization potential, identification of specific initial customers, innovative products and services derived from MUT technology including development partners, market growth possibilities, and the processes needed to build lasting sustainable societal and economic impact.</p>\n<p>The NSF Grant (2222965) was awarded in 2023 to PowerSILO Inc., and was supported by two outside consulting firms, FEAmax Engineering Service LLC of North Carolina and CZero Inc. of Colorado, with both firms unknowingly participating in a single blind CFD modeling, simulation, and investigation effort. PowerSILO&rsquo;s initial work focused on demonstrating that harnessing Rankine Cycle process waste heat (or RE Geothermal) to create a buoyancy driven air flow generated in a vertical tower configuration is viable for extracting the resulting kinetic energy as electricity with the use of a novel Vertical Axis Vertical Airflow Nozzled Turbine (VAVANT) design. Though unanimous, positive concurrence from both firms regarding &ldquo;the viability&rdquo; to the geometry investigated was not achieved; both teams did produce independent CFD models and simulation data that substantiate significant induced airflow and MUT power output potential. This phase of investigation was expected to provide neither a highly refined, efficient, or complete product, but only to serve as validation of the concept and proof of the physics supporting said concept. &nbsp;A result of this exploration is that the PowerSILO team pivoted from an internal heat exchange arrangement to a forced air configuration.&nbsp; The results of this investigation led by PowerSILO validates this basic concept of a Modified Updraft Tower as functional and that further investigation is needed to refine the precise operating envelopes, required energy inputs, specific configurations, material selection, and construction methodologies to fully determine the commercial viability of any products or services developed from this technology. PowerSILO&rsquo;s investigation conducted 14 CFD simulations of digital models that included baseline cases, ground towers, and forced air simulations. Of the 10 Forced Air CFD simulations conducted, 6 have configurations that demonstrate and document an average VAVANT turbine velocity of 14.7meters/s, with a highest measured velocity of 28.5meters/s through the @19.5meter diameter VAVANT Turbine.
