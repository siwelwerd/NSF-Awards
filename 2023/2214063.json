 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project to address a technological innovation in energy storage. Energy storage is a critical technology for the energy utility industries offering more reliable and affordable energy supply, a cleaner environment, and stronger energy infrastructure. Specific advantages of energy storage include a robust energy supply during storms and other natural disasters, aiding response and recovery efforts. This technology may also keep power plants and the grid functioning in times of physical and cyber-security threats. The project enables excellent grid stability and power plant flexibility to accommodate the growth of various renewable energy technologies and the expansion of electrified transportation systems.  \r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase 1 project proposes to address a technological innovation in energy storage. The reduced Levelized Electricity Cost due to this storage can directly benefit the end-users and broader population in the US and across the globe.  Notably, existing mechanical storage technologies have many attractive features such as short to mid-load response, black start, robust, long life, safety, and efficiency, but these technologies are not good at meeting scalability, reliability, and compactness metrics. On the other hand, chemical storage has mid-load response, long-lifetime, and scalability, but is inadequate with regard to safety, short-load response, black start, and efficiency. The proposed solution allows energy companies to explore low-cost technologies that can offer better performance and can be easily integrated with existing fossil power plants. The primary innovation combines mechanical and chemical storage technologies so that the resultant technology adapts the best features to provide enhanced performance at a cheaper capital, operational, and maintenance cost. The hybrid mechanical and chemical system proposed here uses supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) as the mechanical storage component, while chemical storage is achieved using natural gas or hydrogen. This proposed technology is referred to as an integrated chemical and sCO2 energy storage (ICsCO2ES).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
