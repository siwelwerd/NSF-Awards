 "awd_abstract_narration": "The institutional cohort postdoctoral fellowship program for Community Engaged Disciplinary and Educational Researchers in STEM (CEDERS) is designed to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctoral graduates in STEM Education. Community outreach and public dissemination are regular features of the work that STEM researchers do. However, traditional approaches to university-community partnerships privilege academic expertise. In contrast, community engaged scholarship (CES) encourages a more democratic process and exchange of multiple types of expertise. This approach can welcome engagement among communities who often have more knowledge of social issues than academic researchers. Consequently, CES in STEM holds promise to broaden participation in STEM-related fields. The CEDERS program is designed to prioritize CES in educational research projects led by postdoctoral fellows and done in collaboration with STEM researchers and community stakeholders. Findings from the fellows\u2019 projects have the potential to influence the direction of STEM outreach and education that will reach a large number of community stakeholders. Hence, this project may directly improve the effectiveness of STEM outreach and education to serve the needs of communities. Further, this model for a STEM educator-STEM disciplinary researcher-community partnership can provide a pathway to CES at other institutions working towards the goal of broadening participation in STEM on an even larger scale.\r\n\r\nThe project activities will integrate the best practices of STEM postdoctoral development and CES learning to elevate training of STEM education postdoctoral fellows through (1) engagement in research that facilitates collaboration among STEM education and STEM disciplinary scholars and community partners; (2) design of research that aims for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources across institutional and community stakeholders for the purpose of broadening participation in STEM in PreK-16 contexts; and (3) access to resources and relationships, including participation in multiple groups and communities that can expand early career scholars\u2019 connectedness. Integrating across these approaches can improve not only the postdoctoral fellows\u2019 capacity for impactful research but also their preparedness for a professional career in STEM education. To reflect the collaborative nature of the project, postdoctoral fellows will be mentored by a committee of STEM education and STEM faculty and supported through individualized research and professional development plans. These plans follow effective models for building capacity for engaged scholarship along a competency-based trajectory and incorporate promising practices for faculty development.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by NSF\u2019s STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) Program with co-funding from the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) Program. The STEM Ed PRF Program aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied research that advances knowledge within the field. The AISL Program, supports projects that: (a) contribute to research and practice that considers informal STEM learning's role in equity and belonging in STEM; (b) promote personal and educational success in STEM; (c) advance public engagement in scientific discovery; (d) foster interest in STEM careers; (e) create and enhance the theoretical and empirical foundations for effective informal STEM learning; (f) improve community vibrancy; and/or (g) enhance science communication and the public's engagement in and understanding of STEM and STEM processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
