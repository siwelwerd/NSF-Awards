 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming into a versatile set of tools with far-reaching implications for individuals, society, and the economy. This workshop serves as a platform for exchanging ideas on the imperative to expand the scope of educational programs and curricula in AI. The expansion of AI education aims to bolster the capacity to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary for pursuing careers in AI while fostering diversity and inclusivity in AI education. A comprehensive approach to increasing diversity involves offering inclusive learning opportunities in AI education for learners of all ages, from kindergarten to adulthood, and developing learning materials that encompass AI knowledge, skills, ethics, and responsible utilization.\r\n\r\nThe workshop on AI education will be held at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. It aims to gather thought leaders in AI education to develop and document guidelines for AI education curricula. The workshop discussions will consider the competencies and needs of the workforce; guidelines on how to direct efforts and resources to increase the capacity for future AI professionals and a more AI literate workforce in general; guidelines on how to measure and increase capacity and diversity of people engaged in AI education. The workshop will be structured to include presentations on three main topics: educational resources, capacity to produce graduates, and measuring quality of programs. In addition to these presentations, breakout groups will be formed to brainstorm specific topics. The outcome of the workshop will be a report on discussions and recommendations. It will detail the existing educational resources, including model curricula, concept inventories, and AI education initiatives, illustrating the current landscape of AI instruction. It will document participants' insights about how to measure the capacity of institutions to produce graduates with AI-related degrees, certifications, and skills. It will outline the criteria discussed for measuring an institution's excellence in AI education, with a particular focus on their ability to attract and retain a diverse student population in STEM fields, including women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
