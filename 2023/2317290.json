 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project provides next generation ambulatory seizure data acquisition. The advent of mobile health advances during the COVID-19 health crisis have enabled new innovations to be considered. This effort provides a framework for the next line of remote neurological data acquisition capabilities for the implementation of military helmet designs that detect battlefield traumatic brain injuries, football helmet designs that detect sports-related brain injuries, caps for first responder teams that detect trauma, at-home monitoring headsets for remote migraine assessment, etc. A complete analogue front end (AFE) will be developed in order to provide digitized electroencephalograph (EEG) signals to the downstream stages. The project will have a major impact in several areas, namely, wearable bio-devices, data fusion, and neurological data extraction and visualization of complex biological systems. This device can be utilized for first responders at the scene of neurological trauma such as emergency medical technicians, battle front medical areas, and sports related events.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will provide a robust mobile device that can be worn in an at-home setting for remote neurological monitoring.  The solution will remove noisy artifacts from the electroencephalograph signal in order to perform neurological diagnoses and provide neurological reporting to the neurologist as an aid to quantify the patient\u2019s seizure instances. The analogue front end (AFE) provides the foundation for a portable electroencephalograph (EEG) device for neurological data acquisition for the clinical, academic, and research communities. The ambulatory seizure monitoring device will enable an end-to-end system for robust, lightweight, data transmission to a cloud service, which will generate reports for the physician to analyze a patient neurological data for treatment. This system will extend the current rise of health devices into the complex environment of neurological states, as well as the eventual development of neuro-analytics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
