 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the 2023 Gordon Research Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry. The theme of the conference is \u201cFundamental Chemistry and Societal Changes: Shaping Air Quality and Climate from the Molecular to the Planetary Scale.\u201d This conference brings together researchers from universities, government laboratories, and private research institutes, to promote the discussion of information and ideas on topics of contemporary interest in atmospheric chemistry. The workshop concentrates on the latest developments in the field, including the fundamental understanding of chemical processes from the molecular level to global impacts on Earth and space.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this symposium lies in bringing together leaders and scholars in experimental and modeling studies covering a broad range of research in the field of atmospheric chemistry, including research on the sources, sinks, transport, transformation and impacts of gases and aerosols in the atmosphere through models, observations, and experiments. This conference will have sessions on the following topics: atmospheric chemistry and policy, chemistry of aerosol formation, evolving urban atmosphere, aerosol-cloud-chemistry interactions, aerosol particle chemistry and properties, chemical evolution of aerosol physical properties, remote environments from the ocean surface to Saturn\u2019s moons, advancing models of short-lived climate forcings, and methane sources and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the symposium derive from the exchange of ideas that help to focus the research community on the most pressing questions, as well as provide an opportunity for young scientists to meet, network, and exchange ideas with leaders in the atmospheric and sciences.  Young scientists are also invited to the ACCESS colloquium (\u201cAtmospheric Chemistry Colloquium for Emerging Senior Scientists\u201d) that immediately precedes the conference. The Gordon Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry creates a broad intellectual impact on the atmospheric scientific community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
