 "awd_abstract_narration": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects 1.5 million Americans and 20\u201340 million people worldwide. While a broad understanding of T1D has been gained over the past few decades, a cure for T1D is still not available. Researchers at Michigan State University and the University of Texas at Austin are collaborating to develop a novel framework for continuous, precise, and closed-loop control of bi-hormone (insulin or glucagon) secretion, using tiny wireless optoelectronic implants. This research is the first attempt to use optogenetic tools, using an array of highly efficient, implantable, Wireless (untethered and battery-free) OptoElectronic Implants (WOEIs) with a negligible footprint and minimal invasiveness to control bi-hormone secretion from islet organoids. This approach should pave the way for developing a new technological therapy for T1D. The direct benefits to millions of affected individuals worldwide include improved quality of life and reduced cost of associated medical care.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to develop a closed-loop framework for rapid, selective, and precise control of bi-hormone secretion from genetically modified islet organoid grafts, using highly efficient, implantable WOEIs. The WOEI will monolithically integrate a dual-color optical stimulator and an optical glucose sensor with a wireless system-on-chip in an ultra-small and lightweight package. A distributed array of such WOEIs can simultaneously control many islet organoids for large volumetric coverage and better uniformity. A wireless backpack worn by the animal will carry highly efficient wireless electronics for safe power transfer from a wireless power cage to the WOEIs, and wideband data communication with the WOEIs and with the end-user. An interactive user interface hosted on a personal device (i.e., personal computer, smartphone, etc.) will receive and analyze glucose-sensing data in real-time and control optogenetic modulation in a closed-loop manner. This project is multidisciplinary and will significantly impact research and technological development in biomedical devices, stem cell biology, and wireless microelectronics. Furthermore, this project is expected to have a broad impact on engineering-/health-related STEM education through the integration of research with diverse educational and outreach activities, such as project demos/field tours, graduate and undergraduate research, teacher training, K-12 curricula, new course components, social media, and YouTube programs. These efforts will collectively benefit the broader society by providing effective personalized therapies for T1D management, engaging significant underserved populations, promoting biomedical research for personalized medicine, and training the US STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
