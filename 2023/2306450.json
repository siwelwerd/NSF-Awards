 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Central State University\u2019s Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences (SBS) seeks to develop a Forensic Studies minor, featuring interdisciplinary studies between Chemistry, Social Sciences and Behavioral Sciences, emphasizing cultural diversity and enhanced understanding of STEM fields associated with forensics. Given that African Americans are underrepresented in forensic fields, this project leverages student interest in forensics at an HBCU to increase workforce diversity through evidence-based, innovative techniques including training in inquiry-based scientific experimentation.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project include: 1) developing a new forensics course in each of the following fields - psychology, social work, anthropology, 2) establishing a Forensic Studies Laboratory to bolster the technological capacity of the institution and serve as a teaching and learning space for forensic courses, and 3) creating a Forensic Studies minor that requires students to complete 24 semester credit hours in multiple STEM disciplines. The proposed minor degree program combines training in cultural diversity and understanding with the basic scientific principles and methods that undergird forensic STEM fields. The required and elective forensic science chemistry immerses students in the fundamental laboratory rules and methodologies used in forensic toxicology, serology, and DNA analyses. In addition, STEM social science courses such as Crime Scene Analysis and Introduction to Forensic Anthropology expands students\u2019 STEM education by focusing on the evidence collection methods at crime scenes, whereby students will gain hands on experience. It is anticipated that efforts to expand and strengthen the institutional academic offerings in forensics has the potential to contribute to increased workforce diversity in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
