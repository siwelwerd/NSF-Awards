 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation, the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research in response to the solicitation of proposals that promote the recovery, recycle, and/or reuse of helium, which was initiated by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. West Virginia University is acquiring a helium recovery system to capture and reliquefy helium from five NMR spectrometers to support the research of Professor Terry Gullion along with colleagues Gregory Dudley, Brian Popp, Jessica Hoover, and Carsten Milsmann. This equipment supports research in the areas of synthetic organic and inorganic chemistry, medicinal and structural biochemistry, physical organic chemistry, and NMR methodology development.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. Using the intrinsic magnetic properties of atomic nuclei, it is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The superconducting magnets of these instruments rely on regular deliveries of liquid helium to maintain their operation. However, the instability in the helium supply due to global and national challenges jeopardizes research programs relying on NMR spectroscopy. A helium recovery system collects the helium boiloff from the superconducting magnets of NMR spectrometers and then reliquefies the helium for reuse. This equipment supports the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students, including undergraduates from groups underrepresented in STEM and first-generation students, at all levels in multiple departments and the surrounding community.  \r\n\r\nThis award is aimed at supporting research and education at all levels. Specifically, this helium recovery system collects the helium boiloff for reliquefication and reuse from the superconducting magnets which sustains the operation of the institution\u2019s five NMR spectrometers. The NMR instrumentation supported by this equipment enables research projects focused on chemical synthesis and methodology, medicinal chemistry, and reaction technology development.  The research supported also involves the development and mechanistic study of catalytic oxidation reactions and sustainable (photo)chemistry with earth-abundant metals.  Additionally, the recovery system aids in supporting investigations focusing on the methodology development and optimization using organometallic catalysis and the development of protein-protein interaction inhibitors.  Other research areas include the development of new MRI contrast agents and single molecule magnets, NMR methodology development, and the characterization of insect wing membranes using solid-state NMR.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
