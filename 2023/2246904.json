 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Synthesis Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Neil Garg of the University of California, Los Angeles is pursuing the chemical synthesis of an important molecule that possesses interesting chemical properties and an interesting structure. Chemists synthesize such molecules for the purpose of pushing the boundaries of known chemical technologies. What is learned from these studies provides the foundation for discovery in numerous fields, including agrochemistry, materials science, and drug discovery. Professor Garg also maintains efforts to promote science and science education to the general public. His outreach activities and initiatives challenge existing paradigms in undergraduate education and render the notoriously difficult subject of organic chemistry accessible to a broader audience. \r\n\r\nProfessor Garg is studying the complex molecule dodecahedrane.  The chemical structure resembles the well-known dodecahedrane shape and is comprised of carbon and hydrogen atoms. This molecule is of longstanding scientific interest and is a notorious challenge for synthetic chemistry. The key transformations in this synthesis are also of interest from a mechanistic perspective. Forays in chemical synthesis, such as these, define the scope and limitations of known reactions and advance the modern state of synthetic chemistry. With regard to educational initiatives, Professor Garg is redefining the landscape of chemical education. He is developing online resources for students, children, and the general public, with a particular interest in engaging people in organic chemistry and helping people visualize the 3-dimensional structures of molecules.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
