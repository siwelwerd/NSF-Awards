 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is the support for the economic development resulting from a diversified chemical feedstock. Primary phosphines, organophosphorus compounds containing a single organic substituent, are important chemical precursors. Their use can benefit agriculture, biomedicine, materials science, and consumer goods by supporting efficient preparation of a wide range of known, useful products that benefit society as well as to help develop new products. Current technology that produces primary phosphines is highly wasteful and hazardous. This project\u2019s technology provides these products with increased safety and reduced waste, which can expand domestic chemical production. This project leverages catalysis and supports further growth of this environmentally friendly, multi-billion-dollar industry. The project team has a strong record of involving individuals from marginalized identities in science to expand the future STEM workforce. Such efforts will continue to serve national and state workforce development goals. Additionally, part of this project will aid in the long-term development of entrepreneurship education to yield regional students who will be better prepared for technology transfer and conversion of science to market-ready products in the future. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project seeks to transition an NSF-funded discovery to a viable marketplace technology. To meet this goal, Lewis acid catalysis will be used to prepare primary phosphines. Lewis acid catalysis has become a topic of tremendous interest including recognition by the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Application of these cutting-edge discoveries will address the key challenge in primary phosphine synthesis, which is to move away from hazardous metal-based reducing agents. Goals of the project include expansion of the primary phosphines that can be prepared by this method, exploration of alternative catalysts including solid state catalysts, and preparations for growth to pilot scale production. The applied research plan directly addresses the more practical utilization of Lewis acid catalysis in the preparation of value-added products. The project aims to support new technology and new products in the marketplace. In meeting these goals, opportunities for Lewis acid catalysis in the preparation of commodity chemicals will be expanded through a greater understanding of their reactivity, especially at scale. The ability to utilize alternative Lewis acids would also be realized through this project, and additional aspects of phosphorus chemistry will be understood.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
