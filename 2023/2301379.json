 "awd_abstract_narration": "From September 18-20, 2022 Hurricane Fiona delivered more than 64 cm of rainfall to the island of Puerto Rico. This excessive precipitation caused mass wasting and flooding across the island, similar to the effects of Hurricane Mar\u00eda in 2017. Both events represent extraordinary opportunities to study the impact of tropical cyclones on the evolution of a high relief, tropical landscape. This project will support two deployments of scientists and equipment to collect time-sensitive and perishable data from two catchments in southern Puerto Rico strongly impacted by mass wasting after the hurricane. Using these catchments as a model study area the investigators will: 1. survey the topography of landslide deposits, scars, and post-landslide river aggradation using drone-based structure-from-motion photogrammetry; 2. collect samples of river sediment downstream of landslide areas for grain size analysis and cosmogenic nuclide tracing of landslide-derived sediment, 3. monitor and record the movement of still-unstable landslides and actively aggrading river channels with time-lapse cameras. The project will be collaborative with co-investigators based in Puerto Rico and coordinated in concert with federal and local scientists working in hazards assessment and prevention. Field work deployments will engage at least 3 graduate and 3 undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nFor more than sixty years, geologists have debated the contribution of large, yet infrequent storm events to the long-term evolution of eroding landscapes. For large storms like tropical cycles, the immediate geomorphic impact to tropical landscapes may be obvious: mass wasting and flooding. However, the extended response of tropical landscapes to the storm event is often more complex, and measurement of landscape response requires repeated observations across a catchment area, beginning immediately after the storm event. This project supports collection of time-sensitive and perishable data to explore three hypotheses concerning the response of a tropical landscape to landslides and flooding caused by a tropical cyclone. Specifically, the investigators will address the questions: 1. Where (and why) do storm events destabilize hillslopes? by surveying landslide scars and deposits in-person, monitoring still-unstable hillslopes with time-lapse cameras, and mapping landslides regionally with remotely-sensed imagery; 2. How do river networks adjust to an influx of landslide-derived sediment? by measuring channel aggradation/erosion patterns with repeat drone-based topographic surveys and direct tracking of coarse sediment transport using time-lapse images of channels downstream of landslide areas; and 3. What is the residence time of landslide-derived sediment in a tropical landscape? by repeated measurement of cosmogenic radionuclide concentrations in river sediment to detect changes in the flux of landslide-derived sediment over the following year.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The samples are important to help us better understand the effect of widespread landslide-triggering events on the natural environment, especially in terms of sediment flux and chemical weathering in the tropics. The initial 1-year sampling campaign has been completed, and the samples have been sent to be analyzed at specialized laboratories. Specific analyses that are being carried out at this time include Beryllium-10 cosmogenic radio-nuclide abundance in fluvial sediment samples and total dissolved solids / Uranium isotope concentrations in fluvial water samples. With the results, we should be able to better quantify the perturbation to long term geological processes that are brought about by high-intensity, short-duration extreme weather events. \n\n\nThe project was a collaborative effort between the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez and the Georgia Institute of Technology. During the endeavor, undergraduate and graduate students from both institutions received both field and lab training in addition to cross-cultural experiences and exchanges. The RAPID funding was effective to support research during a relatively short time span that would not have otherwise been feasible. Final results of the data from the project are forthcoming and will be published.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KennethSHughes\n"
