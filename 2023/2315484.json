The intent of this workshop is to continue the momentum brought upon by the EarthCube initiative consisting of synergistic interactions between geoscientists and cyberinfrastructure experts.  Early-career participants are especially encouraged to participate to ensure that these interdisciplinary collaborations better serve their needs as they advance through their careers. \r\n\r\nThis geoscience/cyberinfrastructure workshop will spark synergies and discoveries among science and technology experts to advance the goal of transforming research in cyberinfrastructure and the geosciences. To spark collaboration and the sharing of ideas, the two-day workshop will be designed to include cutting edge science talks, demonstrations, executable notebooks, posters, hands-on activities, as well as interactive sessions on making the best use of technologies to advance science. The Building Upon the EarthCube Community Workshop will kick-start the collaborations of a new generation of science and technology experts who will significantly contribute to increasing the impact of the output of NSF and other federally-funded research thereby increasing public and open access to data. To this end, the workshop will support early-career participants through twenty travel awards, with priority given to individuals belonging to groups traditionally underrepresented in the geosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
