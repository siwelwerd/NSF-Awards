 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an increasing need for trained geoscientists to tackle societally relevant issues such as climate change, natural hazards, and energy resources. Meaningful progress on these complex scientific and societal issues will require a diversity of viewpoints and voices. However, the geosciences are one of the least diverse STEM fields. The Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) has developed a program titled Connecting Opportunities for Research Experiences in the Geosciences (CORE) to develop holistic strategies to create more inclusive pathways in the geosciences. This project brings together two highly successful groups within SMM: the St. Croix Watershed Research Station (SCWRS), a field research station specializing in primary research in the geosciences, and the Kitty Andersen Youth Science Center (KAYSC), a group that provides out-of-school programming for hundreds of underserved youth each year with the goals of building leadership and science communication skills, career readiness and workforce development, and fostering appreciation of and confidence in working with STEM. Bringing together these two areas of expertise, along with a community network support of geoscience faculty and professionals, will create an effective, long-lasting, and supportive pathway to geoscience careers.   \r\n\r\nCORE will be built around the KAYSC\u2019s STEM Justice framework, an ecosystem learning model for engaging youth in STEM learning through a justice-focused lens centered around solving real-world community issues. Youth will engage with an ongoing SCWRS research project in paleolimnology focusing on the effects of road salt on lakes in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metro region. Additionally, CORE will build a Community Network of Support of geoscience faculty from regional colleges and universities, as well as geoscience professionals from community-based organizations; this will build a professional support network as program youth take the next steps in geoscience programs or careers. Through the application of the STEM Justice model, CORE will develop strategies to inclusively introduce youth to geoscience research and networks, increasing the likelihood that they pursue college or career pathways in the geosciences. The three project goals are: 1) Train adult mentors/geoscience professionals in STEM Justice practices; 2) Engage young people in a defined and meaningful research project in paleolimnology; and 3) Provide young people with access to geoscience undergraduate programs and careers. By training geoscience professionals in more inclusive practices, engaging youth in relevant geosciences research, and creating systems of support between these groups, we will develop and share a sustainable, inclusive pathway for youth in the geosciences that will live beyond this project and can serve as a model for other institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
