 "awd_abstract_narration": "Counterfactual conditional sentences (e.g., \u201cIf giraffes had fins, they would swim\u201d) involve an antecedent (e.g., \u201cIf giraffes had fins\u201d) which is false in the actual state of affairs. They also involve a consequent (e.g., \u201cthey would swim\u201d), which is true given the antecedent. Reasoning about counterfactual conditionals requires thinking about possibilities, and being able to choose among them in a principled manner. Despite the conceptual complexity involved in temporarily imagining falsehoods as true, humans can readily reason about possibilities arising from counterfactual antecedents. This form of reasoning develops fairly late for children, due to the complexity involved in choosing among different possibilities. To further our understanding of these abilities, the researchers analyze children\u2019s use (i.e., their production and understanding) of these sentences, and the kinds of possibilities children are able to reason over when they are thinking of non-actual state of affairs. Developing and practicing children\u2019s counterfactual reasoning abilities is crucial for both critical and scientific thinking, benefiting children\u2019s ability to control variables when testing hypotheses. Counterfactual reasoning is also closely related to emotional and social development, for example, when understanding regret and relief. By understanding which counterfactuals facilitate development, the researchers encourage children at an earlier age, or when they have developmental difficulties, to respond to counterfactual prompts, and thereby foster more complex forms of reasoning.\r\n\r\nThis doctoral dissertation project answers the following open questions: How do the possibilities arising from counterfactual situations that children think about differ from the ones that adults think about? Do children consider more possibilities than adults when reasoning counterfactually? Finally, do children\u2019s possibilities involve any linguistic and conceptual features which adults do not use? To answer these questions, the researchers conduct five studies. Two studies examine children\u2019s production of counterfactual conditionals \u2013 considering the types of sentences children use, and the ways in which they differ from those of adults, looking at both children\u2019s natural production of counterfactuals (e.g., produced contexts where they are playing or having a casual conversation with a caregiver), as well as production elicited through experimental prompts. The other three studies examine children\u2019s reasoning when hearing counterfactual utterances. The researchers ask targeted experimental questions (e.g., \u201cIf giraffes had fins, could they swim?\u201d) and analyze children\u2019s responses to understand the ways in which the possibilities they reason over differ from those of adults.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
