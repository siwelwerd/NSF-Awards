 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by implementing a novel approach to engage and retain students in STEM. Traditional classroom-focused programs often fail to adequately stimulate interest in STEM and STEM-based research, especially for minority groups underrepresented in their pursuit of STEM fields of study. However, hands-on focused classrooms have been shown to increase minority and female participation in STEM. The use of graphic novels is another hands-on, practical proven technique, as such artifacts are a learning medium that combines both text and visuals to improve student performance. However, the creation of a custom graphic novel can be time-consuming. Thus, this project will focus on using an artificial intelligence/natural language processing (AI/NLP) approach to develop a digital graphic novel curriculum that is personalized to the cultural background and challenge level of the user. The target group of students comprises freshman and sophomores taking a Principles of Biology course because the first two years of college are considered potential \u201cleaks\u201d in the STEM pipeline.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will develop a prototype of the front-end student experience and workflows for digital interaction with a graphic novel curriculum through an intuitive, web-based interface design. An educational curriculum, content, and engaging humor will be integrated with navigation tools to enable transitions into, within, and between different graphical-comedic lessons. The envisioned web app will be developed, tested, and produced on Amazon Web Services. Platform architecture will be composed of three components: electronic data sourcing, student web interface, and a back-end AI engine. This approach will address a paucity of data on the impact of using an effective learning modality such as graphic novels with a predominately historically disadvantaged population in the STEM fields. The success of this project will create a reproducible method for effectively designing, producing, and integrating a customized, culturally responsive graphic novel using an AI/NLP-driven platform into inquiry-based STEM classes, as well as determining its efficacy and impact on student learning gains and STEM course retention. Project findings may have additional implications for increasing minority STEM participation in upper class biology courses and for disciplines outside of biology.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
