 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of US-based researchers in the conference\"Recent Developments and Future Directions in Nonlinear Dispersive and Wave Equations\" which will be held December 10-16, 2023 at Monash University, in Melbourne Australia.  The conference will convene researchers from around the world in the general area of dispersive and wave equations, and will include plenary talks from leading experts, along with shorter talks from earlier-career mathematicians working in these areas.  The award gives early-career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of funding a chance to attend and participate in this conference. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the conference is to bring together researchers working in the area of nonlinear dispersive and wave equations. This is a topic of much current activity and research, with important applications to physics and engineering. Furthermore, this conference aims to bring together physically disparate research communities, which should help advance scientific understanding and create future opportunities for collaboration. More information about the conference is available at: https://sites.google.com/view/dispersive-pde\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
