 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the recent advancements in artificial intelligence, deep learning systems and applications have become a driving force in multiple transdisciplinary domains. While this evolution has been largely supported by the rapid improvements in advanced GPU cyberinfrastructure, comprehensive training materials are generally absent that combine application-driven deep learning techniques with the implementation of such techniques using the GPU cyberinfrastructure. To fill in this gap, this project develops an online workshop that comprises of a set of interdisciplinary cutting-edge training sessions offered by six faculty members from five disciplines. With a focus on the latest innovations in GPU-based deep learning systems and applications, this workshop fosters a community of the next-generation cyberinfrastructure users and contributors, who can use, develop, and improve advanced GPU cyberinfrastructure for their deep learning research. Such training efforts enhance the knowledge of the deep learning and GPU cyberinfrastructure workforce, and subsequently contribute to the solutions of important scientific and societal problems, including hydrographic mapping in geography, space environment nowcasting in aerospace, and autonomous driving and traffic monitoring in transportation. The workshop will also attract trainees from underrepresented groups, including minority students and researchers from rural areas.\r\n\r\nThe interdisciplinary workshop developed in this project aims at enabling participants, including undergraduate seniors, graduate students, and researchers, to improve their multidisciplinary skill-sets, extend their academic research portfolios, develop their remote collaboration capacities, and significantly strengthen their career competitiveness. To achieve this goal, the intensive workshop includes 1) a set of hands-on lecture modules that provide trainees with comprehensive knowledge and skills on the full stack of deep learning systems in advanced GPU cyberinfrastructure, 2) a series of talks on the cutting-edge research in advanced GPU cyberinfrastructure and deep learning systems and application given by renowned scientists invited from academic and industrial research institutes, and 3) a remote open-ended interdisciplinary collaborative project of applying techniques introduced in lectures into practice. In addition, a prototype of an interactive online training system is developed to provide computing resources for the trainees and to track their learning progress, for more effective and efficient training activities. The project is expected to develop a future research workforce in deep learning systems and applications and to broaden the adoption of advanced GPU cyberinfrastructure in research and education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
