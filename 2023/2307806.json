 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most stars form in groups called clusters, which contain stars of very different sizes and masses. Astronomers wish to understand the reasons that only some clusters form massive stars, which have masses more than eight times that of our Sun. The masses of stars in a cluster play an important role in how the cluster changes over time. For example, massive stars influence their surroundings with strong stellar winds and supernovae. Understanding the conditions that dictate the masses of forming stars is therefore important for understanding the ways that galaxies form and change over time. This project will address the question, \u201cwhat properties of a gas cloud influence the masses of stars that will form in a cluster?\u201d To do so, the project studies objects known as yellow-balls (YBs), which were first discovered by participants in a citizen-science project. The research team has developed an activity that provides introductory astronomy students with a way to contribute to the project and gain meaningful research experience. Outreach to seminaries, places of worship, planetaria, and media outlets will educate diverse public audiences about the findings from this project.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will use a database of over 6,000 YBs identified by users of the Milky Way Project on the Zooniverse platform. YBs are signposts of young star-forming regions (SFRs) that trace a broad range of mass (10 \u2013 10,000 solar masses) and luminosity (10\u20131,000,000 solar luminosities). YBs reveal many SFRs that are missing in existing catalogs, which tend to be biased towards the most massive and/or luminous regions. The investigators will produce a catalog of YB properties by cross-matching YBs with catalogs of star formation; determining distances to YBs from molecular cloud associations; determining physical properties of YB environments from catalog associations and our derived distances; and conducting multi-wavelength infrared (IR) photometry.  Trends between YB colors, their physical properties, and their classifications will be identified through statistical analyses, modeling of spectral energy distributions, and the application of machine learning techniques. This research will elucidate the physical thresholds that delineate environments that do and do not produce massive stars and may additionally provide a transformative approach to classifying SFRs across the luminosity, mass, and age spectrum using only IR fluxes.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Astronomy and Astrophysics Grants program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
