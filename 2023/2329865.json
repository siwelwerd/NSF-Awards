 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation \u2013 Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project is to disseminate a transformative three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging technology that provides an accessible and practical solution for comprehensive tissue examination in clinics. The technology has the potential to address technical limitations of 2D imaging and make ultrasound a more reliable tool for early detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of many diseases that disproportionally impact people from low-income and under-resourced communities. The technique also provides the research community with new 3D imaging capabilities to probe the structure and function of deep tissues noninvasively and holistically in vivo, facilitating new discoveries and development of new therapies. The approach equips 2D ultrasound imaging systems with the ability to perform 3D imaging, results in lower costs and increased accessibility, making broad and direct impact on patient care globally. In addition, the technology will provide a viable 3D imaging solution for the ultraportable, pocket ultrasound devices that are becoming increasingly popular. Since many of these devices are not used by trained sonographers, 3D imaging is particularly useful for mitigating operator dependence. As such, the technology becomes essential because it will conveniently enable 3D imaging for the ultraportable at-home ultrasound market. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project presents a highly practical and cost-effective solution to democratize ultrafast 3D ultrasound imaging because it instantly converts existing 2D ultrafast ultrasound imaging systems into 3D-capable devices. The technology addresses the market needs of 3D imaging by working with existing ultrasound systems and probes, lowering financial barriers for new users, breaking existing technical barriers of 3D ultrasound imaging, and enabling advanced imaging modalities that are not possible with conventional techniques. The research objective of this PFI-RP project is to conduct use-inspired research to overcome the knowledge gaps and technical challenges of the 3D imaging technique, making this technology ready to be transferred to the commercial ultrasound market. The proposed project will improve various components of devices to improve imaging quality. The proposal will also develop automated calibration and synchronization methods to facilitate streamlined user experience. Designated control hardware and software interface will be developed for integration with commercial ultrasound systems. Finally, in vivo animal imaging studies will be conducted to evaluate the imaging performance of the new 3D imaging device. Successful completion of this project will culminate in a commercially viable 3D imaging technology that is poised for immediate commercialization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
