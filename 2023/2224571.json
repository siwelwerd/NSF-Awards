 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ocean science is one of the least diverse sciences in the United States. Yet the complex and pressing issues facing the ocean and the needs of ocean-dependent communities require an ocean-literate society with diverse expertise, racial identities, and experiences. This project combines the strengths of two entities, Hampton University and Black in Marine Science, to increase the participation of Black people in marine science related fields and create a sense of belonging through culturally responsive and justice-centered programming. This project is designed to boost ocean literacy and research within Black and other marginalized communities and equip people with tools to solve problems in their changing environment. The project will (1) attract high school students of color into marine science related fields, (2) engage undergraduates through a culturally relevant curriculum, (3) support undergraduates and graduates develop professional skills and build their identity as scientists, (4) prepare undergraduates for marine science-related and STEM careers, and (5) introduce both high school students and undergraduates to research. All activities will be implemented using equitable STEM teaching tools (cultural pedagogies, multi-generational learning, supporting diverse sense-making, centering racial justice, meaningful phenomena, and place-based learning).\r\n\r\nThis project aims to answer the overarching research question: How does participation in the designed project activities improve outcomes and increase racial equity for Black people? The research team will collect data on the experiences and impacts on participants to understand how different aspects of the project affect their knowledge of and sense of belonging in marine sciences. The internal and external evaluation of the project will utilize a culturally responsive and equity-focused approach, mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) data collection strategies, and apply an educative and values-engaged lens. These methods will provide richer data, allow for better data triangulation, higher multicultural validity, and produce more nuanced evaluation results. The broader impacts of this project include scientific publications with key findings from the evaluations, conference, and community presentations to highlight the strength and weaknesses of the programming, curriculum accessible to teachers and lastly, data on attraction, retention, and sense of belonging of participants.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Racial Equity in STEM Education activity (EDU Racial Equity). The activity supports projects that promote racial equity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce development through research and practice. Awarded projects center the voices, knowledge, and experiences of the individuals, communities, and institutions most impacted by the inequities caused by systemic racism in STEM fields. This activity aligns with NSF\u2019s core value of supporting outstanding researchers and innovative thinkers from across the Nation\u2019s diversity of demographic groups, regions, and types of organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
