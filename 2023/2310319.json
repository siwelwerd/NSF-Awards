 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will cover the travel expenses for a workshop on shared infrastructure for development of Machine Learning (ML) tools for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Although machine learning techniques have demonstrated their effectiveness in EDA applications and been adopted in industry, such developments face the bottleneck of tremendous data preparation cost. In addition, private infrastructures hinder the comparability and reproducibility of related results of research. This workshop will bring together related students, academic researchers, industrial experts and government officials to discuss the needs, challenges and solutions regarding shared infrastructure for Machine Learning for Electronic Design Automation and outline a roadmap for future action items. The workshop participants will include attendees from a diversity of population including women, and members of underrepresented groups. The workshop summary report will be disseminated for public consumption.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
