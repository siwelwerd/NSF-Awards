 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF Smart and Connected Communities project will employ a novel and multidisciplinary approach informed by community participation to detect, map, and analyze \u201cnear-miss\u201d events that occur when a collision between a vulnerable road user, such as a bicyclist or pedestrian, and an automobile is narrowly avoided. Rising injury and fatality rates in the United States for vulnerable road users is an area of societal concern, and contribute to public hesitancy to walk or bicycle more. These trends challenge ongoing efforts nationwide that aim to both make roads safer for all and reduce transportation sector emissions through a modal shift to increased walking, bicycling, and transit use. To date, data-driven solutions to address issues related to vulnerable road user safety often rely on official crash data, but these data cannot alone comprehensively represent the safety experiences of vulnerable road users. The ability to more broadly record near-miss events, and how their frequency and locations compare to officially reported crash data, is essential to informing safety-oriented transportation planning strategies. To address this topic, this project will integrate approaches and technological innovations from geography, traffic engineering, and urban planning, in partnership with community collaborators in greater Reno and Sparks, Nevada.\r\n\r\nRecent advancement in classification techniques applied to data collected from Light Detection and Ranging, or LiDAR, sensors provides an ability to detect near-miss events involving vulnerable road users. This project will deploy a portable network of such sensors at locations throughout greater Reno and Sparks. Sensor locations will be informed by responses to a web-based survey distributed to those who frequently walk or bicycle in the community that will prompt them to identify specific locations of vulnerable road user safety concern. Data will be collected at these locations for one week. Emerging near-miss detection methods will be applied to the field-collected data, and frequency and type of near misses will be compared against official crash data. A community focus group will review near miss events detected by these sensors and provide feedback to improve event identification methods. A Geodesign workshop will produce a collaborative plan that will prioritize locations for future assessment of vulnerable road user safety, and identify potential countermeasures. These efforts will help guide ongoing efforts to integrate a sensor network that if effectively scaled, could improve the ability to detect near-miss events in real-time, which in turn can better inform planning efforts to improve road user safety.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A near-miss event is defined as a situation where a crash between a vehicle and a VRU is narrowly avoided, and in this study, we focus on pedestrians and bicyclists. We completed a variety of research activities during this project, drawing on innovative methods from the disciplines of geography, urban planning, and traffic engineering.</p>\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Web-Based Survey of Bicyclists and Pedestrians</strong>: We distributed a web-based survey that collected responses from 172 people who regularly bike or walk in Reno and Sparks. Most expressed high levels of concern about being involved in a crash and low levels of satisfaction with existing infrastructure to support their travel. Using an interactive map, each respondent identified up to 10 locations in the community where they either had experienced a near-miss previously or felt unsafe traveling as a VRU. In this study, &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo; referred to concern about being involved in a crash with a vehicle. We identified the 10 most common locations provided by respondents, mapping these relative to official crash data reported over the previous five years (Figure 1).</p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>LiDAR Sensor Distribution and Data Analysis</strong>: We deployed portable LiDAR sensors at the 10 locations informed by the survey responses, monitoring five different locations over two unique 72-hour time periods. We classified and quantified road user types (vehicle, pedestrian, bicyclist) at each location using the LiDAR data, and then mapped each user&rsquo;s trajectory through each intersection (Figure 2, Figure 3). We identified near-miss events between vehicles and VRUs using the LiDAR trajectory data and a time-based proximity indicator called Post-Encroachment Time (PET). In total, we detected 431 near-misses between VRUs and vehicles at the 10 locations we monitored over the two 72-hour periods. Most occurred during daylight hours and in areas with lower vehicle speed limits and vehicle volumes, and in areas with higher bicyclist and pedestrian volumes. For comparison, 26 crashes between VRUs and vehicles had been recorded at these same 10 locations over the previous five years of available data, indicating how frequently near-miss events occur.</p>\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Focus Group</strong>: We hosted a focus group where 9 members of the public reviewed animations that our team generated of near-miss events using the LiDAR sensors and data, soliciting feedback on what constitutes a near-miss and why. After the focus group, a key conclusion is that events we detected as near-misses could be further classified into three groups: 1) a dangerous near-miss, 2) risky, but calculated VRU behavior, or 3) minimal risk to the VRU despite proximity to vehicles.</p>\n<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Geodesign Workshop</strong>: We organized and hosted a participatory Geodesign mapping workshop with 16 stakeholders who are each working to address road user safety in Reno and Sparks. Participants worked in a structured series of collaborative breakout groups and used an interactive mapping platform to recommend locations to prioritize for future safety assessment and potentially intervention. The group developed a plan of 20 new locations to prioritize in the future, and an initial list of potential feasible countermeasures that could be implemented at each.</p>\n<p>The <strong>intellectual merit </strong>of this study lies in its novel approach to detecting near-miss events in a way that incorporates and is responsive to community input. Coupled with officially reported crash data, these data broaden our understanding of where safety issues occur involving VRUs and vehicles at a fine spatial scale and can be integrated into data-driven solutions to improve road user safety. If only official crash data were used to inform countermeasure planning, some of these 10 intersections identified by bicyclists and pedestrians in Reno and Sparks as unsafe may not have been prioritized, as some had no crashes involving a VRU within the past five years, and none had more than six. This workflow could be replicated elsewhere to collect empirical data on where these events occur and how frequently.</p>\n<p>The <strong>broader impact </strong>of this project is its contribution to addressing a growing problem in the United States: increasing injury and fatality rates of bicyclists and pedestrians. Addressing and improving safety for these groups has several broad societal benefits, as facilitating greater levels of bicycling and walking helps to reduce congestion and local air pollution, improves public health, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. Collecting better data on safety outcomes that includes near-misses in fast-growing, automobile-dependent regions like Reno-Sparks, Nevada using LiDAR technology, data, and analysis that is informed by community feedback can help the process of data-driven infrastructure planning to protect VRUs. The results of this research may be used to develop or augment traffic safety metrics that more readily and systematically incorporate near-misses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 09/09/2024<br>\nModified by: Scott&nbsp;B&nbsp;Kelley</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2243588/2243588_10856272_1725654582310_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2243588/2243588_10856272_1725654582310_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2243588/2243588_10856272_1725654582310_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example of classification output of raw data output at an intersection observed in this study, with road user types highlighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Fei Guan, Hao Xu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Scott&nbsp;B&nbsp;Kelley\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2243588/2243588_10856272_1725653866477_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2243588/2243588_10856272_1725653866477_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2243588/2243588_10856272_1725653866477_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Locations of where LiDAR sensors were deployed relative to near-miss events and unsafe locations provided by survey respondents, along with official crash data</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Scott Kelley</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Scott&nbsp;B&nbsp;Kelley\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2243588/2243588_10856272_1725654652356_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2243588/2243588_10856272_1725654652356_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2243588/2243588_10856272_1725654652356_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">10Hz LiDAR-based trajectory data of vehicles and VRUs at an intersection observed in \nthis study</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Fei Guan, Hao Xu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Scott&nbsp;B&nbsp;Kelley\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
