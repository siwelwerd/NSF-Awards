 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Regional Innovation Engines Development Award is focused on developing the vision and plans for creating a world-class maritime cybersecurity capability for South Carolina and subsequently adopted across the nation's maritime transportation industry. The project intends to be at the vanguard of research, education, workforce development, outreach, and product creation. Innovation efforts will include cybersecurity education, research, experimentation, investment, and commercialization of products and services with national impact. Key partners in this collaboration include the University of South Carolina Beaufort, South Coast Cyber Center, Clemson University, South Carolina State University, the University of South Carolina, South Carolina Council on Competitiveness, Technical College of the Lowcountry, and the South Carolina Research Authority. South Carolina's ports, rail, interstate highways, and strategic position in the southeast United States make it an ideal location for this Development award. The state's maritime transportation system enables critical economic activity for firms and households nationwide. The project's goals include building collaborative partnerships with academia, industry, and government to understand the interdependencies, vulnerabilities, and risks to drive the development of technologies and services that build critical resiliency into the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis project will identify and develop commercially viable maritime cybersecurity solutions and services in concert with building a robust cadre of cybersecurity professionals and technology to drive sustainable and equitable economic growth. A key priority will be the development of a strong cybersecurity workforce among traditionally disadvantaged members of society. The outcomes of this award will more clearly define the current maritime cybersecurity needs and gaps; innovations and solutions to address the gaps; and establish tangible innovation, technology, and workforce development plans needed to address industry challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
