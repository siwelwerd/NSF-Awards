 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building International Scholarship in 4S-Affiliated Journals: A Writing Workshop for Junior Scholars\r\n\r\nThe interdisciplinary field of Science, Technology, and Society (STS) has become increasingly internationalized over the past decade. This is a welcome transformation and is reflected in a range of institutional changes including in the content and editorship of the expanded number of journals affiliated with the largest professional society of the field, the Society for the Social Studies of Science (4S). However, there remains tremendous potential to further internationalize the field. Inequities in publishing and mentorship \u2013 which impact historically marginalized scholars in all disciplines \u2013 have been well documented; efforts to eradicate these inequities are crucial given that robust knowledge production and technology innovation requires barrier-free exchange and opportunities for all. \r\n\r\nTo work toward the goal of internationalizing the authorship pool and bringing STS journals into deeper conversation, a \u201cPublishing in STS\u201d workshop led by a team of editors at 4S-affiliated journals will be held. This workshop will be held immediately before the 4S meeting in November 2023, and will focus on mentoring Early Career Researchers. The workshop will include sessions with the full group that allow students and junior scholars to hear insights and experiences from the journal editors, who are also senior scholars in the field. Topics will include information on the peer-review process and how editors are working to make the review community more diverse and inclusive; insight on English language standards and ideas about publishing in multiple languages; and commentary on resources available for professional development related to publishing in international contexts. The second day of the workshop will focus on small- group sessions in which attendees will receive highly-engaged feedback on a draft article manuscript from the journal editors and from their peers - a conversation that will continue after the Workshop, as editors follow up on the progress of attendees and ongoing peer support is encouraged.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
