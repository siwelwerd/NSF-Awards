 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this RAPID project, the isotopic signatures of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and nitrous acid (HONO) emitted from marine sources and in plumes where marine and urban emissions co-evolve will be characterized. Stable isotope techniques in combination with concentration measurements will be employed as part of the NOAA-supported Atmospheric Emissions and Reactions Observed from Megacities to Marine Areas (AEROMMA) field campaign in the New York City region. This research will provide data and information relevant for assessing effective mitigation strategies for ozone and secondary air pollution over the greater metropolitan NYC area.\r\n\r\nThe stable isotopic composition measurements in this research will help to constrain the sources, sinks, and chemical processing pathways of reactive nitrogen (Nr) species using the isotopic signatures associated with these sources and processes. Field work will be performed at two ground sites: the NYC-CUNY urban site located in Upper Manhattan and the Yale Coastal site in Guilford, CT located downwind of the urban site. This effort includes the characterization and quantification, under different meteorological and pollution conditions, of nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrous acid (HONO), nitric acid (HNO3), and particulate nitrate (p-NO3-) through measurements of emission factors, concentration profiles, and nitrogen and oxygen stable isotopic composition in high time resolution. The project includes the participation of both a graduate and an undergraduate student.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
