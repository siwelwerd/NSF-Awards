 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mountain ranges of western North America, often collectively called the North American Cordillera, are excellent examples of ancient plate tectonic systems associated with collisions between oceanic and continental plates. However, it is unclear how the southern U.S. Cordillera fits within this collisional framework. Several features of the southern U.S. Cordillera suggest that the region may have been characterized by an elevated plateau, similar to today's elevated plateau in the Great Basin area of Nevada. At present, there is no accepted mechanism or theory for how the crust may have been thickened in the southwestern U.S. to create this plateau. This project will test whether an elevated plateau and associated thickened crust previously existed in the southern Arizona region and determine the mechanisms by which such a plateau could have been constructed. This project is led by a first-time NSF investigator at the University of Wyoming, includes a first-generation Hispanic Ph.D. student, and will incorporate undergraduate student research projects. Students will gain experience in laboratory and field methods, including geologic mapping. Project participants will also create a series of short-format videos for public release that document research activities of the project.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to test the hypothesis of whether an orogenic plateau, the \"Arizonaplano\" existed in the southern U.S. Cordillera during the late Mesozoic to early Cenozoic and constrain the mechanisms by which such a plateau could have been constructed. The initial phase of this work will use geochemical indices (e.g., La/Yb) from intermediate arc-related igneous rocks to determine paleo-crustal thickness. The second phase will include new geologic mapping and structural analyses in a series of mountain ranges in southern Arizona to determine whether low-angle, \"Sevier-style\" thrust faults exist, were regionally extensive, and could have thickened the crust. Recent discoveries and preliminary mapping provides an opportunity to correlate structural units across mountain ranges and assemble regional-scale cross sections for tectonic syntheses. The final phase of this research will link the tectonothermal history of Cretaceous to Paleogene sedimentary rocks to the deformation history of the region. This work has important relevance beyond the regional study area by helping to constrain the Mesozoic evolution of the Cordilleran orogen in the southwestern U.S.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Tectonics program in the division of Earth Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A belt of high-silica anatectic granites, formed by crustal melting, was also recognized in this region and determined to be Paleocene to Eocene in age (60 to 40 million years old). Detailed studies of these rocks indicate that maximum temperatures in the deep crust reached up to ~850 C, the first temperature estimates for this region. High temperatures and evidence for crustal melting also support the hypothesis that an orogenic plateau was present in the study area. Previous studies have linked regions with thickened crust to high Cu (copper) concentrations and the formation of Cu-porphyries, which may help explain the abundance of Cu mines in southern Arizona.\r\n\n\nAnother question we sought to answer in this project is how the crust in southern Arizona was thickened. Prior to this study, the leading paradigm for southern Arizona was that contractional deformation during Late Cretaceous to Paleogene time was accommodated by relatively high-angle reverse faults. Relatively low-angle faults, including thrust faults, are required to stack rocks up and significantly thicken the crust. We recognized several thrust faults in the region and reinterpreted several faults as thrust faults, consistent with the evidence for thick crust.\r\n\n\nThe recognition of thrust faults supports another outcome of the project  the interpretation of the southern U.S. and northern Mexican Cordillera as an orogenic wedge.
