 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant synthetic biology is rapidly becoming a field of great economic importance in a broad variety of industries, including medicine, energy, and agriculture. The pace of this advancing field requires the timely collective expertise of scientists, chemical and biological engineers, and mathematicians to develop accurate modeling systems, optimize high value chemical production, and ultimately manufacture essential feedstocks on an industrial scale in a manner which is both sustainable and economically viable.\r\n\r\nThe 6th International Conference on Plant Synthetic Biology, Bioengineering, and Biotechnology will bring researchers working in academia and industry both domestically and abroad to discuss newly uncovered scientific knowledge, integrate these findings into groundbreaking solutions, and provide a forum that can introduce students to the possibilities of a career in plant synthetic biology. Organized by the Society of Biological Engineering (SBE), a technological community within the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), this conference will host a diverse group of attendees, including both established professionals in the field and students at all stages of their careers. This award provides support for broadening participation of students and early career professionals to attend the conference, participate in the discussions, and network with representatives from industry, academia and government. \r\n\r\nThe award is co-funded by the Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (BIO/IOS), the Systems and Synthetic Biology program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (BIO/MCB), and the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (ENG/CBET).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
