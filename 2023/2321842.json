 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of an economical and climate-friendly method to produce valuable commodity chemicals from inexpensive feedstocks such as chemical waste streams. Chemical manufacturing accounts for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions: waste produced from manufacturing battery chemicals and recycling Lithium batteries could be converted back into input chemicals. The technology focuses on developing new electrodes that use electricity to produce acid and base from sulfate-containing waste streams. This innovation will stimulate the US manufacturing sector by improving energy efficiency, competitiveness, and environmental sustainability. This technology could eliminate 3 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions through electrification of chemical manufacturing, while recycling or eliminating the production of a hazardous waste. Moreover, the technology is more economical than current methods, increasing the likelihood of widespread adoption. Replacing outdated manufacturing plants with clean, efficient electrolysis systems would provide high-paying jobs and tax revenue for the region.\r\n\r\nConventional salt electrolysis systems rely on titanium electrodes coated with a precious metal catalyst (e.g., iridium oxide) to enable efficient operation. The metal catalysts used for these coatings are expensive, rare, and fragile. This means that the capital cost of existing salt splitting systems is high, while their operating conditions (e.g., temperature, current density, and operating efficiency) are fairly limited. This innovation will develop gas diffusion electrodes that can help produce acid and base electrolytically from sulfate waste streams at industrial cost parity. The unique microstructure and materials design of the electrodes minimizes the use of precious metal catalysts to lower costs, enhances lifetime for robust operation under corrosive environments, and achieves higher operating temperature (>75 C) and improved current density (5000 A/m2) for lower operating costs. In this project, Design-of-Experiment principles will be used to determine the best combinations of binder, catalyst, and filler/support materials to outperform conventional systems. Optimal chemical and electrochemical properties will be sought for high electrical conductivity, ability to withstand corrosion in highly acidic environments, and minimal oxidative dissolution of catalyst. The durability and efficiency of the new electrodes will be tested first at the lab scale (25 cm2) for 100 hours and then scaled up to 500 cm2 cells for pilot-scale analysis. In all studies, actual sodium sulfate waste obtained from industrial partners will be utilized. The effects of impurities ions in the feed stream on the electrode and membranes will be tracked via spectroscopy and electron microscopy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
