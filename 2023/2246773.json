 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 19th International Conference on Permutation Patterns will be held July 3-7, 2023, at the University of Burgundy in Dijon, France.  The 20th International Conference on Permutation Patterns will be held in June 2024, at the University of Idaho in Moscow, ID.  These are part of a series of annual conferences on permutation patterns that have been held annually since 2003 (with virtual substitutes during the Covid pandemic), rotating mostly between many different institutions in North America and Europe. Each year the conference features two plenary talks and around thirty-five contributed talks, both giving researchers the opportunity to present and discuss their results and giving newcomers to the study of permutation patterns a broad perspective on the subject as a whole.  The conference provides an opportunity for collaboration between junior and senior researchers as well as between researchers from all parts of the world, and there will be time set aside for open problems to be discussed by the entire community.  The conference attracts broad participation, including significant numbers of women and of faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions.  This award supports travel to the conferences by student and early career participants from the United States.\r\n\r\nThe conferences will feature research on permutation patterns and their applications.  Permutation patterns is an interdisciplinary area with roots in both theoretical computer science and combinatorics.  Major themes include the structural properties of permutation classes, asymptotic behavior from both enumerative and probabilistic points of view, extremal questions, algorithmic and decidability questions, and automated theorem proving and discovery.  There are applications to other areas of mathematics and computer science as well as to biology.  The website for the conference series is http://permutationpatterns.com, and specific information about the 2023 conference can be found at http://2023.permutationpatterns.com\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
