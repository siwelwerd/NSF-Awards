 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growing demand for skilled bioscience lab technicians is important to the future economic success of Iowa. Increasing the biotechnology workforce is also recognized as a vital factor in the U.S. economy and national interests. The need for qualified, entry-level biotechnology laboratory technicians is expected to continue to grow through the upcoming decade. In order to meet the evolving needs of the biotechnology industry, it is important to inform high-school students about the many opportunities available to them within this field of study. One of the most effective methods for introducing high-school students to a career field and keeping them engaged in the pursuit of education is direct interaction with professionals in the industry. This three-year project from Des Moines Area Community College (DMACC) will provide a Science Academy opportunity, allowing for high-school students to interact directly with biotechnology industry professionals through classroom visits, career fairs, and on-site tours, thus exposing students to the many career options available within the field. This method is especially effective for reaching populations who have been underrepresented in their pursuit of careers in biotechnology. Additionally, a Summer Workshop will be developed to educate high-school teachers on the use of biotechnology methods and bioinformatics in the classroom. The workshop will also provide opportunities for teachers to learn about the biotechnology industry through on-site tours and talks with industry professionals. Alongside high school outreach activities, a Business and Industry Leadership Team will be established to evaluate and modify DMACC\u2019s biotechnology curriculum. This team will ensure that students completing the AS/Biotechnology Laboratory Methods Certificate receive high-quality, hands-on technical training that is directly applicable to entry level careers in biotechnology, and that students develop an educational foundation to support future growth in their roles within the biotechnology industry. As part of the DMACC Biotechnology Program curriculum updates, an introductory scientific computing course will be developed and equipment will be updated to align with industry standards. Integrating industry partners, secondary and postsecondary educators, and biotechnical professionals to learn and participate in growing programs such as this through academies, workshops, and conferences is designed to advance the STEM workforce and increase equity in opportunities in the field. \r\n\r\nThe project goal is to increase the overall number of students entering the biotechnology workforce pathway and to ensure that biotechnology educational experiences align with industry needs. Approximately 75 high school students are expected to participate in the Science Academy throughout the duration of this three-year project, and an anticipated 48 teachers will receive instruction, networking with industry partners, and biotechnology activity materials during the Summer Workshop, to replicate these experiences for students at their schools. As a result of outreach and education provided through these grant activities, 85 students are expected to complete DMACC\u2019s AS/Biotechnology Laboratory Methods Certificate combination degree. In order to ensure that the Biotechnology program remains astride with evolving industry, project faculty will receive training in cutting edge techniques and equipment, as directed by the advisory Business and Industry Leadership Team. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
