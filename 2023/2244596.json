 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish a new REU site in Cloud Computing Security and Privacy at\r\nBoise State University (BSU). Cloud computing is a relatively new internet computing\r\nparadigm, having been developed and popularized only in the last decade. With the\r\nwidespread applications deployed in the internet, both the volume and types of cyberattacks\r\ncontinue to increase and target every internet user. National infrastructure,\r\nindividuals, businesses, and agencies have fallen victim to cyber-attacks. Developing a\r\nsecure cloud computing environment requires computer science and cybersecurity\r\nprofessionals with interdisciplinary knowledge and skills of software engineering, network\r\nsecurity, system security, cryptography, risk analysis, ethics and human behaviors,\r\nsecurity policies and laws, and many other security practices. To better defend the\r\nvaluable digital assets against cyber-attacks, it is an urgent national priority to make the\r\ninternet/cloud more secure. To answer the call, this REU site will recruit self-motivated\r\nstudents and provide them with a variety of cutting-edge research topics in cloud security\r\nand privacy. This will also help address the shortage in the cybersecurity workforce for the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThis REU site will offer a nine-week summer research program for ten undergraduate\r\nstudents each year to gain research experience. The objectives of this project are to (1)\r\nrecruit a diverse pool of motivated students from underrepresented groups and institutions\r\nwith limited research opportunities; (2) help students develop broad research skills by\r\nconducting timely and important research projects; and (3) promote cybersecurity\r\neducation \u2013 encourage students to pursue graduate studies and to develop a career\r\ninterest in cybersecurity. In order to provide students a better research experience and\r\nscaffold their development as a researcher, in addition to the research training, weekly\r\nseminars, and professional talks in the field of cloud security and privacy, students will also\r\nhave the chance to attend a variety of activities to enhance their research skills offered by\r\nthe BSU summer research community. These additional activities include: (1) seminars for\r\ndiscussing an array of topics, including responsible and ethical conduct of research, critical\r\nthinking, library research activity, poster presentation, and tips to presenting research to a\r\npublic audience; and (2) a two-day Idaho Conference of Undergraduate Research (ICUR)\r\nthat brings together undergraduate students of diverse disciplines to showcase their\r\noriginal work in poster presentations to public audience. At the end of the summer\r\nprogram, the faculty mentors will continue to work with students to publish their research\r\nresults and advise them with graduate program applications or career planning as needed.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by CISE and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
