 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the global distribution of two main ocean properties. One is the fraction of wind-related energy that propagates into the ocean\u2019s interior compared to the energy that is dissipated near the ocean\u2019s surface, referred to as \u2018transmissivity\u2019. The second property to study, also related to wind-induced energy in the ocean, is the fraction of energy that goes into mixing compared to the total dissipative energy (mixing plus dissipation), also known as \u2018mixing efficiency\u2019. The study will use a high-resolution (order few meters), process-based numerical model, the \u2018wave-vortex model\u2019 to determine the interaction mechanisms associated with transmissivity and mixing efficiency, and to calculate them on a global scale. The result will assess the role of wind-driven oscillations, in the interior of the ocean, on the ocean\u2019s energy budget, which shall improve models of ocean circulation and climate. The study will support an early-career female researcher, who will help other junior scientists improve presentation skills through an annual mentoring program, also sponsored by NSF (MPOWIR). The project will produce materials for an additional yearlong mentorship program, as well as enhance educational materials that are disseminated via a web site.\r\n\r\nThis study will investigate the global distribution of two parameters related to wind forcing on the ocean. One global parameter is the \u201ctransmissivity,\u201d which is the portion of wind-related energy that propagates into the ocean\u2019s interior compared to the energy that is dissipated near the ocean\u2019s surface. The second global parameter is the \u201cmixing efficiency,\u201d which is the fraction of energy that goes into mixing compared to the total dampening energy (mixing and dissipation). The study will use a high-resolution, process-based numerical model, the \u2018wave-vortex model\u2019 to determine the nonlinear interaction mechanisms associated with the two global parameters, and to calculate them on a global scale. The result will be a quantification of the role of wind-driven near-inertial oscillations in the ocean\u2019s energy budget. This quantification shall benefit ocean-basin circulation and climate models. The study will support an early-career female researcher, who will help other junior scientists improve presentation skills through the MPOWIR program. The project will produce materials for a yearlong mentorship program, as well as enhance educational materials in a web site.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
