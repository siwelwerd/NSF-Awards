 "awd_abstract_narration": "Though a small body of prior research on health misinformation exists, there is a pressing need to gain a better understanding of how to detect, monitor and understand misinformation and its impact on population health during emergencies. This qualitative study investigates the role of misinformation in Alaska\u2019s response to Covid-19 using systems mapping and data gathered from semi-structured interviews. The project takes a One Health approach, documenting perspectives of public health officials and healthcare providers on misinformation. \r\n\r\nThe field of infodemiology investigates the determinants and distribution of health misinformation and its effects on public and individual health. This research investigates qualitative impacts of misinformation on individuals, private entities, and public agencies in Alaska using the OH-SMART (One Health Systems Mapping and Analysis Resource Toolkit) framework. Methods include semi-structured interviews and snowball sampling of public health personnel and healthcare providers. Project results will be disseminated via a dissertation, peer-reviewed journal articles, and conference presentations. The co-PI also plans to engage the public via social media and to develop a digital dashboard.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
