 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RUI award funds the research of Professor John T. Giblin, Jr. at Kenyon College.\r\n\r\nWe live at a time when telescopes and gravitational wave-observatories are showering us with data.  At the same time, there are still great unanswered questions about the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and the high-temperature initial moments of the Universe.  As part of his research, Professor Giblin will probe high-energy physics using precision numerical simulations to predict the consequences of different models of high-energy physics.  Professor Giblin will continue to develop, along with his undergraduate research students, cutting-edge computational tools to study the complex particle physics in the extreme environments of the early universe.  This work is in the national interest as it builds foundational understanding of high-energy physics, trains scientifically literate human resources, and strengthens our understanding of numerical methods.  Additionally, it will bring these important topics to high schools through outreach into physics classrooms.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, Professor Giblin will study the detailed physics of (p)reheating at the end of inflation by studying realistic beyond-the-standard-model scenarios and implementing full non-linear gravitational simulations to better understand if cosmological processes can create primordial black holes.  Professor Giblin will also study cosmological processes in the late universe to look at how nonlinear physics might contribute to our understanding of dark matter, the Hubble tension, and dark energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
