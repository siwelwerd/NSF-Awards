 "awd_abstract_narration": "A growing number of American industries have voiced a need for a large pool of skilled technicians to fill available and emerging jobs in a variety of economic sectors.  Community Colleges are uniquely suited to align with regional industries to train the skilled technical workforce.  Many career and technical education (CTE) courses require pre-requisite mathematics courses that have been a barrier for students.  There is a well-documented fear of mathematics that has been shown to keep otherwise capable students from pursuing degrees and certificates in CTE programs.  Independence Community College (ICC) will use an evidence-based, hands-on approach that will leverage the capabilities of a 3D fabrication lab to provide context for CTE specific mathematics courses.  Through active learning strategies, the team will encourage students to embrace relevant connections between mathematical concepts and skills that are essential in fields like advanced manufacturing.  Independence Community College will establish a Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) to further guide and contextualize mathematics content to address the needs of regional employers.  Over the three-year period, ICC expects to increase success rates in mathematics courses, and persistence rates in CTE programs.  \r\n\r\nTwo parallel strategies that inform this project are: 1) the establishment of a BILT, and 2) utilization of an on-campus Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) certified fabrication laboratory to contextualize mathematics instruction using active learning strategies. In addition to curriculum guidance, the BILT will augment CTE programs with mock interviews, guest lectures, and other personalized interactions. The ICC fabrication laboratory will make use of their digital fabrication equipment, design software, and studio space to add context to traditional mathematics instruction for students in CTE programs.  The ICC Fab Lab is a member of the International Fab Lab network, originally initiated by MIT. The Fab Lab manager at ICC will work with ICC's mathematics instructors to develop curricula that aligns with skills desired by regional industry, and the natural curiosity of students. Successful practices from this project will be disseminated throughout the state, and beyond through the International Fab Lab network. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
