 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gas separation processes play a crucial role in chemical and fuel manufacturing and in reducing atmospheric emissions. Nanomaterial-based membranes hold immense potential to achieve more efficient and sustainable gas separations. These membranes, composed of atomically thin (2-dimensional or 2D) layers, allow the desired gas molecules to pass through with minimal resistance and high selectivity while blocking the passage of others. The arrangement of interparticle spacing and nanochannel pathways within the membrane layers determines the movement of molecules across it. Unfortunately, controlling these interlayer structures using existing large-scale membrane fabrication methods is difficult, hindering the effective commercialization of the most promising 2D nanomaterial-based membranes. This research project addresses the challenge of controlling molecular separations and nanoscale interlayer structures by developing an innovative approach to membrane fabrication that utilizes variable magnetic fields to manipulate the formation of nanochannels. The anticipated outcomes of this project include a functional 2D nanomaterial-based membrane with superior molecular transport properties and a novel technique for membrane fabrication, opening up new avenues for novel mixed-matrix-membrane filler materials. In addition to its technical contributions, this project will support the growth and development of two Ph.D. students and two undergraduate researchers. By engaging in this project, these students will acquire valuable technical and professional skills, positioning themselves for future careers in STEM fields. Furthermore, the project will actively involve the community through service and experiential learning activities and collaborations with K-12 schools. This engagement aims to foster societal well-being by creating knowledge-sharing opportunities and inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the need for a scalable two-dimensional (2D) lamellar membrane fabrication method to control nanochannel formation reliably, imparting superior selectivity and gas transport properties. The investigator anticipates that applying a controlled magnetic field to a paramagnetic 2D nanomaterials assembly during lamellar membrane fabrication will result in membranes with tunable selective nanochannels, where the applied field strength modulates the nanochannel formation mechanism. To determine the feasibility of this membrane fabrication concept, room temperature paramagnetization will be introduced into 2D nanomaterials through ion intercalation. A uniform magnetic field will be applied to achieve homogenous nanoparticle deposition, and the ability to control nanochannel size via the applied field strength will be evaluated. The agglomeration tendency will be assessed while using a magnetic field-induced assembly at high nanoparticle loading. Finally, the effect of void formation by in-situ nanoparticle migration during mixed-matrix membrane fabrication will be considered.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
