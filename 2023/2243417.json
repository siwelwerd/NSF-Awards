 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to address the national need for diverse, highly qualified STEM teachers in high-need urban settings. Towards this end the project expects to prepare 20 Texas certified math, science or computer science teachers while strengthening a regional educational collaborative for future efforts designed at preparing and supporting STEM educators. Through this educational collaborative, this project will create an ecosystem of STEM education awareness and enriched STEM opportunities for preK-12 students. This collaborative project intentionally connects existing STEM-focused preK-12 programs into a seamless pathway for recruitment, preparation, induction, and retention of diverse STEM teachers for high-need urban public schools. Ultimately, the project will address systemic inequities in access to STEM opportunities. \r\n\r\nIn this project Texas Wesleyan University (TXWES), a small-enrollment urban university in Fort Worth, TX, is partnering with Tarrant County College District (TCCD), an open-access community college district, the Fort Worth Independent School District, a high-need urban local education agency, the Leadership Academy Network, a community-based organization, and the University of Texas at Arlington, a large-enrollment public research university. Two principal goals guide the execution of the project. First is to recruit and prepare 20 mathematics, science, or computer science teachers who obtain a STEM bachelor's degree while securing a standard Texas Teacher certification through Texas Wesleyan University\u2019s Educator Preparation Program. Second is to strengthen and expand partnerships with Fort Worth preK-12 and post-secondary institutions, with an intentional focus on the recruitment, preparation, induction, and retention of STEM teachers, so as to increase the number of highly qualified STEM educators and STEM master teachers in the area. To accomplish these goals, the project will intentionally connect existing STEM-focused preK-12 programs into a seamless pathway for the recruitment, preparation, and retention of STEM teachers for high-need urban public schools. The project will advance knowledge specific to STEM education, STEM teacher certification, induction, and retention in high-need, urban schools. This project provides strategic levers and support throughout the entire teacher development pathway, beginning with elementary students and their families, through the STEM teacher certification process, and culminating with induction support to foster long-term retention of STEM teachers in high-need schools to positively impact the Fort Worth STEM education ecosystem. This project will add to the education research on effective STEM teacher development through a systems approach. Ultimately, the project will build a positive feedback loop to continually build, reinforce, and expand STEM awareness and opportunities for all members of the Fort Worth community. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
