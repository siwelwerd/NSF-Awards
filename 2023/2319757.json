 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop and optimize new techniques to investigate the function of genes in a class of plant pathogens called \u201cdowny mildews\u201d. Many downy mildew species cause destructive diseases of crops that include cruciferous vegetables, peas, cucumbers, and grapes. These pathogens cannot be studied efficiently with conventional genetic and molecular techniques, because of their \u201cobligate\u201d lifestyle in which the pathogens cannot be cultured apart from their host plants. Therefore, little is known about how downy mildews evolve resistance to fungicides and overcome resistance in their plant hosts. The PIs of this project have developed novel techniques, based on RNA interference, to inactivate specific downy mildew genes. This project will optimize the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these techniques and will generalize their applicability for study of diverse downy mildew species. The deliverables will enable the research community to overcome a major obstacle for understanding the molecular mechanisms and evolution of plant diseases caused by downy mildews. In addition, this research will lay important groundwork for the long-term goal of developing RNAi-based biofungicides to control downy mildews and other crop diseases. The project includes outreach to growers and the public about RNAi-based biofungicides for plant disease control, framed in the topical context of \u201cRNA vaccines for plant diseases\u201d. The project will also provide an eclectic training experience for postdoctoral scholars and undergraduate researchers.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop new functional genomic tools for understudied downy mildew pathogens, building on two breakthroughs by the PIs: First, RNA interference (RNAi) can be triggered against downy mildew (DM) genes by mixing short, synthetic, double-stranded RNAs (SS-dsRNAs) in downy mildew spore suspensions. Treated spores are analyzed in isolation or inoculated onto plants to assess pathogen virulence. This approach is surprisingly simple but also prohibitively expensive for large-scale functional genomics and for applications in the field, due to high costs of dsRNA synthesis. Moreover, the approach needs optimization (e.g., to protect dsRNA) and generalization to diverse DM species. Accordingly, the second breakthrough is development of a one-step process for production and encapsulation of dsRNA in anucleate \u201cmini-cells\u201d of E. coli. The resultant minicell-encapsulated dsRNAs (ME-dsRNAs) are protected from environmental degradation, can be shelved for long periods, and provide effective resistance to fungal pathogens when applied as a spray to plants. This protection exemplifies \u201cSpray-Induced Gene Silencing\u201d (SIGS) which has shown promise as a tool for research and control of diseases caused by viruses, fungi, nematodes, and insects. However, neither ME-dsRNAs nor SIGS have been tested on DMs. Therefore, the aims of this proposal are to develop low-cost procedures for production of \u201cnaked\u201d and ME-dsRNA in E. coli and test the RNAi efficacy of these formulations compared to SS-dsRNA. The resultant protocols will circumvent a major bottleneck for genotype-phenotype research on DM-plant interactions, at scales ranging from molecular to evolutionary.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
