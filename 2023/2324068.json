 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the development of an immersive, game-based, learning app to help teach statistics in an engaging way to middle and high school students.  Designed as a classroom resource, the app is aimed at providing a mechanism to promote statistical thinking. The app will integrate research activities into the teaching of statistical concepts and techniques to common core curriculum standards. The game design is expected to increase interest in statistics and also increasing the number of students going into STEM related fields.  \r\n\r\nThis game-based app features artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality learning components tailored to meet students where they are academically and customize fit to each student\u2019s individual interests. This app will be used as a classroom resource. Phase I research and development addresses technical feasibility hurdles such as the development of augmented reality and artificial intelligence features. Other challenges include the development of a user-friendly, seamless application that does not require internet access and a feasible system architecture to integrate the computational engine with the game user interface and ensure reasonable response times. To overcome the inherent technical hurdles, the team will use an agile development cycle that allows for faster development of the finished product, as well as flexibility to respond to changes and requirement updates as they occur.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
