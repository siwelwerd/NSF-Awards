 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides travel support to enable selected graduate students to attend the 2023 Automotive User Interface (AutoUI) Doctoral Colloquium at the International Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular Applications, Ingolstadt, Germany; 18-21 September 2023. The goal of the doctoral colloquium (DC) is to enhance research in the field of automotive user interfaces UI by providing PhD students constructive feedback on researched dissertation topics. This award will help accomplish that goal. The Doctoral Colloquium helps promising PhD students by providing them an opportunity to give presentations of their in-progress research to a panel of senior (established post-doctoral) researchers in the same field. \r\n\r\nThe funding will provide travel support to approximately five graduate students working in topics related to the Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier and the future of automotive user interfaces. The Doctoral Colloquium provides an invaluable opportunity for students to receive mentorship on their work, connect with peers and senior researchers in the field, and helps facilitate professional development by sharing research interests.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
