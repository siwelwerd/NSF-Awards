 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation \u2013 Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to create pathways for using waste plastic from manufacturing in the production of new facade products for the construction industry. Only 8% of plastic discarded in the United States is recycled today, pointing to a clear need for end-of-life solutions to divert plastic waste from landfills or natural ecosystems. This research aims to commercialize a novel technology for forming architectural panels from mixtures of waste plastics. Given changing energy codes in the architecture and construction industry, exterior walls are being built with a continuous layer of insulation covered by finish panels known as rainscreens. This shift is quickly expanding the market for rainscreen panel products. Moreover, new sustainability mandates to reduce the carbon footprint of buildings are incentivizing architects and builders to choose building materials with recycled content. The patented technology featured in this proposal not only enables high percentages of recycled content in each panel, but it also yields varied patterning from panel to panel, recalling the authentic look of natural stone and distinguishing this panel product from competitors. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project addresses key hurdles to producing a consistent architectural product that meets performance and life safety codes while sequestering unwanted post-industrial waste. Focusing on regional waste streams, the research aims to evaluate the viability of thermoplastics generated by a major automotive company\u2019s assembly plants for use as feedstock for the panel forming technology. Differential industry standards regulating automotive components and building components require a thorough review of the material compositions in the available waste streams. However, similar requirements for flame spread, smoke propagation, and UV resistance suggest a high potential for creating a new value chain between automotive waste and fa\u00e7ade construction industries. Testing samples will validate whether new mixtures can meet necessary standards for bringing the technology to the next phase of commercialization. Through this project, the development of a viable mix of materials with recycled thermoplastics will advance research and development of panels for facades into lightweight, low-carbon, durable and safe products.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
