 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop methods for space-based detection of orbital debris. This technology may decrease risks of collisions in space through real-time, accurate identification and modeling of objects within the respective orbits of the spacecraft. The system will also assist with potential path deviations. With the proposed space-based debris awareness technology, techniques could be employed to prevent future collisions and debris damage. A function of such a system could be for designating objects or debris that require emergency orbital removal due to the threats they pose to critical equipment. Additionally, the proposed systems can be used to detect and avoid kinetic attacks as well as the debris fields generated by them. Further, the proposed onboard sensors may detect a broad range of object characteristics, including size, velocity, composition, origin, and intent. Moreover, the solution will assist in intelligence gathering and identifying parties responsible for collisions. The proposed solution addresses the above-stated concerns by integrating orbital debris awareness platforms on host space vehicles to serve as watchdogs for the geostationary and surrounding orbital altitudes.\r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to investigate optimal methods for onboard satellite sensor systems to obtain full spherical space awareness for the host satellites, and thereby allow for better predictive and reactive collision avoidance of hostile threats and orbital debris. This technology could advance novel and transformative solutions for eliminating the threat of satellite collisions with orbital debris and enhance space awareness. The technology will improve space operation risk management margins and permit the space industry's safe growth. The proposed work will include research in three (3) key areas: 1) characterizing the debris environment with regard to detection and tracking in the microwave and optical spectrums using the aggregation of data from sensors currently in orbit; 2) identifying and prescribing optimal detection/tracking methods and technologies within the microwave spectrum to permit sensing of sub-centimeter-sized objects; and 3) pinpointing detection/tracking methods and technologies within the optical spectrum to allow sensing of sub-10 cm sized objects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
