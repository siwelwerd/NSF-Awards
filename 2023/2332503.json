 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST), this project aims to develop a plan for sustainable growth and leadership in gravitational-wave science at California State University (CSU)-Fullerton, a minority-serving institution. Gravitational-wave astronomy has opened a new window on the universe. Next-generation observatories seek to extend our gravitational-wave reach to the edge of the observable universe. This will enable observations of colliding black holes and neutron stars throughout the universe\u2019s history and yield new insights into the nature of the densest matter and the strongest gravity. This project aims to broaden participation in and advance gravitational-wave science through developing an approach to establish a CREST Center that will grow CSU-Fullerton\u2019s research profile to a sustainable, nationally competitive level.\r\n\r\nThe specific aims of this project are to develop a plan for achieving and sustaining national competitiveness in gravitational-wave science at CSU-Fullerton. Center planning will build on lessons learned by previous CREST centers and focus on computational, theoretical, and experimental science. A postdoctoral researcher will work with a diverse group and receive mentoring and training from faculty. This project will strengthen ties between CSU-Fullerton and the Center for Gravitational-Wave Astronomy at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program provides support to enhance the research capabilities of minority-serving institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
