 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop a disruptive technology that reduces the environmental impact of greenhouse-based agriculture while simultaneously improving its economic potential through the application of semitransparent organic solar cells onto the greenhouse glazing (i.e., windows). Greenhouses can be a form of high productivity farming that conserves land and water making them an attractive form of sustainable and climate resilient agriculture. However, greenhouses consume significantly more energy than conventional farming. For greenhouses to be a part of a sustainable agriculture future, there is a need to reduce their energy demand. Prior research has demonstrated that organic solar modules integrated into greenhouse structures may reduce or even eliminate external energy demand while not negatively impacting crop production. The global commercial market of conventional greenhouses will reach $50.6 billion by 2025. The growing greenhouse market translates to gigawatt solar power market size. The added economic benefit of organic solar module adoption in greenhouses provides a path for widespread adoption of organic solar modules and the growing greenhouse market. \r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop flexible, semitransparent, organic solar cells that are tailored specifically for greenhouse glazing integration. The organic solar cells will contribute to the energy production of such greenhouses and may completely eliminate greenhouse energy needs, providing a more environmentally sound form of agriculture. To make this vision of low energy demand greenhouses, there is a need to make high-performance flexible organic solar cells. This solution will be achieved through the optimization of the active layer, the electrodes, and the encapsulation processes. The three primary research tasks are to: (1) produce photoactive inks that are compatible with large-scale coating and have tuned transmittance; (2) achieve high transparency and physically robust, transparent, conducting electrodes based on silver nanowires produced using scalable coating methods; and (3) develop large area, low-cost, transparent, and flexible encapsulation layers. If successful, these solar cells will have advantageous operating characteristics not achievable with other solar cell technologies, providing a unique commercial opportunity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
