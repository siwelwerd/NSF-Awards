 "awd_abstract_narration": "Petroleum-derived polymers, or plastics, play a vital role in everyday life. Unfortunately, they can be difficult to recycle, and plastic waste that enters the environment resists degradation by natural processes. The researchers aim to tackle the critical challenges of plastic waste and pollution by understanding and modeling plastic degradation processes. This knowledge will be instrumental in developing alternative plastic products specifically designed to minimize their environmental impact. To achieve their goal, the researchers plan to develop innovative methods for depolymerizing existing commodity plastics and incorporating environmentally-friendly filler materials, including graphene oxide and proteins. Natural metal salt catalysts will facilitate these processes. The plastic degradation products will be characterized in real-time, and advanced computer simulations will be used to understand the degradation processes. The project centers on a learning and optimization cycle, where knowledge gained from polymer synthesis and modification, real-time analysis, and modeling inform the design of novel plastics with desirable properties. The convergent research approach leverages the team's expertise in polymer, analytical, and environmental chemistry and molecular simulation. Furthermore, the researchers will engage in educational outreach activities to promote environmental science, polymer chemistry, and recycling awareness.\r\n\r\nPolymers derived from petroleum feedstocks have many important applications, but their environmental persistence and inefficient recycling methods pose significant waste management challenges. This project focuses on developing nanocomposite materials from commodity plastics using two approaches: (1) incorporating graphene oxide and (2) introducing protein fillers. The researchers will explore novel catalytic methods involving metal salts to degrade commodity polymers, facilitating the synthesis of nanocomposites. To evaluate the potential of these nanocomposites as replacements for existing plastics, the team will analyze the materials\u2019 thermomechanical properties, permeability, and degradation characteristics. To assess the environmental impact of the materials, the researchers will conduct a detailed molecular-level analysis of the plastic degradation products, polymer interfaces, reaction kinetics, and produced micro/nanoparticles. Additionally, they will use molecular simulation to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, optimize polymer modification reaction conditions, and enhance the performance of these novel materials. The ultimate project objective is to understand polymer degradation processes through sophisticated analytical methods and leverage this knowledge to create superior polymer nanocomposite alternatives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
