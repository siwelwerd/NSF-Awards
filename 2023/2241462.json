 "awd_abstract_narration": "The availability of clean and sustainable energy is of fundamental importance to the global society for all applications of energy, power, mobility and propulsion. The International workshop on sustainable clean energy, power and environment plans to bring together world renowned leaders in selected fields spanning from fuels, biofuels, in current and future platforms of power, mobility and propulsion for cleaner energy harvesting and utilization. It will also bring speakers and audiences from worldwide locations interested in learning the state-of-the-art science and technology in fuels and novel energy conversion devices for seeking solutions to the rapidly growing carbon loading to the environment. It will bring diverse community at the workshop with the international leaders in the field to share their knowledge to provide enriched educational benefits to the society and promote cleaner utilization of fuels to foster healthy sustainable environment. It will also bring awareness to young scientists so that they know the topics of significant importance to work on in their professional careers. The workshop will provide ample networking opportunities in the areas of common interest. The fundamental issues to be addressed include clean utilization of fossil fuels, energy recovery from wastes and low-grade feedstocks for a wide range of applications, as well as education, new challenges and opportunities in the fields of renewable energy, biofuel production and use, and value-added products. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will bring together renowned experts from around the globe to share the latest fundamental and applied research innovations on clean energy harvesting and utilization for a wide range of devices extending from micro scale energy conversion to supersonic and hypersonic propulsion using fossil and biofuels, and different low carbon energy resources. The planned workshop will have several tailored technical tracks with presentations form world renowned technical experts in the field on current and potential future activities. The international workshop will help identify key critical issues faced for the development of novel technologies that show promising viable options for improved, efficient and sustainable utilization of new and novel energy conversion resources, as well as use of low carbon fuels and biofuels resources in advanced energy conversion for power and propulsion applications. It will also help to foster international research collaborations and research exchanges to promote diversity. The organizers will invite several leaders in the field from around the globe with a key focus on energy and the environment. It is expected that this workshop will result in several international collaborations on low carbon fuels production and utilization as the topic is of great interest to the international community participating at the workshop. In addition, it will provide rich educational experiences and pedagogical benefits to the students and researchers. A research monograph with chapters contributed by the invited speakers will be published.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
