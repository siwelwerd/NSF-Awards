 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Northeast Women in Algebra and Combinatorics Conference is celebrating 50 years since the founding of the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM); it will be held between April 28-30, 2023, at the State University of New York at Albany. The conference honors the achievements of AWM in advancing the cause of women in mathematics for the past 50 years. It will bring together an outstanding group of women speakers, the members of the Northeast algebra and combinatorics community, as well as participants from throughout the US and some international ones. The conference is also dedicated to the memory of Georgia Benkart, the plenary speaker at the conference's first edition, held virtually on November 20-21, 2021.\r\n\r\nThis conference presents an excellent opportunity for mathematicians located in the Northeast region and beyond to hear talks from renowned women in the fields of algebra and combinatorics. In addition to providing a platform for speakers to showcase and promote their research, the conference aims to create an inclusive environment that encourages collaborations and mentorship opportunities among participants. The talks will be delivered in a colloquium-style that is accessible to all, covering a wide range of topics in algebra and combinatorics. The conference will also include a poster session, as well as a problem session where attendees can present their research and engage in discussions about ongoing research challenges. Furthermore, there will be a panel discussion dedicated to Women in Mathematics. Social breaks will offer participants an opportunity to network with peers and expand their professional connections. Website: https://www.albany.edu/~sdc/AWM21/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The organizers were: Cristian Lenart (SUNY Albany), Laura Colmenarejo (North Carolina State University), Karin Reinhold (SUNY Albany), Lauren Rose (Bard College), Changlong Zhong (SUNY Albany), Seth Chaiken (SUNY Albany), and Antun Milas (SUNY Albany).</p>\n<p>The conference was in the memory of Georgia Benkart, who was the main speaker at the earlier online conference devoted to the AWM anniversary, which we organized on November 20-21, 2021. It focused on the recent advances in the fields of algebra, combinatorics, and related areas, on showcasing the work of junior researchers, as well as on providing an inclusive space that promotes collaboration, mentorships, and networking. We also got to celebrate the 50th anniversary of AWM, by highlighting its role and ongoing efforts toward its goals. The conference contributed to creating a sense of community among women in mathematics, and to strengthening the support for them from the broader mathematical community, particularly from the Northeast. The conference was also an opportunity to strengthen, expand, and increase diversity in the Northeast Combinatorics Network, and it had a positive impact on mathematics research and education at SUNY Albany.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The conference schedule featured 14 distinguished women plenary speakers, both senior and junior researchers, as well as 15 poster presenters, mostly junior researchers. The plenary speakers were: Katrina Barron (University of Notre Dame), Linda Chen (Swarthmore College), Laura Colmenarejo (North Carolina State University), Chiara Damiolini (University of Texas at Austin), Rebecca Goldin, (George Mason University), Seoyoung Kim (Georg-August Universit\"at G\"ottingen), Jennifer Morse (University of Virginia), Elizabeth Mili&#263;evi&#263; (Haverford College), Rosa Orellana (Dartmouth College), Colleen Robichaux (UCLA), Anne Schilling (University of California Davis), Julianna Tymoczko (Smith College), Anna Weigandt (MIT), and Weihong Xu (Virginia Tech). The conference also included: a tribute talk to Georgia Benkart (by Michael Lau, University of Laval, Canada), an AWM panel (moderated by Lauren Rose), as well as some social activities (coffee breaks, a conference dinner, and a walking tour of Albany).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The conference was attended by approximately 70 mathematicians. Most of the participants were from the Northeast, but we also had participants from other regions of the US, as well as Canada, Mexico, Germany, China, and Vietnam. The conference grant supported the travel of 33 non-local participants, of whom 23 were junior mathematicians.</p>\n<p>More information about the conference, including the detailed schedule, titles and abstracts of the talks and poster presentations, as well as the slides of some talks can be found on the conference website:</p>\n<p>https://www.albany.edu/~sdc/AWM21/</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 08/28/2024<br>\nModified by: Cristian&nbsp;P&nbsp;Lenart</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2305413/2305413_10860304_1724698212527_conf_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2305413/2305413_10860304_1724698212527_conf_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"AWM panel\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2305413/2305413_10860304_1724698212527_conf_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"AWM panel\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">AWM Panel</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Changlong Zhong</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Changlong&nbsp;Zhong\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">AWM panel</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2305413/2305413_10860304_1724698050166_conf_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2305413/2305413_10860304_1724698050166_conf_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Conference picture\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2305413/2305413_10860304_1724698050166_conf_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Conference picture\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Conference picture</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Changlong Zhong</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Changlong&nbsp;Zhong\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Conference picture</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2305413/2305413_10860304_1724698097709_conf_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2305413/2305413_10860304_1724698097709_conf_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Conference group photo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2305413/2305413_10860304_1724698097709_conf_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Conference group photo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Group photo</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Changlong Zhong</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Changlong&nbsp;Zhong\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Conference group photo</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2305413/2305413_10860304_1724698262626_2023_04_28_Association_for_Women_in_Math_4T9A8371--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2305413/2305413_10860304_1724698262626_2023_04_28_Association_for_Women_in_Math_4T9A8371--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Talk\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2305413/2305413_10860304_1724698262626_2023_04_28_Association_for_Women_in_Math_4T9A8371--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Talk\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Talk by Prof. Anne Schilling</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Changlong Zhong</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Changlong&nbsp;Zhong\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Talk</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
