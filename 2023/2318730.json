 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sustainability Hub project is a transformative initiative that consolidates sustainability and well-being data from across Colorado into a single platform. This initiative fosters collaboration among community members, policy makers, and researchers, empowering users from diverse backgrounds to engage with and draw conclusions from the data. By making this data accessible in one place, the Hub facilitates evidence-based decision-making, leading to improved community well-being, economic prosperity, and environmental sustainability. The Hub is not just another data platform; it is an integral part of a researcher\u2019s sharing pipeline for results, thereby promoting the progress of science. It moves beyond being a simple data warehouse, developing new connections between information in a process known as data democracy. For all users, this approach empowers them to \"own\" their data, maintain their information, contribute new research, and create new datasets, which in turn inform decisions affecting their well-being. For communities, the project is expected to enhance access to useful data and interactions, serving as a critical tool for the community's journey towards successful sustainability. The team believes that enhanced access to data and information about opportunities is critical to the promotion of just, equitable, diverse, and inclusive community development through education.\r\n\r\nThe Sustainability Hub project is a transformative initiative executed by several teams working in parallel with the primary goal of developing an application that consolidates a wide range of sustainability and well-being data into a single, universally accessible platform. This platform is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, enabling users from diverse backgrounds to engage with the data effectively. A standout feature of the platform will be its conversational interface, similar to a chatbot, powered by advanced machine-learning techniques, allowing users to interact with the platform in a natural, conversational manner. This innovative approach enhances user experience and engagement with the platform. In addition to the development of the application, the project will focus on the collection and organization of data, employing techniques such as keyword search and data linking to make the data more understandable and interconnected, allowing users to find and explore related data easily. A key aspect of the project is its community-driven approach, with the design and development of the Sustainability Hub heavily influenced by the needs and requirements of the community it serves. The project team will conduct listening sessions across the state to gather community insights, needs, and requirements, which will then be used to inform the development of the platform. The potential contribution of the Sustainability Hub project is significant. By facilitating evidence-based decision-making, the project has the potential to improve community well-being, promote economic prosperity, and advance environmental sustainability. By making sustainability and well-being data accessible and understandable, the Sustainability Hub project aims to empower communities to make informed decisions that contribute to their prosperity and welfare.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
