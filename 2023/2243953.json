 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU Site: Training in Emerging Biomedical Optics and Imaging Approaches hosted by the University of Arkansas aims to engage undergraduate students in scientific research under the mentorship of faculty in the Department of Biomedical Engineering. Recently, in the state of Arkansas and the surrounding region, there has been significant growth in students\u2019 interest in the field of biomedical engineering, but relatively limited opportunities for undergraduate research. Research experience allows students to apply their knowledge gained through the classroom, teaches them independent scientific research, develops hands-on skills, and prepares them for a career in science and engineering.  Students will be recruited from colleges and universities in the region that lack a biomedical engineering research program. The program is intended to teach students independent scientific research and guide undergraduate students\u2014those who would otherwise not have the mentorship opportunity\u2014to pursue a career in science and engineering and specifically, in the growing field of biomedical optics. Students will gain professional perspectives through a professional development seminar series, and engage in interdisciplinary professional development activities with other researchers on campus. The project will prepare undergraduate students from various backgrounds for graduate studies in biomedical engineering or a related field as well as career as scientists and engineers.  \r\n\r\nThe REU Site: Training in Emerging Biomedical Optics and Imaging Approaches at the University of Arkansas will provide scientific research opportunities for students in the region who lack such opportunities, teach students valuable hands-on research skills within the field of biomedical optics and imaging, and prepare students for an ethically grounded career in science and engineering. Recently, in the state of Arkansas and the surrounding region, there has been significant growth in the students\u2019 interest in the field of biomedical engineering, but relatively limited opportunities for undergraduate research. The site will provide both the financial and scholarly platform to bring together students who lack these opportunities, recruiting from colleges and universities of the surrounding areas that lack biomedical research programs.  In addition to rigorous coursework, undergraduate research is an integral part of the biomedical engineering undergraduate education.  Research experience allows students to apply their knowledge gained through the classroom, teaches them independent scientific research, develops hands-on skills, and prepares them for a career in science and engineering.  Students will be assigned independent hypothesis-driven projects in state-of-the-art biomedical research laboratories in fields of optical instrumentation development or basic science applying existing, cutting-edge optical imaging or spectroscopy methods. Students will learn to generate experimental hypotheses, design and carry out experiments, and analyze and communicate the results of their research.  Students will gain professional perspectives through a professional development seminar series, and engage in interdisciplinary professional development activities with other researchers on campus. The project will prepare undergraduate students from various backgrounds for graduate studies in biomedical engineering or a related field as well as career as scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
