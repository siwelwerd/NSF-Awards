 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the United States, the provision of safe and reliable water is often taken for granted. Water services in the U.S. and globally are under increasing strain and are failing many of the most vulnerable and underserved populations. Together, aging infrastructure, a shrinking water-sector workforce, increasing urbanization, and changing rainfall patterns increase stress on water services. There are rapidly increasing risks of safe drinking water shortages, a higher prevalence of water-related diseases, increased flooding, and the inadequate treatment of wastewater. An adequate response requires interdisciplinary teams of experts to collaborate with communities and government agencies to innovate appropriate solutions together. The project is initially focused on five related water challenges in the Southeast U.S. that epitomize situations elsewhere: water scarcity, water quality, aging infrastructure, flooding, and climate change. The approach to all five challenges is grounded in environmental justice with a vision to ensure all communities have equitable and reliable access to safe and affordable water with considerations in stormwater management and flood mitigation.\r\n\r\nThis project establishes the foundation of a research center that works to advance equitable and just water services, thus providing for a resilient future. In partnership with multiple actors, this project creates a shared vision for a center that addresses research, education, and training needs to respond to the urgent demands in the water sector. Collaborators include local and state government agencies, utility managers, community-based organizations, industry, and academic institutions. Through workshops, focus groups, and interviews, collaborators discuss values and experiences, service challenges and shortcomings, and identify data and workforce needs. This process leads to a holistic understanding of current water services provision, future visions, and the steps to get there. The research project builds regional capacity through strengthened regional networks for sharing and collaborating and creating innovative solutions that can be translated and scaled to other regions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
