 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electromagnetic waves with frequencies in the ultra-low frequency (ULF) range are known to be among the leading causes of radial diffusion and transport of energetic electrons in Earth's radiation belts.   The frequencies of ULF waves overlap with the range of drift frequencies of energetic electrons as they circle the Earth, leading to resonant interactions.  Numerous expressions have been derived to quantitatively describe radial diffusion so that they can be incorporated into global models of radiation belt electrons.  However, most expressions of the radial diffusion rates are derived only for equatorially mirroring electrons and are based on estimates of the power of ULF waves that are obtained either from spacecraft close to the equatorial plane or from the ground.  Recent studies using the Van Allen Probes and Arase have shown that the wave power in magnetic fluctuations is significantly enhanced away from the magnetic equator, consistent with models simulating the natural modes of oscillation of magnetospheric field lines.  This has significant implications for the estimation of radial diffusion rates, as higher pitch angle electrons will experience considerably higher ULF wave fluctuations than equatorial electrons.  This project will derive the magnetic and electric field wave powers and incorporate them into the 3D test particle simulations to estimate the diffusion coefficient.  The novel, pitch-angle-dependent diffusion rates will be introduced to a global model of radiation belt electrons to evaluate the effect of the pitch-angle dependence of the diffusion coefficient on radiation belt dynamics.  The result could have significant implications for the radial diffusion rates as currently estimated.  It will pave the way for incorporating pitch-angle-dependent radial diffusion coefficients in global models to predict the near-Earth radiation environment better.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this project is to quantify the role of off-equatorial Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) waves on the radial transport and diffusion of relativistic electrons (100s keV to few MeV) in the outer radiation belt (L~4 to 7), investigating the effect of pitch-angle-dependent radial transport of energetic particles on global dynamics of the radiation belts. The following science questions will be answered: How are ULF electric and magnetic field fluctuations distributed in magnetic latitude and magnetic local time under varying solar and geomagnetic conditions? What is the role of off-equatorial ULF wave fluctuations on the radial diffusion and transport of relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt (L~4 to 7)? How are off-equatorial ULF waves expected to impact current radiation belt models, and what is their contribution to the global dynamics of the radiation belts?  The team will use multiple satellite datasets (THEMIS, Van Allen Probes, Cluster, and Arase), test particle tracing simulations, and a global radiation belt model to quantify the contribution of off-equatorial ULF waves on radial diffusion in the radiation belts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
