 "awd_abstract_narration": "The eighth SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics) Central States Section Annual Meeting will be held on Oct. 7-8, 2023, on the campus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Since its foundation in 2014, the SIAM Central States Section (SIAM-CSS) serves SIAM members in eight central U.S. states: Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. The annual meeting, which attracts over 200 participants, aims to promote applied and computational mathematics by providing a platform for researchers and practitioners at all stages of their careers to exchange ideas and foster collaborations. The majority of the participants are members of the growing SIAM-CSS community, including faculty, postdoc researchers and graduate students from the 30 universities and 12 SIAM student chapters in the eight central states. In particular, the conference offers an opportunity for early career faculty members, postdocs, and graduate students to showcase their research results, exchange ideas with people from different disciplines, and gain experience to improve their skills in communication and presentation. The conference aims to invite, encourage, and support participation from researchers from historically underrepresented groups, and faculty from institutions where opportunities to attend major research conferences might be limited. Six out of the eight central states, including Nebraska, are EPSCoR states, and this conference will play an important role in stimulating research activities in applied and computational mathematics in these states.\r\n\r\nThe eighth SIAM-CSS Annual Meeting in Lincoln will provide an opportunity for researchers to facilitate a transfer of knowledge and exchange of ideas among specialists in applied mathematics, numerical analysis, scientific computing, and related applied fields. The conference\u2019s interdisciplinary nature will provide avenues for collaborations between researchers in the Central States region and beyond. In addition, the conference will particularly promote the participation of early career mathematicians from all over the U.S., thereby influencing the research interests and directions of those researchers attending the event. The conference website is located at https://math.unl.edu/siam-2023.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The 8th Annual Meeting of the SIAM Central States Section was held on the city campus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln from October 7-8, 2023. The event featured three plenary talks, 151 presentations across 18 mini-symposia, eight SIAM CSS Student Chapter research presentations, 15 contributed talks, and a poster session, attracting a total of 211 participants. A significant portion of the attendees were junior researchers, including undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and tenure-track faculty. This project supported 80 participants, including undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, early-career faculty members from institutions nationwide, with a focus on researchers from underrepresented minority groups and colleagues from four-year colleges.&nbsp;The conference provided ample networking opportunities, facilitating research collaborations and discussions among participants. As a result, the event offered an excellent platform for regional researchers at all career stages, especially benefiting young faculty members, postdocs, and graduate students. It allowed them to present their research, engage in interdisciplinary discussions, and enhance their communication and presentation skills.
