 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational Biology and Bioinformatics provide tools and methodologies, which fastens biological research across all biological scales. The 2023 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM2023) will provide a unique opportunity for multi- and interdisciplinary researchers in quantitative sciences, life sciences, and their interfaces to collaborate and share ideas interactively. The conference will cover six synergistic themes to facilitate the cross-fertilization of ideas, bridge knowledge gaps, and promote new research collaborations. As an effort to foster the growth of early-career researchers and students, providing them with travel awards, especially to those from underrepresented communities who may not otherwise have had the opportunity to participate, is crucial. At the heart of BIBM2023's commitment, the conference will promote scientific progress, advance diversity, and benefit society by supporting the attendance, presentation, and collaboration of the next generation of researchers.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this grant is to provide travel awards to the early-career researchers and students, especially those from underrepresented communities, who have registered to attend the BIBM2023. It selects a qualified cohort to receive the travel awards and distributes the fundings to support and cover their travel expenses. The methods and approaches to be used include advertising the travel award opportunity, reviewing applications, and selecting the awardees based on the criteria, financial need, and research merit. The grant will contribute significantly to the goal of fostering the next generation of researchers in the fields of Bioinformatics and Biomedicine by supporting their involvement with experts in the BIBM2023 and gaining experience and exposure in their areas, which would ultimately advance the progress of science, education, diversity, and societal benefits that reflect the NSF's mission. The conference website is \u201chttps://bidma.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/IEEE-BIBM-2023/\u201d.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
