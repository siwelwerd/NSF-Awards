 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this planning project aims to develop an immersive virtual engineering laboratory that caters to the needs of students with disabilities, providing them with a transformative learning experience within an inclusive framework. In STEM education, engineering focuses on design, problem-solving, and construction. Preparing students for engineering roles necessitates a balance between theoretical instruction and practical exploration. However, traditional engineering laboratories frequently overlook the specific needs of students with disabilities, limiting their active engagement and learning outcomes. This challenge is especially evident given the significant number of students with disabilities in the U.S., the distinct barriers they face in STEM education, and the notable presence of both Hispanic/Latinx students and those with disabilities at Florida International University (FIU). To address this challenge, the research team will collaborate with the Disability Resource Center, the Center for the Advancement of Teaching, and the Center for Diversity and Student Success at FIU to develop an immersive virtual engineering environment that caters to the needs of students with disabilities, providing them with a transformative learning experience within an inclusive framework. By incorporating digital twin models and extended reality (XR) technologies, the study aims to bridge the gap between current teaching pedagogy and student needs, ultimately enhancing educational accessibility and equity for students with disabilities. This project aims to overcome the common barriers faced by students with disabilities by creating an inclusive and immersive learning environment. This innovative fusion of technology holds the potential to significantly enhance the learning experience and outcomes of students with disabilities, enabling students with diverse backgrounds and learning needs to participate in their STEM education actively and effectively.\r\n\r\nThis project strives to provide actionable insights and solutions tailored to the needs of students with disabilities, aiming to enrich their academic experiences and boost their success in STEM education. By conducting surveys, ethnographic research, and interviews, the research team will delve into the unique needs and characteristics of students with disabilities in their STEM education experience. The creation of an inclusive virtual engineering laboratory, utilizing digital twin models combined with XR technologies, will redefine traditional learning methods, opening up novel avenues for student engagement. This technology-driven approach promises to transform the landscape of STEM education, empowering students with diverse learning needs to engage themselves actively and effectively in their engineering courses. The end goal is to champion inclusivity, elevate educational opportunities, and ensure academic achievements for students with disabilities. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
