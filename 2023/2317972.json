 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) is centered on the 2024 Total Solar Eclipse, which will traverse the US from southwest to the northeast, passing over several urban areas. The ASP\u2019s Eclipse Ambassadors Project will train 300 teachers and astronomers to facilitate activities in a solar eclipse kit to be developed as a part of this project. This project includes professional development for elementary and middle school teachers and scientists.  This project provides opportunities for students from groups underrepresented in STEM. This award is jointly supported by the Solar Terrestrial Research, the Discovery Research in K-12 (DRK-12), the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL), and the Astronomical Sciences Education and Special Programs.\r\n\r\nApproximately 200 Grade K-9 science teachers and 100 astronomers are estimated to engage with a minimum of 20,000 members of the public and an additional 10,000 school students. Upon acceptance to participate in workshops, approximately 200 Grade K-9 science teachers and 100 astronomers will receive the eclipse kits and 3 hours of online professional development. They will also receive permanent access to the Learn@ASP portal, which provides access to materials and other ambassadors, facilitating professional development beyond the eclipse.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
