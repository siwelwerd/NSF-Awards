 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make automated harvesting of strawberries more efficient and effective and hence, more financially viable for growers to adopt. Automated harvesters currently deployed in conventional strawberry farms cannot reliably handle peak-season conditions when strawberries are hidden below a thick plant canopy and where plants must be displaced to view and pick the fruit. This project will develop software to expand the set of conditions whereby automation can increase productivity. Strawberries, the second most popular fruit in the United States, have the highest cost per acre to harvest because of their high touch harvesting process. Automating the harvesting process reduces labor needs, with the potential to either decrease costs and / or increase the quality of the fruit. Further, the project is expected to create high-skill jobs for American workers. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project\u2019s main technical objective is to improve the quality and coverage of the map representation of strawberries and plants which will increase the number of harvested strawberries and the rate at which they are picked. The scope of the Phase I activity is to implement two software capabilities and to test them in simulation, laboratory and field environments. The first capability is a trajectory optimization module for a camera mounted to a robot manipulator. This technology will be designed to maximize information gain and to reduce localization uncertainty for strawberries while respecting kinematic and collision constraints for the motion of the robot arm. Success is to be measured by the rate of information gain relative to a na\u00efve precomputed scan. The second is a trained neural network which estimates the parameters that best define a manipulation task plan for displacing foliage to maximize strawberry visibility and access for subsequent picking. Training and inference will be done in an end-to-end fashion, allowing an estimate of the value of a given task plan from color and depth camera observations of the scene. This contrasts with a conventional pipeline which doesn\u2019t make the most of the rich latent representations possible with neural networks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

L5 Automation is pursuing an approach to automated strawberry harvesting that uses off-the-shelf hardware combined with custom software to deploy a solution that is compatible with conventional farm layouts and operational procedures. Our prototype harvester uses multiple robotic arms and several cameras to interact with the strawberry bed to move the foliage and find and pick the ripe strawberries. Our goal is to support the continued economic viability of American-grown specialty fruits and vegetables through the development and eventual commercialization of our technology, while simultaneously improving food quality, nutritional availability and transforming low-skill, low-wage positions into better-paying career opportunities, especially in agricultural regions.

An autonomous harvesting system needs to deal with the same challenges: foliage needs to be moved out of the way and various vantage points need to be collected to ensure that all the ripe berries on the bed can be found and picked. L5 Automation's research into perception-aware trajectory optimization sought improvements in the motion planning for a robotic arm equipped with a camera on the end effector (eye-on-hand). The goal was to identify poses of the arm which allow the camera to capture images from various perspectives to improve the software's knowledge of the volumetric occupancy of the scene including the positions of the plants and strawberries.
