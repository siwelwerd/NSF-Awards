 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a mature, market-ready approach for building targeted, readily synthesizable inhibitors of viral proteases. The technology will extend the discovery platform to new targets and disease indications and build a biochemical foundation for progressing preclinical programs to promising leads, starting with a potent lead candidate for treating COVID-19. The project seeks to generate new intellectual property that covers the discovery platform and promising small molecules, and it will support new opportunities to partner with pharmaceutical companies on antiviral therapeutics, which continue to be an important unmet medical need. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to expand and industrialize the company\u2019s recently demonstrated approach for using microbial systems to guide the discovery and assembly of protease inhibitors. The project focuses on COVID-19 and other viral diseases that lack effective treatments, exhibit significant epidemic potential, and/or remain relevant to U.S. biodefense. The research program may uncover inhibitors of a broad set of viral proteases and as it screens large libraries of biosynthetic pathways for targeted inhibitors. This solution complements the multi-part effort by developing a potent lead candidate for treating COVID-19 and a general workflow for the (bio)synthetic optimization of hits identified. Success in these tasks may stretch contemporary approaches to synthetic biology by applying them to the discovery and assembly of new biologically active compounds and may develop a supporting (bio)synthetic workflow\u2014one that that combines applied enzymology and synthetic chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nViral diseases remain a major threat to human health, and the speed at which viruses can mutate pose a challenge to the development of efficacious treatments. Many viruses, including COVID-19, require the enzymatic activity of a protease to effectively replicate in human cells and cause disease. Impeding protease activity is a well validated path to slow viral replication and improve human health. Indeed, one of the ingredients in Paxlovid, Nirmatrelvir, inhibits the activity of the COVID protease, 3ClPro. New systems that can be used to rapidly measure protease activity or develop new inhibitors can help counter the threat of viral pathogen evolution.\r\n\n\nDuring this phase II SBIR project, Think Bioscience expanded and ruggedized its microbial platform for high-throughput screens of viral protease inhibitors in bacteria. Our bacterial platform is versatile, cheap, fast, scalable, and does not require any infectious particles, thereby offering a means to rapidly and safely identify new viral inhibitor therapeutics. The platform expansion carried out in this project created a protocol to predict protease resistance to existing drugs by measuring the effects of every possible protease single mutation in one experiment. Within 2 weeks, this high-throughput mutational scan identified known clinical mutations that give rise to Paxlovid resistance as well as new mutations that have not previously been seen. This expanded capability can be used as a diagnostic for patients as well as identifying drug synergies. Platform ruggedization occurred through a suite of protocols and data analytics tools that generated highly reproducible data across a range of viral proteases. Our improved screen incorporates both exogenously added compounds as well as microbially produced products that can launch medicinal chemistry programs.\r\n\n\nThe broader impacts of this SBIR include new technologies that can be deployed in the face of emerging viral threats. The funding for this project has also enabled bacterial drug discovery and resistance mapping expansion into additional drug targets including kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors. Additionally, a cohort of scientists and undergraduates have been trained in synthetic biology with an eye towards applications in medicine and drug development.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MatthewJTraylor\n"
