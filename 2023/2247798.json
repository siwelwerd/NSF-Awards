 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanisms-B Program of the Chemistry Division, Michael Nippe and his students in the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University are targeting the synthesis and study of the magnetization and electron spin dynamics of several interesting classes of compounds with potential as molecular magnets. Identifying structure-function relationships of molecular spin manifolds is essential for the understanding of how spin dynamics can be controlled and tuned and will lead to new molecular platforms for quantum information science. Graduate students working on this project will become experts in synthetic chemistry as well as in magnetic and spectroscopic techniques that are needed to study the new molecules. The PI is particularly dedicated to increasing diversity in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) areas as well as an ambassador for laboratory safety and is a promoting and improving the departmental safety culture. The PI also advocates for career paths in the STEM areas and takes a leading role as regional coordinator in the national US Crystal Growing Competition. This active outreach program targets K-12 students and teachers across the country and provides first hands-on experience in crystal growth.\r\n\r\nUnder this award, the research team led by Michael Nippe at Texas A&M University aims to provide synthetic access to hitherto unknown spin manifolds and in so doing increase fundamental understanding of spin dynamics in organometallic superparamagnets. The program will study (1) high-performance single-molecule magnets (SMMs) based on novel strong field borolide complexes of 4f elements, (2) temperature and magnetic field dependence of heterometallic 4f metal complexes with strong 4f\u00b7\u00b7\u00b74f interactions and magnetically coupled ground states, and (3) electron spin coherence times of new organometallic platforms that exhibit spin frustration and toroidal magnetic ground states that can be coupled to electron spins of a rare earth ion. In terms of broader scientific impact, the molecular spin manifolds being developed in this project have potential for future application in quantum information technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
