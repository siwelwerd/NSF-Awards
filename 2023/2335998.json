 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Workshop on Sparse Tensor Computations will be held October 18-19, 2023, in Chicago, IL at the Discovery Partners Institute, a satellite location of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The workshop will consist of approximately 20 talks over one and a half days, and it will include a poster session. We expect to attract approximately 80 participants, mostly from the United States. The project will financially support 20-30 students or junior researchers from academic institutions in the United States to attend and present at the workshop.  In addition to providing broad dissemination of recent advances in sparse tensor computations, the workshop promotes vertical integration by emphasizing the contributions of young scientists.  The broad range of domains that develop and utilize sparse tensor computations is reflected in the attendees of the workshop, which will lure participants into exploring questions outside their immediate areas of interest. The Workshop on Sparse Tensor Computations will help society by promoting the careers of talented students and early career scientists, encouraging their future scientific pursuits and pushing the boundaries of computational problems that can be solved effectively and efficiently.\r\n\r\nTensors provide a data abstraction of high-order interactions and act as an interface between applications, mathematical models, and computation.  They have proved effective across a variety of application areas, including scientific computing domains and partial differential equation models, unsupervised machine learning problem involving multi-parameter observations, and many others.  Across a number of application domains as well as in fields of applied mathematics and computer science, research on tensor methods has been particularly active and continues to grow. The workshop is organized to facilitate transfer of ideas among researchers in tensor computations from various fields, including scientific and machine learning applications, algorithms, software, compilers, and architectures. Graduate students, postdoctoral researches, junior faculty, and senior faculty will present work to one another, attend talks together, and interact closely during a poster session.  The conference website is located at https://solomonik.cs.illinois.edu/tensor_workshop/index.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
