 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research synthesis systematically reviews and meta-analyzes the evidence on relationships between teacher support, student engagement, and mathematics achievement in the instructional\u2013relational model framework. The researchers rigorously examine the consistency and variability of the relationships between the domains and constructs across studies. The results of this comprehensive meta-analysis inform the research community on the status of student engagement research by identifying patterns of results among studies, identifying, and resolving sources of disagreement among results, supporting, or rejecting the generalization of primary evidence, and, consequently, contributing to the direct future research in the field.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator and her team estimate each correlation embedded within the instructional\u2013relational model. Specifically, they (a) meta-analyze the bivariate relationships among teacher support, student engagement, and mathematics achievement, (b) explore the variation or heterogeneity of the relationships with moderators representing student sample characteristics, (c) conduct a structural test of the model, where student engagement mediates the associations between teacher support and mathematics achievement, and (d) examine whether the mediational model varies for different engagement components and different classroom and student characteristics. Taken together the components of the research project provide an opportunity to better understand the nature of each relationship in the instructional\u2013relational model of mathematics classroom learning.\r\n\r\nThis research project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad, and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. The program supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
