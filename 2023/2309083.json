 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract: \r\nThe Center for Advanced Materials & Manufacturing (CAMM), a Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University of Tennessee (UT), Knoxville, focuses on the exploration, discovery, and design of new materials with properties of critical societal importance for energy, transport, and security advancements. CAMM brings together experts from diverse fields to make groundbreaking discoveries in two areas: (1) materials for future quantum technologies, and (2) advanced materials for extreme conditions. To tackle these challenges, CAMM utilizes the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) together with neutron scattering, materials synthesis, and modeling. Interdisciplinary research group (IRG) 1 is dedicated to accelerating the understanding, design, and control of quantum materials and systems through the use of AI with advances expected in the design of materials for energy harvesting, low-power electronics, quantum computing, and novel sensing applications. CAMM\u2019s second IRG focuses on developing materials that can withstand extreme temperatures and pressure needed for nuclear fusion and hypersonic defense systems.  These applications require high-performance structural materials not available today, and CAMM researchers are increasing the understanding of the structure, properties, and processing relationship to uncover new and enhanced materials with superior properties capable of performing in such harsh operating environments. At the core of CAMM is a culture of research, innovation, and learning. The center provides opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral trainees, to prepare for careers as researchers, entrepreneurs, and innovators in academia, industry, and national laboratories. These students gain the necessary skills and knowledge to engage in AI-enabled discovery and innovation. CAMM is committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion and works closely with minority serving institutions in the Southeast US to address the lack of diversity in STEM fields. CAMM offers mechanisms for collaborative research and technology translation as well as access to unique research resources and shared facilities in AI and extreme conditions making it an important center for advancing scientific knowledge and innovation in the country.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: \r\nThe Center for Advanced Materials & Manufacturing (CAMM) addresses two critical challenges: (1) how to overcome the complexity of quantum materials that currently hinders progress (interdisciplinary research group 1 (IRG1)); and (2) realizing structural materials capable of the extreme performance characteristics needed for future technologies (IRG2). IRG1 focuses on applying AI to quantum magnetic materials and engineered quantum systems supporting the rational design of materials with applications. It develops AI-based tools to handle complex quantum phases and physical behavior. IRG2 explores the effects of extreme conditions on stability, structure, and properties of high-performance structural materials, elucidating the materials paradigm for these novel systems. These materials are vital for a broad spectrum of energy, transport, and security applications. Four interrelated research methodologies \u2013 neutron scattering; modeling, simulations, and AI; in situ experiments; and materials co-design \u2013 connect the IRGs, with application and development of machine learning providing mathematical, analysis, and data science tools to find patterns in data and simulations and enable optimization and autonomous discovery. CAMM includes a tailored graduate education model and curriculum incorporating the use of AI in materials and manufacturing discovery, and a Research Experiences for Undergraduate program that exposes diverse cadres of undergraduate students to the joy of discovery and the wide-ranging career opportunities created by graduate education. It engages partners including Historically Black Colleges and Universities, to increase the number of underrepresented students participating in research experiences, education, entrepreneurship, and innovation. CAMM also leverages UT\u2019s strong corporate partnership program and engages East Tennessee\u2019s rich innovation ecosystem. Further, it leverages the unique strategic partnership of the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to strengthen collaborations among materials science and engineering communities. CAMM impacts the nation by making new experimental and AI capabilities available to researchers; training future researchers in next-generation approaches to quantum and extreme materials; and advancing the frontier of technologies from low power electronics and quantum sensors to nuclear fusion and hypersonic systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
