 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes the development and implementation of a robot for post-harvest grain management with the goal of reducing waste, increasing efficiency, and improving the overall sustainability of the agricultural sector. Post-harvest grain management is a crucial aspect of agriculture; However, it can also be a challenging and labor-intensive process for farmers. The incorporation of robots in this process has the potential to alleviate these difficulties and improve overall productivity. By reducing waste and increasing efficiency in grain storage and processing, farmers can ensure that a greater proportion of their crops are utilized, resulting in a more substantial yield. Additionally, the use of automation can enhance working conditions for farmers, allowing them to devote more time to other important tasks. The findings of this research have the potential to have a significant impact on national security, food security, and the rural economy.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses farmer/worker well-being with research and development on a grain bin management robot.  This robot has the potential to transform the field of post-harvest grain storage through its ability to autonomously perform novel and innovative tasks within granular bulk storage environments. Additionally, the robot's ability to safely and effectively operate in harsh, hazardous environments through the implementation of robust safety measures and the use of specialized, hardened electronics further demonstrates the significance of this technology in advancing the field of agricultural robotics. As this technology develops, the autonomous robot will change the way grain is stored. Advances from this research expand the focus from safety to the ability to do the work that no human could. The robot will positively impact labor issues, grain quality improvements, and workflow efficiencies throughout the grain-based supply chain.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
