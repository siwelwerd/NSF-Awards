 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Kansas Mathematics Graduate Student Conference (KMGSC) project will run biannual graduate student mathematics conferences alternating between the University of Kansas and Kansas State University, to be held in May and December of each year. Starting in the Fall of 2023, the conferences will expand to include graduate students from other universities in the region as well. These conferences will be organized by the graduate students under the guidance of faculty serving as mentors. This helps train students in project administration. KMGSC will provide a unique and valuable opportunity for graduate students to experience the benefits of presenting and taking part in a research conference.\r\n\r\nWith mostly graduate students and undergraduates in attendance, KMGSC provides a low-pressure environment in which graduate students can present their research and improve their presentation abilities. These conferences will help participants learn the current trends in multiple fields of research and provide an environment for interdisciplinary collaboration that can help build strong research groups. The networking possibilities and the experience gained from giving a research talk will greatly help the attendees mature as mathematicians and as future faculty members or professionals outside of academia. For more information, see https://mathematics.ku.edu/conferences\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
