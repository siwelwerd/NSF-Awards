 "awd_abstract_narration": "DNA molecules which pack together to form chromosomes, store the information for life, like a computer hard drive.  Genes are the bits of information, which are generally turned \u2018off\u2019 until the information is needed. A special protein called a transcription factor (TF) turns a gene \u2018on,\u2019 ultimately leading to protein production and cellular function.  Deciphering how TFs regulate gene expression is of fundamental importance to understanding their function in the development of a multicellular organism. This project will test the hypothesis that, much like dew drops on a spider web, the TFs form liquid-like droplets on the DNA where each droplet may provide a special environment that regulates gene expression. This project will provide key new knowledge in the field of gene regulation.  The education plan of the project aims to train the next generation of biophysicists by broadening the scope of underrepresented student participation in cross-disciplinary education and research, inspiring high-need urban high-school students from the Buffalo Public School District in STEM career options through accessible science and promoting biophysics literacy among lay audiences through local and global art exhibitions.\r\n\r\nGene expression is crucial for determining a cell\u2019s fate even though many genes that need to be expressed are rendered inaccessible by compaction into dense chromatin. Pioneer Transcription Factors (PTFs) can initiate chromatin remodeling into an accessible state. We hypothesize that this activity is facilitated by the formation of phase-separated hubs containing TFs, RNA polymerases, and protein complexes responsible for nucleosome remodeling. This project aims to determine the physical principles that govern the phase separation of PTFs and how the co-condensation of PTFs with DNA and other requisite cofactors regulates their activity. The proposed studies are expected to provide new insights into (a) the role of phase separation in genome organization, and (b) the mechanism of gene regulation by pioneer transcription factors. Synergistic educational, outreach and training activities complement the research and include engagement with undergraduate students, high school students and the lay public.  Completing the project goals will directly contribute to the PI\u2019s long-term research objective to uncover molecular mechanisms of genome organization via biomolecular phase transitions.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics and Genetic Mechanisms programs of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Biological Sciences Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
