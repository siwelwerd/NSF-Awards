 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics are materials composed of 2D crystal lattices with a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by the application of an external electric field. Harnessing the potential of 2D ferroelectric materials for electronic applications may lead to the development of memory and logic devices that surpass current technologies in energy efficiency and versatility. This project aims to identify new 2D ferroelectric materials, understand how to control and manipulate their properties, and explore the impact of their polarization on electrical conductivity. In addition to the research goals, the project also has a strong focus on education and outreach. The project involves both undergraduate and graduate students, while also providing opportunities for K-12 students and teachers to learn about nanotechnology. The broader aim of the project is to inspire and educate the next generation of scientists and engineers. By exposing students to cutting-edge Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) research, this project establishes a foundation for a variety of collaborative QISE activities in the future.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: Recent advancements in fabrication and characterization techniques have unveiled the potential for ferroelectric behavior in structures with reduced dimensionality. This project aims to understand the origin of ferroelectric ordering in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials and explore their polarization-coupled transport properties. The primary objectives of this research are to discover new 2D ferroelectric materials, understand the role of electrical and chemical boundary conditions in the emergence of ferroelectric ordering, and explore the physical mechanisms responsible for the polarization-coupled transport properties of these materials. The research employs a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical modeling. Experimental methods include advanced transport measurements as well as microscopic and spectroscopic techniques for structural characterization and nanoscale electrical testing to probe the polar and conducting behavior of the materials. These techniques provide essential data on the existence and nature of ferroelectric ordering in 2D van der Waals structures. Theoretical modeling involves first-principle calculations and symmetry-based considerations to gain insights into the physical mechanisms underlying the ferroelectric ordering and its coupling with electronic transport properties. This modeling guides the identification and characterization of new 2D ferroelectric materials and their potential applications. The outcomes of this research hold significant implications for both fundamental science and technological advancements, particularly in the development of multifunctional scalable structures for non-volatile memory and logic devices. By shedding light on the unique properties of 2D ferroelectric materials, this project contributes to the exploration of novel materials for future electronic devices.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by The Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (MPS/OMA), the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and Technology Frontiers Program (TIP/TF).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
