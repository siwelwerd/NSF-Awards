 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Mathematical Analysis and Applications, an eight week summer research program at the University of Michigan Dearborn. The program will host eight undergraduate students per year from diverse backgrounds. The primary objective of the program is to contribute to the research infrastructure by recruiting and training the next generation of U.S.-based mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThis undergraduate research program brings together eight undergraduate students and five faculty members each summer to collaborate on research projects in various branches of mathematics. Over the course of three summers, research projects will originate from the subjects of complex analysis, real analysis, harmonic analysis, stochastic analysis, probability theory, algebraic geometry, and inverse problems. REU participants will experiment, conjecture, provide rigorous solutions, and present results in different formats. In addition, participants will learn about the graduate school application process and career opportunities in both academia and industry. The program aims to recruit students from diverse backgrounds, including students from underrepresented groups, women, and first-generation college students. Finally, the program will connect participants with an extensive network of mentors and peers, thereby assisting them with career planning and fostering long-term engagement with the scientific community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
