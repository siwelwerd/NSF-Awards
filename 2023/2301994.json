The main objectives of the activity are to improve our understanding of recent significant developments in the field of Differential Geometry and Integrable Systems, bring together mathematicians from different backgrounds and in various career stages to foster mutual understanding and lay out foundations for future collaborative research and advance engagement of diverse graduate students and early-career researchers, particularly from underrepresented groups.   \r\n\r\nThe topics presented and discussed in this symposium span geometric flows, the connection between geometry and topology, geometric modeling and PDEs, and integrable systems. The inter-connection between these closely related subfields creates a framework in which advancement in one will collaterally lead to proportional boosts to others. The workshop-style event and participant diversity provide ample opportunities for interested students and researchers alike to find access points. The resulting interactions and discussions will lay the groundwork for future research by identifying important open questions and potential techniques to solve them. \r\n\r\nFor more information regarding the line-up of invited speakers and the program, please visit the website of the conference: https://www.math.ttu.edu/conferences/rr2023/index.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
