 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description:\r\nThis project brings together a team of scientists in physics, chemistry, materials science, and electrical engineering at the University of Michigan and the University of Minnesota to co-design electronic materials and devices based on oxides of the elements tin and germanium. It answers fundamental scientific questions to understand how these materials can be grown with sufficiently high quality and how their electrical conductivity can be controlled by modifications to their composition. The project has the potential to transform the development of fast, compact, and energy-efficient electronic devices manufactured with non-toxic elements, to catalyze applications such as electric vehicles and smart electricity grids, and to stimulate economic growth in the US. The principal investigators promote diversity and expand graduate education opportunities through initiatives such as developing curricula, mentoring undergraduate and PhD students, hosting summer schools, and collaborating with programs that support undergraduate research.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThis project supports research activities on the co-design of ultra-wide-band-gap semiconductor materials and electronic devices based on alloys of germanium dioxide with tin dioxide in the rutile structure. The research activities combine theory, thin-film growth, structural and electrical characterization, and device fabrication, and focus on (1) the development of high-quality thin films, (2) the demonstration of n-type and p-type doping, (3) the development of high-quality electrical contacts, (4) the understanding of low- and high- field electrical transport, and (5) the fabrication of prototype power devices. The research aims to advance the science and engineering of oxide semiconductor materials in order to co-design prototype devices and accelerate the manufacturing of energy-efficient electronics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
