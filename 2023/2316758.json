 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to support about 12 promising graduate students to participate in a two-day Doctoral Research Symposium to be held on Oct 14-15, 2023 in conjunction with the ACM 2023 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing (CSCW) in Minneapolis, MN.  CSCW is the premier international forum for research investigating the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks.  CSCW research spans a wide range of work, civic, and everyday life activities, as well as a wide range of computing technologies and academic disciplines.  The CSCW doctoral consortia, which began in 1992, serve to bring together students and mentors across the wide range of topics, devices, institutions, and disciplines the CSCW community encompasses, providing an important place for exchange of ideas in the broader community.  These events have long helped young doctoral scholars both refine their research and advance their professional development within the CSCW community under the guidance of experienced mentors in the field.  \r\n\r\nGoals of the doctoral consortium include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field mentor them and provide constructive advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference. Students will give brief presentations about their research, followed by discussion and constructive feedback both from members of the faculty panel and other student participants. The feedback will be geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other CSCW research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Mentors will discuss different aspects of research the research profession, including career paths, funding, work-life balance, and related topics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Professors Rosa Arriaga and Susan Wyche co-organized this year&rsquo;s event. The DC was held on October 15 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, as part of the ACM 2023 <em><a href=\"https://cscw.acm.org/2023/\">Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing</a></em> in Minneapolis, MN. The goal of the DC was to provide a forum for promising PhD students to present their research and receive constructive feedback. Community building was another significant goal.</p>\n<p>We started planning the DC in January 2023, by recruiting mentors to review students&rsquo; applications and developing the <a href=\"https://cscw.acm.org/2023/index.php/submit-dc/\">call for participation (CFP).</a> To solicit a broader pool of potential mentors, we created a lightweight application process (see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdx-Vjrw2QNwwkqrsFFy946TcwBWVl9SVNHbUaneQSpZtthlQ/viewform?usp=sharing\">Google survey</a>). We publicized the call for mentors using social media and email listservs. 17 scholars from academia and industry applied. Applicants represented a diverse range of career levels, institutions and departments. We invited all to participate in the event. Each mentor reviewed at least three students&rsquo; applications <a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a>; 12 also attended the session.</p>\n<p>In March 2023, we distributed the student <a href=\"https://cscw.acm.org/2023/index.php/submit-dc/\">call for participation</a> via social media and email. We also contacted faculty at universities with smaller and/or newly formed CSCW-related graduate programs, and faculty at HBCUs and Hispanic Serving Institutions that have CSCW research programs.</p>\n<p>To be considered for the workshop, PhD students submitted: a 4&ndash;6-page research overview, a CV, and a letter of support from their advisor. We received 43applicants from a broad range of disciplines that inform CSCW.&nbsp; Mentors used this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCzwg1txYLdeSj3LSFzqNIgr7Oz1M3dq4VaVNd9DgLjxA-Og/viewform?usp=sf_link\">Google form </a>&nbsp;to prepare their reviews. They were asked to evaluate applications using these criteria: <strong>Research Motivation</strong>; &nbsp;<strong>Relevance to CSCW</strong>; <strong>Presentation Clarity; Stage in PhD Program</strong>; and <strong>Community Engagement</strong>.</p>\n<p>Mentors were given 3 weeks to complete their reviews. Each application was reviewed by 2 mentors. We relied on these reviews, and our assessments of applicants&rsquo; materials to decide who to accept/reject. Preference was given to students with a clearly defined research topic aligned with the interests of the CSCW research community. We also prioritized students who had defended their dissertations proposals, were within one-two years of graduating, and would benefit most from receiving feedback from CSCW scholars. We accepted 14/43 students (32% acceptance rate).</p>\n<p>Prior to the DC&nbsp; students, mentors and the DC co-chairs attended an ACM-funded &ldquo;Welcome Dinner.\" Students and mentors introduced themselves at the event. The following morning&nbsp; the workshop began (see schedule). We began the workshop by discussing our goals and providing students with guidance on how to give an &ldquo;elevator pitch,&rdquo; and to be an &ldquo;active listener.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Prior to the workshop, we grouped the students into four groups based on their research topics: <strong>Online Information Curation</strong>;<strong>Computational Journalism</strong> and <strong>Information Dissemination</strong>; <strong>Intelligent Systems</strong>; and <strong>Health and Wellness</strong>. Each group was assigned three mentors. Students gave 15-minute presentations. Mentors had five minutes to provide feedback. Towards the end of the DC, mentors answered this question, &ldquo;What is something you know now, that you wish you knew as a PhD student?&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluation</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the workshop as <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qBdfOD2WFYCp50ZLm-2QrhWR0cq7ksjf9FWJ8F44oqE/edit\">survey</a> was sent to participants; 10 responded. Feedback was positive; students reported increasing their knowledge of CSCW topics and that they were satisfied with the workshop.</p>\n<p>This anwer was representative of those in response to this question, &ldquo;Where your expectations met for DC participation?</p>\n<p><em>Yes, the expectations where met. I was surprised that none did work similar to mine, but instead I got insights into the diverse research that are conducted within CSCW.</em></p>\n<p>However, students&rsquo; comments also suggested that they wanted more opportunities to interact with mentors.</p>\n<p>Future DC organizers might consider creating more informal opportunities for students and mentors to interact.
