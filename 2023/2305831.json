 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2023, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment, and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This project will study where energy is used as an organ grows and develops. This will be accomplished by imaging the energy in growing organs and then using physics to predict the growth and development of that organ, thus establishing a \u201cRule of life.\u201d Such a rule could have far-reaching implications for studying organs, and this work will provide a new perspective for understanding organ development. The organ this study focuses on will be the lung. Broader impacts will include outreach to young scientists through an annual 8 week summer program through Princeton University (The Princeton Learning Laboratory) designed for high school students, as well as training of undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nThis project explores the hypothesis that the physical forces driving tissue development are proportional to the local rate of energy production. Measurements in early embryonic chicken and mouse lung explants will connect patterns of chemical-energy turnover to mesoscopic tissue morphogenesis. The project will (1) use fluorescence microscopy of lung explants to measure spatial variations of energy metabolism, (2) measure the mechanical properties of the tissue layers in the lung explants, and (3) model the growth of the lung from the perspective of active matter physics, with a driving force locally proportional to the rate of energy production. The embryonic lung was chosen as a model organ because the morphology is distinct and stereotyped within a species, easily imaged in real-time, and prior work has characterized the morphogenesis of lung explants. Lungs collected from chicken eggs will make this research easily accessible for young scientists. Training programs incorporated into this project include a high school student summer program and subprojects for university students. These experiments and models will be some of the first work toward understanding energetics in organogenesis. The spatial quantification of energy metabolism and material properties generated by this work will provide a testbed for physical theories that relate cellular energetics to tissue generation from the molecular level, up the hierarchical structure of the developing lung, to the whole-organ scale.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
