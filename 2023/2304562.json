 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of software that calculates heart rate and variability statistics from traditional phone calls, without the need for patients to possess or install any software or hardware.  The proposed technology may be used to assess the severity of illnesses remotely and route patients to the appropriate care facility.  Industry experts estimate that more than 30% of all emergency admissions are unnecessary and could be reduced by better and easier to access remote physiological monitoring systems.  A record of heart rate and heart rate variability using real-time telemetry may help to effectively triage and proactively manage patient conditions before they are escalated to emergency rooms. In addition, the proposed technology may be a step towards bridging socioeconomic gaps and advancing healthcare equity.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a deviceless software that will allow clinicians to assess and monitor patients\u2019 current status from conventional phone calls. The proposed technology adds an additional layer to existing phone calls that uses voice input to capture vital signs such as heart rate and heart rate variability, sharing them with a clinician in real-time. The proposed technology is designed to allow an outpatient to call a hotline where the software is used to analyze vitals prior to speaking with a clinician and be routed accordingly, i.e., Emergency Room, Urgent Care, or in-home treatment. In addition, the proposed technology may be used for post-hospital event monitoring purposes where the patient receives a daily phone call to record vitals and answer a series of questions for doctors to review weekly as part of current physiological status assessment. With a 92% accuracy level, the proposed technology promises a streamlined method for clinicians to track vitals and manage health conditions at home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
