 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by seeking an optimal trade-off between synchronous and asynchronous instructional delivery methods resulting in a balanced approach that could potentially enable learners with different needs and learning paces to learn more effectively. The research project aims to address common educational challenges caused by students having disparate backgrounds and content acquisition rates. By providing students with the benefits of a live class (e.g. real-time discussions and learning from each other's questions) as well as the benefits of watching a video on their own (e.g. pause, speed up, rewind), different learning needs can be accommodated. The approach is particularly relevant to introductory and continuing education courses that include students having highly contrasted levels of background knowledge and preparation.\r\n\r\nPre-recorded lecture videos that feature a repository of previously asked questions are made available to students, additionally, an interactive dialogue module is used to connect directly with the instructor in real-time. The approach will be evaluated at two universities and in two different course types (traditional lecture and flipped classroom) in senior and graduate level courses in Haptics and Controls. Data will be collected on student utilization, performance, engagement, understanding and learning efficiency. Mechanisms to be used for data collection include website access logs, surveys, and performance in the class. Surveys and student focus group interviews will be employed to understand how students perceive the learning environment. Also, course instructors will be interviewed to understand how they are incorporating the approach into their courses. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
