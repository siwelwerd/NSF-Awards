 "awd_abstract_narration": "Radiation is an important discipline in the field of heat transfer and impacts a range of fields including solar-renewable energy, thermal management in space, global warming and high temperature microelectronics as examples. The award will cover travel expenses of ten graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, and five junior faculty members from institutions in the United States to travel and participate in the conference entitled, \"10th International Symposium on Radiative Transfer (RAD-23), Thessaloniki, Greece,\" which will be held during 12-16 June 2023. This is a prominent radiation conference/symposium and is well-attended by radiation researchers from across the world. The attendees will be supported in-full or in-part, and the organizers will make a concerted effort to select these participants from underrepresented groups in the interest of broadening participation. The participants will actively participate in the conference via paper presentations or organizing sessions. They will provide a short report on the impact of the conference participation on their professional development. \r\n\r\nThe chief intellectual merit of this conference lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of frontier and emerging research, and exposure to a diverse array of topics in the field of radiative heat transfer. The conference will be attended by both leading and young scientists in radiation from around the world, who will discuss present and future directions of research and research challenges. The conference will foster cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers in cutting edge areas of radiation and will address challenges involved in advancing the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
