 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods (CTMC) program in the Division of Chemistry,  Professor Krzysztof Szalewicz of University of Delaware will perform quantum-mechanical investigations of clusters of molecules, molecular condensed phases, and biomolecular systems. The properties of such systems are governed by intermolecular (van der Waals) forces: depending on the distance between two molecules, they will either attract or repel each other, a physical law that Richard Feynman considered to be the biggest finding of humanity. Szalewicz and coworkers have developed methods for computing intermolecular forces that are not only among the most accurate and computationally efficient ones, but also provide researchers with a unique ability to interpret properties dependent on intermolecular forces in terms of the four fundamental physical mechanisms: the electrostatic, exchange-repulsion, polarization, and dispersion interactions. Since direct quantum-mechanical calculations are limited to molecular assemblies with a hundred or so atoms, Szalewicz\u2019s group will develop machine learning methods of extrapolating quantum results to condensed phases. The importance of this work stems from its ability to predict properties of matter from first principles, i.e., deriving them from equations of quantum mechanics, for arbitrary molecular materials. One example would be the reliable predictions of crystal structures. Computational design of crystals is of significant importance for pharmaceutical, agrochemical, semiconductor, and energetic materials industries. This research in the Szalewicz group is expected to have broad scientific impact on fields ranging from materials, biomolecular, and atmospheric science to metrology, molecular spectroscopy and scattering, and astrophysics.  Broader impacts of this research will  include training of graduate students and postdoctoral associates with diverse backgrounds, extensive collaborations with other research groups, organization of conferences and workshops to disseminate knowledge, and in making developed software available for use by other researchers.\r\n\r\nThe methods that the Szalewicz group will develop under this award utilize symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) based on monomers described by density-functional theory (DFT), an approach denoted as SAPT(DFT). Machine-learning methods for the generation of force fields derived from SAPT(DFT) calculations will be extended to enable treatment of molecules with soft internal degrees of freedom. These force fields will be used for several systems of current experimental, observational, or technological interest, in particular for predictions of crystal structures from first principles, including difficult cases with polymorphism related to varying conformations of monomers. Other developments of theory will include work on improved DFT methods that can be paired with accurate dispersion energies and extensions of machine-learning force-field generation methods to three-body nonadditive interactions. There is potential for scientific broader impact in better understanding intermolecular interactions, in significantly advancing electronic structure methods and force-field development techniques, and in crystal structure predictions. It is expected that, in general, these studies will contribute to a better physical understanding of the properties of molecular materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
