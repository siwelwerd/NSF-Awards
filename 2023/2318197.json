 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded by contributions from Condensed Matter and Materials Theory program of the Division of Materials Research and the Chemical Theory, Models, and Computational Methods program of the Division of Chemistry. \r\n\r\nThis award supports participation of students in the Third US School and Workshop on Theory and Applications of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT), which will take place at Rutgers University-Newark from June 29, 2023 to July 8, 2023. TDDFT is an efficient and formally exact way of describing the dynamics of interacting many-body systems, and has become the method of choice for calculating excitation energies and optical properties of complex molecules and a broad range of materials. The school, which will be held during the first week, will involve the participation of 35 students and 8 instructors. Students will learn the fundamentals of TDDFT via theory lectures and gain hands-on experience by learning to use state-of-the-art TDDFT codes. The workshop to be held during the second week will involve invited presentations on cutting edge developments and applications of TDDFT from some of the leaders in the field as well as junior scientists. The conference will allow students to learn about the foundations and applications of TDDFT from experts in the field, facilitate the exchange of ideas between junior and senior researchers, and serve as an opportunity for creating new collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
