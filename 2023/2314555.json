 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation project examines how children\u2019s language abilities and experiences impact their production and comprehension of speech disfluencies. Speech disfluencies, including fillers 'uh' and 'um', are common in spontaneous language production and reliably precede difficult-to-retrieve words (e.g., words that are low-frequency or new to a conversation). Adults harness this association between fillers and production difficulty to anticipate upcoming novelty, but the mechanisms underlying children\u2019s production and comprehension of fillers are poorly understood. This is particularly so for children who have Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) and/or are exposed to more than one language (bilingual children). The overarching goal of this proposal is to examine both production and comprehension of fillers in children with a range of language skills and experiences. \r\n\r\nThe researchers measure children\u2019s production of fillers in natural speech as well as measure their ability to understand disfluency in a listening task. Monolingual and bilingual school-aged children representing a full range of language ability (from DLD to typical language (TD)) participate in the studies. Across multiple studies, the researchers measure filler production in natural speech, manipulating task demands to elucidate the consequences for disfluency and investigate filler comprehension by monitoring children\u2019s eye gaze during a listening task. Effects of language ability (TD vs. DLD) and bilingualism are examined continuously, through core language scores and years of language exposure. The project examines the factors that support filler use and comprehension, and it has implications for how speech practitioners measure and use disfluencies within clinical settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
