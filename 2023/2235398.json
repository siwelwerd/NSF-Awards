 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crossbar Array-based Processing-in-Memory (CBA-PIM) technology can be integrated in 3D with domain-specific heterogeneous compute-engines to achieve unprecedented improvements in application performance and power consumption. This FuSe-Teaming Grant will establish a collaboration between researchers at UC Riverside (UCR), Arizona State University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Washington State University. A pilot research project will define domain-specific CBA-PIM accelerators for streaming time series data analytics algorithms, integrate state-of-the-art techniques to achieve fault tolerance and reliability, and advance the state-of-the-art in monolithic 3D layout tools to ensure that the proposed devices can be physically realized. An Education and Workforce Development Plan will provide a comprehensive learning experience for graduate and undergraduate student trainees through which they will learn to design, layout, characterize, and program crossbar arrays, through which they will be exposed to a variety of open-source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools and crossbar simulators. It will also provide trainees with Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) competencies that will prepare them for employment working with future semiconductor technologies.\r\n\r\nMoore\u2019s Law has characterized miniaturization in semiconductor microelectronic systems for decades. With the slowing and inevitable end of Moore\u2019s Law on the horizon, advances in general-purpose computing technology can no longer sustain semiconductor industry growth. Subsequent advances are projected to occur through application-specific specialization that synergistically exploits future semiconductor technologies. By exposing trainees to these challenges and empowering them to explore potential solutions, the proposed activities will contribute to the development of the skilled technical workforce. The project leads plan to recruit trainees from underrepresented backgrounds to participate in the project; UCR is a Hispanic Serving Institution (OPEID-00131600). Research and education-related materials will be disseminated via a public-facing website dedicated to the project, and research outcomes will be integrated into a graduate course taught at UCR. This material will be also shared with the other project participants and with the general public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
