 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made for support of core activities conducted by the Board on Life Sciences (BLS) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies).  The BLS works to address technical, policy, and societal issues associated with basic, fundamental, and emerging life science and biotechnology research and their applications. With support from this award, BLS will: advance knowledge about scientific developments and associated policy and societal issues to address challenges before they arise or to further advance particular scientific areas; broaden participation of scientists from a diversity of backgrounds; and provide scientific and science policy advice to the U.S. government. BLS actively seeks to include scientists and reaches audiences across a diversity of backgrounds, experiences, disciplines, and sectors to contribute to and/or learn about the outcomes of projects. BLS conducts projects that have significant influence and impact beyond the initial goals of our projects, including the development of new policies governing life sciences research and new scientific initiatives to address identified knowledge and technological gaps. Since establishment in 1984, BLS has conducted numerous studies, workshops, and other activities to advance life sciences and biotechnology research toward addressing scientific and societal (e.g., health, environment, agriculture, economy, and national security) needs. BLS products have inspired others in the broader scientific and policy networks to act on suggestions and consensus recommendations produced from our projects. Similarly, efforts to foster cross-disciplinary research that drive innovation and new research opportunities in biology and identify education and training needs to support this innovation are addressed in BLS projects.\r\n\r\nBLS strives to provide the best possible scientific expertise to addressing contemporary and future challenges affecting the life sciences research enterprise and/or caused by advances in life sciences research. To achieve this goal, BLS efforts will focus on three objectives to: a) anticipate emerging scientific, policy, and societal issues associated with advances and applications in the life sciences; b) develop project concepts to address critical, emerging issues identified; and c) disseminate project outcomes to key audiences who play roles in addressing issues. BLS core activities to achieve these objectives include: semi-annual board meetings; concept analysis and scoping meetings; engagement with scientists to learn about outcomes from completed activities; and opportunity creation for scientists who are from marginalized and/or underrepresented groups to contribute to BLS activities. More detailed information about BLS and its work can be found at: www.nationalacademies.org/bls/board-on-life-sciences\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
