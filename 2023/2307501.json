 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to develop a new tool for astronomers to study the spectrum of light from objects in space.  Spectroscopy allows scientists to determine characteristics of an object -- such as temperature, distance, and motion -- and potentially to discover distant exoplanets.  Current technology uses fiber optic cables to feed light into spectrographs. Existing spectrographs are large, complicated instruments.  The principal investigator will develop new technology that will make spectrographs can be smaller, more efficient, and less costly. He will also explore using a special surface treatment on the lenses to reduce unwanted reflections.  These technological advancements will benefit not only astronomy, but also and other applications of spectroscopy. The community outreach initiatives will engage students and promote STEM activities related to the project's objectives.\r\n\r\nThis study will advance a concept for separating the wavelength channels of a spectrograph into simpler and smaller spectrographs that would allow more compact instruments.  This is useful for massively multiplexed spectroscopic facilities, where the number of spectrographs is quite large and space to locate the spectrographs limited.  Such wavelength splitting in a pre-optics module rather than in the spectrograph reduces the size and risk associated with wavelength beam splitters.  It also allows for locating blue channels closer to the telescope to significantly improve the transmitted light shortward of 500 nm.  Additionally, the study will explore the use of nanostructures for antireflection purposes and investigate mass production techniques for future scalability. These units also allow the implementation of pupil slicing, which can further simplify spectrograph complexity.  The project's intellectual merit lies in advancing the design aspects of wavelength splitting and pupil slicing, benefiting the field of astronomical spectroscopy and other spectroscopic applications. Furthermore, community outreach initiatives will engage students and promote STEM activities related to the project's objectives.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Division of Astronomical Sciences in MPS and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
