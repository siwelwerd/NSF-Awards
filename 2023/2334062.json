 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 23rd ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM will be held in Montreal, Canada October 24\u201326, 2023.  This grant will help 10 - 15 US-based graduate students to participate in the conference to disseminate their research outcomes, connect them with other researchers, and train them as the next generation of scholars. The Internet Measurement Conference is the premier international conference in the area of Internet measurement.  Attending the conference will help them pursue research in the field.  These travel grants will serve to widen the audience attending the Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), raising the level of interaction and the potential for new collaboration, new investigations, and higher quality research. Given the rising cost of travel, the grant will enable students, who otherwise do not have sufficient funds, to attend the conference.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will increase the dissemination of the conference's research results to a larger and more diverse audience. Moreover, IMC has a strong track record of giving preference in grant awards to women and minority students. To encourage researchers from under-represented groups to get involved with Internet measurement research, in the selection process, under-represented groups or institutions will be considered the most important factor. Advertising to a wide range of colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of institutions should also be able to attend and benefit from the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
