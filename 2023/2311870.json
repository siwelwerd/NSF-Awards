 "awd_abstract_narration": "Privacy Preserving Computations (PPC) that utilize Homomorphic Encryption (HE) to perform \r\ncomputations on encrypted data directly have become attractive recently. HE based Machine Learning (HE \r\nML) inference enables preservation of privacy in a wide variety of application domains that range from \r\nhealthcare, financial transactions, edge cyber physical systems, etc. Privacy sensitive applications that rely \r\non processing in a public cloud or data center can use HE ML inference to preserve privacy. While HE ML \r\ninference offers strong privacy guarantees, computations on encrypted data are orders of magnitude slower \r\nthan unencrypted computations and require significant hardware resources to make them attractive for end \r\nusers. Emerging data centers and cloud platforms are augmented with Field Programmable Gate Arrays \r\n(FPGAs). With the fine grained programmable architecture of FPGAs, these platforms are well suited for \r\naccelerating HE ML.\r\n\r\nThis work will leverage novel algorithmic, architectural and memory optimizations on FPGAs to develop a \r\nportable and configurable library to enable secure, resilient, and trustworthy cyberinfrastructure for end-to-\r\nend privacy sensitive ML inference. The library will provide FPGA accelerated Intellectual Property (IP) \r\ncores for HE kernels (L1 Library) as well as a FPGA Application Specific Processor (ASP) for inference of \r\nwidely studied HE ML models (L2 Library). The library will support various HE schemes, security levels, \r\nmachine learning models and FPGA platforms. It will include several software and hardware innovations \r\nalong with various HE specific optimizations such as efficient data layout, memory efficient scheduling and \r\nscalable interconnect to maximize memory utilization and to improve data reuse using on-chip memory. \r\nUsing the IP cores in the L1 Library, this project will compose a FPGA ASP with a domain-specific \r\nInstruction Set Architecture (ISA) and a compiler. The FPGA accelerator can be programmed in software to \r\nrealize real-time HE ML computations. The library will be released to the Computer & Information Science \r\n& Engineering (CISE) communities, including Machine Learning, Software, and Data Science communities, \r\nto accelerate the adoption of homomorphic encryption for privacy preserving computations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
