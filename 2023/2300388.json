 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0, refers to the manufacturing industry\u2019s use of technologies, such as artificial intelligence and advanced robotics, that allow machines to communicate with each other and work together to analyze and diagnose issues with increasingly minimal need for traditional human intervention. However, there is a growing national need for technicians who are prepared to work in new ways and with new skills in this modern technological industrial environment. The goal of this project is to create an academic program that will provide students with pathways to pursue AAS degrees while working in the automation industry. The resulting program will be designed to accommodate the needs of nontraditional and female students. The project will help to sustain the Nation\u2019s competitiveness in a manufacturing industry that is becoming increasingly automated and integrated with smart technology.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project include developing new courses and stackable certificate pathways, increasing the availability of Automation Robotics Engineering Technology (ARET)/Mechatronics education and training by using mobile training equipment, and increasing outreach and supports including apprenticeship opportunities. Curriculum modification will be completed in consultation with industry to ensure the program\u2019s education and training reflect advances in technology and modern workforce needs. The project\u2019s evaluation plan will examine the impact apprenticeship participation has on student retention and completion, addressing a knowledge gap around the outcomes of community college students\u2019 work-based learning experiences. The project will advance the knowledge and understanding of the competencies required to prepare technicians to meet Industry 4.0 standards and the processes necessary to align curriculum to Industry 4.0 standards. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
