 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU Site: Semiconductor Hands-On Research Experience (SHORE) at the University of Michigan seeks to address this workforce need by providing 10-week summer experiential training in nanofabrication of semiconductor materials, devices, and related technologies to cohorts of students. Semiconductor technology is critical to all facets of modern society. From day-to-day consumer activities to state-of-the-art defense needs, the U.S. relies on vigorous innovation, continuous performance improvement, and reliable manufacturing of microelectronics. Expanded domestic production and growth of an expanded and inclusive workforce in this field is urgently needed. To expand the diversity of the semiconductor workforce, the Site will recruit participants in partnership with  institutions with limited nanofabrication capabilities. Each year, nine REU students will be recruited to participate in 10-week summer research projects. The REU projects, which will include projects designed alongside faculty partners, will focus on research enabled by the Lurie Nanofabrication Facility. In this way, the REU site will provide opportunities for participants to engage in semiconductor-related research at an experiential level not available at their home institutions, to expand participation of scientists and engineers who are engaged in semiconductor-related engineering, and to facilitate their path to pursue STEM careers and further graduate studies in the field.\r\n\r\nThis three-year REU Site: Semiconductor Hands-On Research Experience (SHORE) at the University of Michigan seeks to address this workforce need by providing 10-week summer experiential training in nanofabrication of semiconductor materials, devices, and related technologies to cohorts of students. Each year, nine REU students will be recruited to participate in 10-week summer research projects. The research projects performed by the REU Site participants, supervised and mentored by UM faculty and graduate students, will address key research challenges in semiconductor materials and devices, focusing on three thrusts: (1) wide bandgap materials and devices, (2) complex oxide materials and devices, and (3) nanotechnology for devices. These projects will address key societal needs that can be met by semiconductor materials and device innovation such as: photocatalysis for solar fuels and carbon sequestration needed to mitigate the effects of climate change; new materials and integration methods to achieve nanoscale control of electronic properties for the next generation of computational circuits and high-resolution sensors; and innovation in photonics circuits and efficient power conversion devices to reduce global energy consumption. In addition, the REU Site activities will mentor students to develop critical scientific thinking skills and technical expertise. The Site will furthermore provide professional development opportunities, to enable the participants to confidently pursue graduate studies and careers in STEM and nanotechnology. Post-program evaluation will be performed to assess the success of the Site in achieving these goals. The scientific discoveries, technological advances, and hands-on training and career development of diverse cohorts of participants accomplished via this Site will support expanded U.S. leadership in semiconductor technology.\r\n\r\nThis Site is supported in part by funds provided to the National Science Foundation by the Semiconductor Research Corporation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
