 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs in response to the solicitation of proposals that promote the recovery, recycle, and/or reuse of helium initiated by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. The University of Toledo is acquiring a helium recovery system to capture and reliquefy helium from four NMR spectrometers which support the research of Professor Yong-Wah Kim along with colleague Jon Kirchhoff. This equipment supports research in the areas of synthetic chemistry, polymer chemistry, catalysis, and drug discovery. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. Using the intrinsic magnetic properties of atomic nuclei, it is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The superconducting magnets of these instruments rely on regular deliveries of liquid helium to maintain their operation. However, the instability in the helium supply due to global and national challenges jeopardizes research programs relying on NMR spectroscopy. A helium recovery system collects the helium boiloff from the superconducting magnets of NMR spectrometers and then reliquefies the helium for reuse. This equipment supports the educational, research, and teaching efforts at all levels in multiple departments as well as academic and industrial researchers throughout northwest Ohio.  \r\n\r\nThis award is aimed at supporting research and education at all levels. Specifically, this helium recovery system collects the helium boiloff for reliquefication and reuse from the superconducting magnets which sustains the operation of the institution\u2019s four NMR spectrometers. The NMR instrumentation supported by this equipment enables numerous research projects including the rational design of transition metal catalysis for C-H activation and functionalization and the development of recyclable bio-based co-polyesters for packaging. The equipment sustains instrumentation which involves harnessing nitrogen-centered and transition metal complexes for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing heterocycles and the development of organometallic catalysts for green chemistry. Other research projects benefitting from this award include the study of nitric oxide release from neuroprotective nitric oxide mimetics and the development of inorganic and organometallic catalysts and reagents.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
