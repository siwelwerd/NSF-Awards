 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports student travel for attending the 62nd Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems (MWCAS) to be held in Tucson, AZ in August 2023. The MWCAS is a premier international conference in the field of circuits and systems. Other than tutorials, keynote, and plenary lectures by leading experts in the field, the conference will be attended by academic and industry researchers and students to present their recent work both in lecture sessions and poster sessions. The conference will host a student paper competition to encourage the best students to keep abreast of the most modern technologies. Recipients of this grant will be selected from the pool of students presenting papers and will be paid part of their expenses for travel and registration at the conference. US citizens and permanent residents will be given the highest priority in the selection process. The experience gained by the students in the process is going to be an invaluable component of their education. Due to the large number of industrial participants in the meeting, the experience will also help them to secure positions in industry, thus contributing to the much-needed technological workforce of the United States. The selection committee will pay due attention to supporting women and people from underrepresented groups through this grant.\r\n\r\nThe technical areas covered by the conference will, in general, be electronic circuits and systems relevant, among other problems, to modern computing hardware technologies. More specifically, the broad spectrum of topics to be covered will include, but will not be limited to: Analog and Mixed Signal Circuits and Systems; Digital Integrated Circuits and Systems; Power and Energy Circuits and Systems; Sensory Circuits and Systems; Signal, Image, and Multimedia Processing; Communications Circuits and Systems; RF and Wireless Circuits and Systems; Biomedical Circuits and Systems; Neural Networks and Neuromorphic Engineering; and Beyond CMOS Circuits and Architectures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
