 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports early career scholars in developing research and professional networks in cartography and geographic information science (GIScience) through participation with the International Cartographic Association. This project targets the professional development of early career scholars who are currently completing a graduate degree or are in the first five years of their academic or professional career. Cartography is advancing quickly with new research opportunities afforded by the availability of crowdsourced data. There are also important research challenges related to the general topic of map design and map quality given the prevalence of cartographic representation in different forms of media. There is a newfound attention on geographic routing with the widespread use of mobile devices for real-time navigation. The International Cartographic Association advances these research arenas through collaborative opportunities and dissemination of cartographic research while supporting of the next generation of cartographers and spatial scientists.\r\n\r\nThe International Cartographic Association (ICA) advances research and scholarship at the forefront of cartography, data science and Geographic Information Science. In particular, the ICA advances research that addresses the role of cartography in data science and citizen science; the role of map in mobility research and autonomous driving; research at the intersection of cartography and cognitive science; and the role that maps play in preserving the world\u2019s cultural heritage. New research agendas are developed to scientific advances that tackle key societal challenges; disseminate new research in cartography and GIScience through workshops, seminars, and peer-reviewed publications. The ICA also develops valuable training through pre-conference workshops, mentorship and scholarly exchange. Opportunities for new collaboration are created for early career scholars working on cartographic research from the perspective of disparate disciplinary foundations fostering new transformative and transdisciplinary research in cartography.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
