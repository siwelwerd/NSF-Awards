 "awd_abstract_narration": "Methods and new techniques in artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly being\r\ndeveloped, extended, and applied to challenging problems in biology. At the\r\nsame time, as new experimental methods, new data collection efforts, and\r\ngreater understanding are developed in biology, the class and scope of problems\r\nthat are amendable to AI approaches is growing. Extreme interest and rapid\r\nprogress in AI has also made the AI research landscape diverse and complex,\r\nwith a number of related, competing, and overlapping technologies and\r\napproaches being advanced. This rich ecosystem is a boon to research and\r\ninnovation, but it also makes identifying threads and pressing problems more\r\nchallenging. Thus, there is a need to survey the current frontier of the\r\ninterface between AI methodology and biology and to chart future directions and\r\nchallenges. We propose a 2-day, online workshop to address that need. This\r\nworkshop will host invited talks by researchers working on foundational AI\r\nmethods in biology. New directions and connections between emerging AI\r\nmethodologies and problems in biology and health will be identified,\r\nsynthesized, highlighted, and formalized. The workshop will catalyze discussion\r\nand help set the agenda for future research in this area, helping to launch new\r\ndirections and solidify promising ones.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will consist of approximately 13 talks and 4 discussion sessions\r\nover two days. Speakers will be selected based on their prior work and\r\nexperience with developing new foundational AI methodology that answers\r\nbiological questions. Speakers will be asked to focus on one or more of the\r\nfollowing foundational AI themes as related to biology and human health: (1)\r\nFairness and Social Effects of AI; (2) Federated Learning; (3) Generative Deep\r\nLearning Models; (4) Scalability of AI; (5) Privacy and Security in AI; (6)\r\nMethod Optimization and Automated Algorithm Design; (7) Explainable AI and\r\nCausality; (8) Active Learning and Automated Science; (9) Transfer Learning;\r\nand (10) Incorporation of Prior Knowledge in AI. Though the workshop cannot\r\nhope to deeply cover all these foundational aspects, we aim to cover as many as\r\npossible. Speakers will connect these foundational computational techniques to\r\nproblems in biology in areas such as genomics, structural biology, drug\r\ndevelopment, systems biology, biomedical imaging, neuroscience, and disease\r\nforecasting.  With permission of the speaker, the talks will be recorded and\r\ndistributed over the internet, and participants will be invited to contribute\r\nto a publication that surveys the identified themes, directions, and\r\nchallenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
