 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in accelerating the transition to a more sustainable food supply chain, which could democratize access to healthy foods and lessen food insecurity.  The US system for growing and distributing fresh food is inefficient and insufficient in the context of climate change. Controlled environmental agriculture (CEA) is seen as a potentially revolutionary way to supply food demands with limited resources.  Despite this promise, the high energy requirements of creating lighting and cooling in enclosed environments to support photosynthesis has caused CEA not to realize its promise.  In the project, a novel solution to improve energy efficiency in CEA farms is proposed where advanced optics, machine learning, and computer vision are used to ensure that all of the light that is emitted by synthetic light sources is optimally used for plant photosynthesis and growth.  The project offers a plausible way to create reliably profitable operations for CEA producers which would lead to enhanced access to fresh produce for consumers and decreased reliance on conventional agriculture to meet the world\u2019s food needs.\r\n\r\nWithin current commercial grow systems for controlled environment agriculture, a substantial portion of the photons are wasted as they are not incident onto photosynthetically active biomass and are absorbed by the surrounding grow rack and media. This project will prototype and systematically test a light production system that dynamically shapes light such that it is rendered only onto the photosynthetic areas of the plant.  To accomplish this, the project will develop and evaluate (within three crop varieties) a closed-loop system to autonomously detect the three-dimensional shape of the growing plant and dynamically adjust the light intensity and projection area to optimize power efficiency and biomass growth. Successful completion of the work in this project will result in a novel technology that is systematically tested to yield similar quality produce using a fraction of the energy consumption of current state-of-the-art systems.  Deployment of this technology would help to improve the unit economics of controlled environment agriculture produce items and accelerate adoption of controlled environment agriculture farming practices that potentially consume less water, utilize land resources more efficiently, and eliminate the need for chemical pesticide/herbicide treatments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
