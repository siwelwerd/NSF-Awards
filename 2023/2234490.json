 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation \u2013 Research Partnership (PFI-RP) project is far-reaching for both the commercial space industry and the biomedical industry.  The proposed product addresses a critical technological gap and bottleneck in complex three-dimensional (3D) tissue biomanufacturing on Earth and in low-Earth orbit. The proposed technology, which combines a microgravity-optimized culture vessel with advanced cryopreservation capabilities, would be transformative for the in-space biomanufacturing community and open a broad range of on-Earth biomedical applications for space-made biologics.  The innovation may accelerate the establishment of a new space-based biomedical industry and motivate further innovation to develop self-sustaining and fully automated biosatellites to produce space-made biologics for Earth health benefits. This project represents a training opportunity for the affiliated graduate students to gain hands-on, real-world, biotechnology entrepreneurial experience.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project is based on the proposed integration of two cutting-edge technologies: microgravity-facilitated tissue self-assembly and isochoric supercooling tissue preservation. This project, if successful, will determine the thermodynamic and biological parameters that will enable isochoric supercooling cryopreservation of complex 3D bioengineered tissues within a microgravity-optimized tissue culture bioreactor.  The goal is to develop a commercialization-ready tissue engineering system with advanced cryopreservation capabilities that can generate, store, and transport living, complex, 3D bioengineered tissues between low-Earth orbit and Earth.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
