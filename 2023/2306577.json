 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Lincoln University (PA) seeks to create an interdisciplinary Center for Forensic Sciences (LU-CFS), enhancing the institution\u2019s curricular offerings, modernizing laboratory capabilities, and improving library resources. The project aims to increase the number of well-qualified, minority student graduates having the foundational skills necessary to excel in graduate programs and/or forensics laboratories by providing opportunities for high impact practices such as internships, professional networking, and interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this project is to establish an interdisciplinary Forensic Science Certificate Program encompassing chemistry, biology, biochemistry and criminal justice. The course curriculum for the Certificate Program will be designed in accordance with the Forensic Education Program Accreditation Commission (FEPAC) academic standards through enhancements of existing courses, and the development of new courses. Research and internship opportunities working alongside faculty, practitioners and other forensic professionals will be developed while creating professional networking opportunities for students. Laboratory space will be modernized with instrumentation such as gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) comparable to what is used in forensic science laboratories, while existing library resources will be expanded through addition of key forensic science journals. It is anticipated that this project may address the disproportionate participation of African Americans and other minority groups in STEM fields, specifically in the forensic sciences where underrepresentation restricts full participation in the criminal justice system and the due process of law.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
