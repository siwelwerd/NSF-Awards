 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year renewal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program, Fluid Mechanics with Analysis using Computations and Experiments (FM-ACE), at the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa will host 9 undergraduate students over 10 summer weeks in exciting and emerging areas related to fluid mechanics. The project team will engage and mentor a diverse cohort of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups with limited access to research facilities in exciting and emerging areas related to fluid mechanics. A major goal is to increase the number of engineers who pursue a graduate education and develop a group of highly educated engineering researchers to enter the U.S. workforce. The projects will advance knowledge in new research areas relevant to national and global challenges in the areas of climate, energy, and space/defense which all relate to the fluid mechanics, thereby furthering our country's prosperity. The field of fluid mechanics is unique and multidisciplinary. Fluid mechanics is still an engaging field of study where innovation and exciting discoveries are actively taking place, such as high-speed imaging, advanced laser diagnostics and powerful computing. One additional aspect of this program that makes it unique is engaging undergraduate students to all phases of a rewarding research experience.\t\r\n\r\nThis three-year renewal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program, Fluid Mechanics with Analysis using Computations and Experiments (FM-ACE), at the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa will host 9 undergraduate students over 10 summer weeks. The participants doing research in exciting and emerging areas related to fluid mechanics will be presenting their research at the American Physical Society Division of Fluid Dynamics (APS DFD) conference. This component of the program acts as an important follow-through mechanism to further encourage REU participants to pursue graduate studies and contributes to the success of the site by motivating both the student and mentors to obtain quality research results. Other important objectives include providing a structure wherein research and technical communication skills are cultivated. This site involves basic and applied research in fluid mechanics across a range of engineering disciplines as well as the training of undergraduate students in state-of-the-art laboratory environments. Students will contribute to projects that include, as a sampling, fundamental turbulence studies in CFD performing Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) on high-performance computers (HPC), Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) investigations of bio-inspired boundary layer control mechanisms, and combustion studies using a color schlieren system. Moreover, as in the past, we will recruit at least half of the participants from colleges with limited STEM research opportunities. The gained experience and all outcomes of the site including applicant statistics will be made publicly available.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded with the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
