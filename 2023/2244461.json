 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a three year Research Experiences for Undergraduates site at Michigan State University. Eight students per year will participate in an eight-week summer program. The program emphasizes the participation of undergraduate students who are at an early stage of their study of mathematics and who aspire to a career in research in the mathematical sciences. Two primary goals underpin the program\u2019s structure. First, the program seeks to increase access to research opportunities, especially for students who are not already committed to pursuing graduate studies or who do not have access to research opportunities at their undergraduate institution. Second, the program contributes to ongoing research in the mathematical sciences through work on accessible research problems with experimental and theoretical components suitable for students at an early stage of their studies.  Both of these goals contribute to the national effort to recruit and retain promising and talented students with a strong interest in the mathematical and physical sciences.  \r\n\r\nThis REU site supports students who are at an early stage of their study of mathematics.  Students from underrepresented groups, who have only completed one or two years of study of mathematics, or who are without access to large research departments are selected as participants.  Students learn to read research articles; formulate conjectures and construct examples; program simulations; concentrate, listen, and ask questions; generalize and simplify proofs; and disseminate their discoveries.  Students are immersed in an environment where the mathematical ideas are new and not fully understood.  Students work in small research teams and present their progress on a regular basis to all REU participants. The program stimulates interest in mathematics via research on accessible open problems.  The students acquire mathematical sophistication and progress towards a career in the mathematical sciences.  Discoveries contribute to several areas of active research including knot theory, game theory, optimal transport, random fractals, and topological data analysis.  Results are shared in conference presentations and in research publications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
