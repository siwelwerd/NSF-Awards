 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cascadia Region Earthquake Science Center (CRESCENT) has a specific focus on the science related to seismic hazards originating from the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ). Single-discipline research on the CSZ has been extensive, however much remains unknown. Recognizing the necessity of interdisciplinary research, CRESCENT aims to aggregate diverse research efforts into system-level models using advanced high-performance computing simulations, data science, machine learning, laboratory experiments, and field observations. Pursuing transformative activities, such as state-of-the-art simulations of earthquake processes and high-resolution modeling along the CSZ, CRESCENT\u2019s objective is to deepen the understanding of the behavior of this and potentially other subduction zones around the world. In addition, CRESCENT will focus on fostering regional and national resilience against earthquake hazards through extensive collaboration with various community partners at the federal, state, local and tribal levels. Translating scientific insights into practical applications for seismic hazard resilience in the Pacific Northwest is one of the focus areas of this geohazard center. Emphasis on building a diverse geoscience workforce, with initiatives targeting students across all levels is another focus area. CRESCENT\u2019s priorities with respect to community engagement and feedback, will ensure a dynamic, iterative relationship between science, policy, and society. Ultimately, CRESCENT aims to be a nexus for earthquake hazards research, workforce development, and community connections, establishing a new paradigm of collaborative Earth science research for societal good. This award was co-funded with the Marine Geology and Geophysics program in the Ocean Science Division.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Cascadia Region Earthquake Science Center (CRESCENT) is to study earthquakes originating from areas where an oceanic tectonic plate slides under a continental plate. These are known as subduction zones. Cascadia, in the Pacific Northwest, is a region, where the subduction zone can produce the most powerful earthquakes on our planet, causing serious damage to society. Although there has been a lot of research, there is much that remains unknow and this is where CRESCENT activities come in. By using cutting-edge technology and analysis methods CRESCENT plans to pool together research from various scientific disciplinary sources and make sense of the subduction zone. The center\u2019s focus on understanding how big subduction earthquakes can affect people and infrastructure can help better prepare society for these future events. CRESCENT outreach work to educate the public as well as future scientists about earthquakes aims to ensure that everyone understands the risks associated with subduction earthquakes and how to protect themselves. CRESCENT intends to create a workforce that represents the diversity of our society by making an effort to connect with people from all walks of life. The overarching goal of CRESCENT is to become a hub for all things related to earthquake research and preparation by connecting scientists to local communities and develop practical safety measures. The team believes their work will not only benefit the region around the Cascadia subduction zone in the Pacific Northwest but can also be applied to similar earthquake-prone areas around the U.S. and the world. The initiative of this center is about more than just science; it's about using that science for the betterment of society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
