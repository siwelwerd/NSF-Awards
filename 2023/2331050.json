GREPSEC promotes increased engagement in computer security research, specifically targeting women and underrepresented groups through mentorship. The goals of the workshop are to increase diversity in the field.  Prior GREPSEC attendees have gone on to publish in a range of venues, mostly focused on the field of cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
