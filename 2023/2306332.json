This meeting will take place at the University of Bristol on 5\u20137th July 2023.  The conference will focus on highlighting recent mathematical achievements, spanning topics from Analytic Number Theory, to Quantum Chaos, to Random Matrix Theory.  This award will facilitate interaction between early career mathematicians and the leading experts in the field. \r\n\r\nHalf a century ago, mathematicians discovered that various behaviors of the Riemann zeta function can accurately be predicted by particular large Hermitian random matrices. In the intervening years, ideas from quantum chaos, statistical physics, probability, combinatorics, and more, have furthered our understanding of the Riemann zeta function and other L-functions. One of the most recent advances has been the significant progress towards the Fyodorov-Keating conjecture(s) concerning extreme values of the Riemann zeta function and of characteristic polynomials. This conference will bring together experts working at these interfaces alongside early career researchers, and provide ample opportunity for learning and discussion. \r\n\r\nThe conference website is https://web-eur.cvent.com/event/0c99dff3-c047-4cd1-b82a-dba87f804733/summary?RefId=SOM\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
