 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need for preparing highly effective secondary mathematics and science teachers who identify as members of racial and ethnic populations that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines relative to their numbers in the general population. Research shows that racially and ethnically diverse students do better academically, socially, and emotionally with teachers who are similarly diverse. This project aims to address the shortage of such teachers. The project will offer a bridge-to-teaching program during the recruitment phase, learning communities during the preparation phase, and a community of practice during the induction/support phase. \r\n\r\nLed by a team of investigators at Prairie View A&M University (PVU) this project features partnerships with the Houston Independent School District (ISD), Royal ISD, Sheldon ISD, and Spring ISD. The five-year project goal is to prepare 24 racially and ethnically diverse students to be mathematics and science teachers. These undergraduate students will earn their teacher certification through the PVU Teach Program while completing an undergraduate degree in their STEM discipline. Project activities are motivated by social cognitive career theory and will focus on building a community of racially and ethnically diverse mathematics and science teachers as Noyce Scholars. Three objectives will guide the execution of the project. First is to recruit students from early college high schools and from within the PVU mathematics and science departments to participate in a bridge-to-teaching program. Second is prepare these prospective teachers through the UTeach model in learning communities. Third, and finally, is to support the newly certified teachers during their first year of teaching through a community of practice. The project results will potentially advance knowledge and understanding of research- and evidence-based STEM teacher recruitment, preparation, and retention strategies focused on building community in terms of students\u2019 self-efficacy, STEM identity, and interest in STEM teaching. The project also has the potential to positively impact society by increasing the number of highly effective racially and ethnically diverse secondary mathematics and science teachers who possess the cultural competence, pedagogical knowledge, and disposition to be successful in high-need school districts. Project evaluation will focus on describing and assessing the overall quality of implementation and outcomes from a case study perspective. The dissemination plan using traditional and non-traditional outlets will communicate and amplify the project\u2019s intellectual merit and broader impacts. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
