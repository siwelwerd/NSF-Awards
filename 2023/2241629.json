 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much effort has been made toward attempting to improve our understanding of what variables inhibit and aid gender equity efforts. Studies of what drives social change in gender norms have tended to focus primarily on measuring women\u2019s experiences; little is known about why certain men opt to support equity efforts more than others. This doctoral dissertation project addresses this gap, documenting variation in men\u2019s beliefs about gender equity, and the consequences they face for violating patriarchal norms. This project trains a graduate student in methods of scientific data collection and analysis. The results of the project will be shared in scientific publications and with relevant organizations, highlighting implications for the improved design of culturally sensitive equity initiatives. \r\n\r\nThe project will be conducted in a rural community undergoing rapid socioeconomic changes associated with urbanization. The researchers will use focus groups and interviews to first capture local understandings of what it means for men to support women\u2019s equity across multiple dimensions (i.e., economic, social, sexual, and reproductive autonomy), and provide in-depth knowledge of men\u2019s personal experiences challenging the status quo. From this foundation, survey data will be used to estimate the consequences of men violating traditional norms for their relationships with other men (e.g., community respect, capacity for leadership) and women (e.g., desirability as a partner, control of reproductive decision-making). The project will also examine how men\u2019s age and education modify their experiences. Through this in-depth study, the research will provide insights into the costs and benefits of gender norm violation, evaluating and enhancing anthropological theory regarding the drivers of cultural change and gender relations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The research took a mixed methods design, combining quantitative attitudinal surveys and in-depth qualitative data collected via focus groups and subject interviews. All data was collected in a fast-urbanizing community in northern Tanzania. While data analysis and report writing continues, our initial findings identify divergent understandings, between women and men, youth and elders, about what beliefs and actions constitute support for women&rsquo;s empowerment. This finding demonstrates how gender norms are actively renegotiated during times of upheaval and transition, and has methodological implications for how gender role ideology can be best measured and impacted by interventions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that men experience a suite of both perceived benefits and costs of challenging prevailing gender norms, depending on their own individual and social circumstance. Urbanization provides some incentives for men to selectively support aspects of women&rsquo;s empowerment, including due to increasing economic returns to women&rsquo;s labor market participation. However, such incentives are weighed against strong beliefs regarding male authority, fertility preferences and gender-appropriate behavior that may be more resistant to change.&nbsp;This project supported a graduate student researcher who led on the data collection and report writing, and involved collaboration with multiple Tanzanian researchers.
