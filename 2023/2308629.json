 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to clarify the complicated relationships between archaeological material culture networks and past social networks. Social network analysis is used to study the structure and dynamics of interactions among social actors at a variety of scales. Network methods provide a means to study the relations between entities and how those relations affect outcomes. The usefulness of this approach in archaeology is attested by its rapid adoption, yet there remain substantial questions regarding the fundamental nature of the material culture networks used as proxies for social networks. Archaeologists typically use similarities between types of artifacts as a proxy for the probability that social groups interacted in the past. But what type of interaction is represented by similarities in ceramic pots? Is it the same type of interaction as that represented by similarities in arrowheads? This dissertation research is designed to answer these questions using multilayer network analysis. This form of analysis handles multiple networks in at once, which will allow the researcher to conduct a study comparing many types of material culture using data from the Western Pueblo Region of the Southwest United States between AD 1150 and AD 1500. This region has an excellent chronological record and archaeological coverage, which makes it an ideal area to test the efficacy of using material culture networks as proxies for social networks. By determining how different material culture networks correlate with each other, this research will inform the broader archaeological community regarding the ways different types of material culture may or may not reveal different aspects of past social networks. Furthermore, this study will be the first to formally explore the network trajectories of communities across a period of rapid social-organizational change in the Western Pueblo region. The research also involves significant collaboration with the living descendants of the ancient inhabitants of the Western Pueblo region who will provide native interpretations of the results of this study.\r\n \r\nThe first portion of the study involves archival research documenting thousands of projectile points across the Western Pueblo region. Images will be obtained of each projectile point for use in a geometric morphometric analysis that uses homologous landmarks on each projectile point to mathematically compare similarities in outlines. A smaller sample of projectile points will also be scanned in 3D to compare the entire surface of the point to make a more detailed comparison. The second portion of the study combines the projectile point analysis with existing databases on ceramics, architectural features, and geochemically sourced obsidian and ceramics. These data will be converted into material culture networks used to represent ancient social networks. The networks will then be analyzed using standard multilayer and individual network analysis methods to compare the differences between them and to examine the trajectory of change throughout the Western Pueblo region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
