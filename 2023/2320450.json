 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) to acquire a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM; Hitachi HT7800 120 kV), which will significantly boost the research and teaching activities spanning several disciplines, such as biology, earth, environmental, marine sciences, chemistry, physics, mechanical engineering, health and biomedical sciences, immunology and microbiology. As one of the largest minority-serving institutions in the USA, UTRGV is dedicated to the academic growth of over 30,000 students, more than 90% of whom are Hispanic. The acquisition of this state-of-the-art microscope will increase several societal benefits, including enhancing research capabilities, improving educational quality, and expanding participation by underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. UTRGV's strategic position along the US-Mexico border in the heart of deep south Texas makes it a key environmental and public health research center. The acquisition of the TEM, a first for the region, shows UTRGV\u2019s dedication to continue leading in scientific exploration and innovation. In addition, the microscope will become an integral part of various courses and programs, exposing more students to this cutting-edge technology and sparking their interest in STEM professions.\r\n\r\nThe instrument will enable high-resolution imaging and analysis of various biological, chemical, and physical samples, providing critical data for investigators and students working on projects such as studying plant responses to insects, zebrafish neuron reactions to environmental chemicals, and theranostic nanoparticles for magnetic hyperthermia cancer treatment. The instrument will also examine the morphology of nanofibers for applications in energy, optoelectronics, water treatment, healthcare, food packaging, and biomedical sectors, as well as the ultrastructure of bordered pits in plant tissues to understand plant drought resistance. Its user-friendly features, such as the integrated high-resolution camera and patented non-toxic sample preparation technologies, make it a valuable tool for education and hands-on training. The acquisition of the microscope will expand research and teaching efforts at UTRGV, providing undergraduate and graduate students with practical experience and exposure to real-world applications. This exposure should improve their employability and competitiveness for advanced degree programs. Moreover, the microscope will foster collaboration across various departments and schools, thus strengthening the mission of UTRGV to become an R1 institution. Overall, this acquisition will solidify UTRGV's reputation as a leading institution for STEM research and education, particularly benefiting underrepresented minority students, ultimately helping the Rio Grande Valley and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
