 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 2023 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Biomechanics in Vascular Biology and Disease, which will be held 6-11 August 2023, at Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, Massachusetts,  through support of registration fees for selected students, postdoctoral fellows, and early-stage investigators studying in the US to attend. The objective is to broaden the participation of a diverse group of students, postdocs, and early-stage investigators (assistant professors appointed within the last three years), including women, underrepresented minorities, disabled, and disadvantaged groups. Consideration in the selection process will be given to the inclusion of members of underrepresented groups, the diversity of institutions that the participants represent, and the diversity of programs representing broad areas of engineering and biology. This brand-new 2023 GRC Meeting will bring researchers together to discuss the topics involved in cardiovascular biomechanics, mechanobiology, and their roles in cardiovascular disease while promoting active engagement across all participant groups, especially young investigators, students, women, underrepresented, and disadvantaged groups to ensure future growth.\r\n\r\nThe 2023 GRC meeting is a significant expansion of the International Symposium on Cardiovascular Biology and Disease, which has been held annually as a small transatlantic conference. The Symposium activity began in 2005 as the Shear stress symposium by the cardiovascular biomechanics and imaging group in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The Symposium has been gradually expanding and evolving as International Symposium on Biomechanics in Cardiovascular Biology and Disease meetings since 2012. The 2023 GRC aims to provide a forum to bring together engineers, biologists, and clinicians who study biomechanics in cardiovascular biology and disease in the nation and internationally. The Program will have a keynote session, eight sessions, four poster sessions, and a Power Hour session, which will discuss the effect of biomechanical forces, including shear stress and wall stress, on the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and aneurysms. \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by Biomechanics and Mechanobiology (BMMB) program in the CMMI division and Engineering of Biomedical Systems (EBMS) program in the CBET division.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
