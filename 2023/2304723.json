 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award provides support for early career U.S. based mathematicians to attend a summer school at the IHES near Paris, France in July 2023. The summer school is called Recent Advances in Algebraic K-theory (July 10-21, 2023). The proposal includes professional training for graduate students and junior career mathematicians from throughout the United States. Few workshops on these topics have been held in the United States in the past few years. The summer school will be a critical opportunity for students and postdocs to be exposed to new techniques and ideas, to forge new collaborations, and to learn about new questions at the state-of-the-art of the field.\r\n\r\nThe program will cover a diverse mixture of topics from K-theory and p-adic cohomology theory, centered around the theme of the interaction of new motivic filtrations related to syntomic cohomology and algebraic K-theory. This includes traditional topics, such as excision and the question of descent in K-theory, but also emerging topics such as Selmer K-theory and the K-theory of rigid analytic spaces in the condensed framework. Further information about the school can be found at https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/8837/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
