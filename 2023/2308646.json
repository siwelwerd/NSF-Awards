 "awd_abstract_narration": "Volcanoes that produce explosive eruptions are very hazardous because they can create widespread ash clouds that are risky for aviation and cause damaging ash fall downwind. The White River ash (WRA) dacite tephra beds found in eastern Alaska and western Canada resulted from three of the most explosive eruptions (VEI 6) from a North American volcano, Mt Churchill, in the past ~2000 years. Those eruptions harmed the indigenous Dene people living in the areas downwind in present day Canada, resulting in a southward migration out of the impacted area. The current global reach of air traffic and the increased human population in downwind regions today mean that a similar-sized eruption from Mt Churchill could potentially cause catastrophic economic and human impacts. Despite its potential hazards, little is known about the source of its explosive, silicic magmas. This study will help us better understand where the magmas that feed Mt Churchill\u2019s eruptions are stored in the crust. Although this volcano does not have a dedicated seismic monitoring network, knowledge of where the magmas live beneath the volcano can help us better estimate what might happen if the volcano becomes restless again in the future. Students will take part in this research during two summer courses taught by the PI at UAF. These courses will involve field trips to learn about the WRA deposits in eastern Alaska, collect samples, and then students will learn how to conduct experiments in the lab. The support from this grant will help cover student fees and field trip costs to encourage broad participation of students from historically excluded groups to help increase diversity in the geosciences. As a member of the Alaska Volcano Observatory, the PI will work closely with AVO colleagues to incorporate the results from this work into AVO operations and outreach efforts.\r\n\r\nThis study will use high pressure and temperature experiments to create a magma plumbing system model for the WRA eruptions. The team will build on petrological data from prior studies, which include mineralogy, temperature, and oxygen fugacity estimates needed for the experiments. They will use plagioclase-hosted melt inclusions to estimate entrapment pressures and volatile compositions by micro-FTIR analyses of H2O and CO2 (if present) and electron microprobe analyses of S and Cl. If reacted amphiboles are found, textural analysis will enable the team to estimate magma ascent rates using prior experimental calibrations. The petrology of the WRA tephra is well-suited for phase equilibria experiments, and the relatively low temperature range constrained by prior work allows for experimental methods that are suitable for student work and have a relatively low failure rate. The experiments will contribute to a magma plumbing system model for the WRA eruptions from Mt Churchill. These results will also be provided to researchers maintaining thermodynamical models to help augment their empirical datasets for increased accuracy applied to plagioclase and amphibole-bearing dacite to rhyolite magmas.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by Petrology & Geochemistry and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
