 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a High-Resolution Multichannel Electrical Resistivity Imaging System for sub-soil exploration and advanced soil characterization and parameterization in the field of engineering, soil science, and agriculture. In the context of sizeable earth infrastructures and agricultural lands, understanding large-scale sub-soil characteristics is critical. This instrument will enable the quantitative hydraulic and physical characterization of soil on a large-scale impacting several engineering and scientific disciplines and providing a foundational understanding of sub-soil behavior. It has the potential to bring advanced ideas to next-generation engineering that will serve the national interest in maintaining the resiliency of the nation\u2019s infrastructures. It will also enable advancements the field of agriculture and soil science, providing a means of developing advanced techniques for greater agricultural yield. The educational and training components of the project will facilitate hands-on experiments using the instrument and enable the underrepresented student community to explore STEM careers.  \r\n\r\nThis acquisition of a High-Resolution Multichannel Electrical Resistivity Imaging System will provide a comprehensive platform for in-situ quantification of critical soil parameters. The instrument will be deployed in various earth infrastructures and agricultural lands to measure soil moisture content, matric suction, conductivity, soil water storage, and the salinity property of soil. The instrument will also enable correlating significant soil parameters and their variability with the geophysical property of soil (electrical resistivity) under varying climates, as well as large-scale sub-soil mapping of critical soil parameters. These measurements and correlations will validate the improved performance, efficiency, and resiliency of infrastructures and agricultural lands. The unique capabilities of the instrument will facilitate the achievement of specific goals in the following areas: 1) large-scale sub-surface investigation to evaluate the climatic change effect on earth infrastructure, 2) characterization of unsaturated soil, 3) investigating soil moisture dynamics and large-scale quality control of infrastructures, 4) rapid evaluation of soil water storage capacity for landfill covers, 5) smart agricultural for crop productivity, and 6) soil salinity appraisal in agricultural improvements. Together, this instrument will facilitate multi-disciplinary research collaborations across engineering, agriculture, and soil science.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Instrumentation Research Program (MRI) and the division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
