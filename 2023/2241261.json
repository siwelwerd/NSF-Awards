The conference will feature three panels and student and paper presentations on issues regarding the responsible conduct of research with human subjects, particularly in decision-making experiments. The conference will focus on difference across fields such as economics, social psychology, marketing, medicine, and human-computer interaction. The goal is to build capacity for use-inspired interdisciplinary research that requires insights from multiple disciplines to achieve important goals.\r\n\r\nThe conference will help advance infrastructure for training and education in these sciences, will encourage partnerships between academia, industry, and policymakers, and will help to build a cohort of young scientists, engineers, and practitioners who advance the state of the art in working with personal data, privacy, and laboratory experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
