 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Mathematics and Machine Learning 2023\" to be held at Caltech, Pasadena, CA on December 10-13, 2023 will bring together diverse groups of mathematicians and data scientists to discuss problems at the interface of these two disciplines. With the increasing role of artificial intelligence (AI) in everyday life and, more recently, in mathematical research, the time is ripe to start a regular annual meeting on this subject. Just like development of the World Wide Web started in the scientific community, the mathematical approach to machine learning can stimulate development of better AI algorithms and architecture whose future applications can extend far beyond 'pure' sciences. At the same time, advanced tools in machine learning start playing a major role in mathematical research, sometimes assisting expert mathematicians in making progress with some of the most difficult mathematical challenges. Although the interaction between the two communities seems natural, the opportunities are extremely limited and one of the main goals of the conference \"Mathematics and Machine Learning 2023\" is to fill this void.\r\n\r\nThe interactions between mathematics and machine learning (ML) can be roughly organized into three broad areas: the use of ML for very challenging cutting-edge problems in mathematics, the mathematical theory of ML, and the use of ML in automated proof assistants. All of these areas will be represented at the conference \"Mathematics and Machine Learning 2023.\"  This award provides support to the speakers and to junior participants, with the priority given to underrepresented groups, Ph.D. students, and speakers/participants with no other sources of funding. Further information will become available on the conference website: https://mathml2023.caltech.edu/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
