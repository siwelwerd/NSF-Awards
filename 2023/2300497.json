 "awd_abstract_narration": "The shift towards battery powered electric vehicles continues to change the landscape of public and personal transportation in the United States and shows no signs of slowing down. While development of infrastructure ramps up and the number of electric vehicles on the road continues to grow, the impact on the automotive and heavy equipment repair industry will need to be addressed. This project from Linn Benton Community College (LBCC) seeks to address the growing skills gap facing automotive and heavy equipment technicians in southwest Oregon. The college will leverage its existing automotive and heavy equipment diesel facilities to create a new one-year certificate that will focus on electric vehicle and hybrid vehicle technology. As part of this effort, the college will make a special effort to engage more female students in the college's advanced transportation technology program. Finally, the project will promote the development of advanced vehicle technician education programs regionally through a collaborative effort including neighboring community colleges and high schools.  \r\n\r\nThe project team recently completed an industry survey of dealerships, independent repair shops, and municipalities in the region to gauge their needs for current and future workers. Results from this survey will inform the creation of a new one-year certificate, which will be a new stackable credential that will contribute to the existing Advanced Vehicle Technology degree. Instructors from LBCC will complete industry recognized training to prepare them for the creation of six new courses on Advanced Transportation and Battery Vehicle Technology. To increase the representation of females, the college will participate in customized training sessions to make systemic changes that should result in increased female enrollment. Practices from this training will create a culture of support for female students, and should ultimately help to diversify the electric vehicle workforce. Results from this work will be shared regionally among Oregon's 17 community colleges, and nationally through the ATE community. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
