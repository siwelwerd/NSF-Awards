 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC) and Conference on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) conferences are recognized as the foremost academic conferences in theoretical computer science (TCS) globally. TheoryFest, a satellite event of STOC, comprises various workshops and additional programs. The purpose of this travel grant is to enable students from underrepresented communities to attend STOC 2023 and TheoryFest, FOCS 2023, and the TCS for All events, which will coincide and be co-located with STOC and FOCS. This financial support will offer students the opportunity to participate in these leading conferences, which not only enhances their intellectual growth but also foster community enrichment by encouraging interaction with a diverse mentoring panel, contributing significantly to the event's success. With this funding we aim to provide financial support to eight students to attend STOC 2023 and eight students to attend FOCS 2023.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
