 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \u201cFrontiers in Stochastic Analysis\u201d will be held at the University of Illinois at Chicago, in Chicago from Aug 09 to Aug 11, 2023.  It covers a variety of topics in stochastic analysis. These topics are deeply related to each other and reflect current trend of research in the field. The plenary speakers have been chosen by a scientific committee, not only for their outstanding research records but also for their excellent lecturing style. Their talks will provide an overview of several frontiers of current research in the field. In addition, the conference features a program of short talks. This program provides young researchers, senior graduate students and post-docs in particular, with an opportunity to showcase their research. \r\n\r\nProbability theory is the mathematical theory concerned with the analysis of random phenomena. Many of such phenomena may mathematically be modeled by continuous stochastic processes or random fields.  Stochastic analysis is an active branch of probability theory that provides a wide range of tools to study those processes and fields. The choice of research topics of the conference reflects several aspects of stochastic analysis areas that have become the object of intense study in recent years. The broad array of topics covered will broaden the scope and interest of graduate students and early career researchers. The conference also provides an easily accessible platform for interaction among different generations of researchers in the field and for communication among different areas of stochastic analysis. The conference website is: http://frontierstochastic.weebly.com/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
