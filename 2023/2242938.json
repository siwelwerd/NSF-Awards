 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Catalyzing a New York Climate Solutions Community of Practice aims to address the national need for an organized and unified response to the climate crisis as well as New York State\u2019s policy commitments outlined in the Climate Act. Through this conference series, Strategic Energy Innovations (SEI), in partnership with the State University of New York (SUNY) system, will identify and convene a multi-campus network of institution types within the SUNY system. The Community of Practice will engage up to 30 faculty members, administrators, student services staff, and facilities leaders through a process of identifying common goals, addressing challenges, and exploring examples of successful programs that accelerate climate solutions across stakeholders in higher education. This project will serve the public interest through its potential to transform campus operations, increase the awareness of and strengthen student career pathways focused on climate change, and improve faculty comfort and access to resources for teaching about climate change.\r\n\r\nStrategic Energy Innovations (SEI) will work across a cohort of 6 campuses within New York\u2019s SUNY system in order to break down traditional silos in higher education institutions and across sectors by sharing interdisciplinary, evidence-based practices for educational and workforce development climate efforts. The Community of Practice, anchored within SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) will also work to amplify resource gaps in an effort to produce interdisciplinary curriculum and resources within and beyond the Geosciences Departments at New York higher education institutions to increase adoption of climate workforce development efforts. The Community of Practice will build the capacity of higher education leaders to: 1) share practices and strategies regarding integration of climate solutions into cross-disciplinary curriculum, 2) understand and find climate connections across departments and campus; and 3) increase the learning outcomes and practical experience for higher education students. Through this project, faculty and staff will develop improved teaching strategies and workforce development practices, empower students to increase their climate solution efforts, and integrate geoscience resources and research into cross-disciplinary materials and on-campus living lab opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
