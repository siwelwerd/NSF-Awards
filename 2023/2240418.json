 "awd_abstract_narration": "An earthquake develops when rocks deep in the Earth suddenly break, or when sudden offset or 'slip' occurs along a pre-existing fault. Geoscientists lack detailed knowledge of rock failure and fault slip behavior, and this is one reason that efforts to forecast damaging earthquakes have not been entirely successful. Earthquake fault slip begins below the Earth's surface where it cannot be directly observed, so scientists perform laboratory experiments to simulate miniature earthquakes in blocks of rock under controlled conditions. Tisato and their team will develop new laboratory techniques to generate small earthquakes in the lab, and will take detailed measurements of quantities like fault slip speed, rock temperature, vibrations, and fault strength in an effort to better understand their mechanics. Tisato's experiments are unique in that they can simulate long sequences of earthquakes and can see how these earthquakes interact with each other. Knowledge gained from these experiments can be applied to real-world faults using mathematical equations, and may enable scientists to identify phenomena that could signal an upcoming large earthquake. \r\n\r\nCurrently, experimental systems of earthquake processes belong to two general types: (A) Rotary shear apparatuses that produce large displacements under controlled slip-velocity but cannot simulate the spontaneous nucleation, propagation, and seismic recurrence of natural earthquakes, and (B) Stick-slip systems that simulate the spontaneous nature of earthquakes but are limited to small displacements. This proposal will integrate the capabilities of these two experimental types into one system that can simulate the key earthquake features of spontaneous nucleation and rupture propagation, along with millimetric to metric slip displacements. The preliminary results of this unique method already produced a gamut of typical features of natural seismogenic faults, including high-intensity events due to fast rupture propagation and high slip velocity, large slip displacements, foreshocks, and slow-slip events. The planned use of transparent materials and high-speed cameras will allow the observation of the processes happening on the laboratory fault while monitoring acoustic emissions as earthquake analogs. Experiments will also be performed on rock samples, and the analyzed results will be applied to validate natural earthquake models. The intrinsic nature of the method is well-tailored for statistical and machine-learning algorithms that could be used to create earthquake forecasting models. The project will also focus on outreach by creating educational materials and providing laboratory experiment experiences for undergraduate and high-school students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
