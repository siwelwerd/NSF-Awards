 "awd_abstract_narration": "Light detection and ranging technology, also known as LiDAR, underpins advanced remote sensing systems used to detect, identify, and create a precise 3D virtual image of an object. The automotive industry has driven much of the current interest in LiDAR. Many modern safety features found in cars and trucks rely on LiDAR. Autonomous vehicles use LiDAR to identify and avoid obstructions, other vehicles, and people. In addition, LiDAR is now being used in a wide range of other applications such as mapping, infrastructure inspection, utilities, and architecture, resulting in a growing demand for technicians skilled in LiDAR technology. This project will address the demand for skilled LiDAR technicians by creating a certificate program that will allow students in various majors and fields to become proficient in the use of LiDAR technology. Students will learn how LiDAR can be applied to their industry of interest, resulting in an increase in the number and variety of students prepared for employment as LiDAR technicians.\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on the use of LiDAR use in a wide range of areas, such as three-dimensional (3D) structure scanning, precision roof and building inspection, and site analysis for development, to include realistic 3D scans of buildings for virtual walkthroughs, accurate measurements, virtual inspections of structural integrity, and many other applications. There are three overarching goals of the project. First is to create two LiDAR courses that address the emerging need for skilled technicians. Second is to create a certificate program to address the use of LiDAR in architecture. Third, and finally, is to recruit and retain a diverse population of successful students who represent the surrounding community with an emphasis on marginalized populations. This project will serve as a model for other academic institutions interested in developing a comprehensive program aimed to help address the shortage of well-qualified and skilled LiDAR technicians. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
