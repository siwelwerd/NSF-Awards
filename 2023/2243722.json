 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year REU site, Inclusion and Innovation in Medical Devices, at the University of Massachusetts Lowell will provide undergraduate students with a unique opportunity to explore innovations in medical devices in a multidisciplinary environment and to pursue advanced education, research, and careers in STEM fields. The ten-week summer program provides REU students with opportunities to engage in various research projects in biomedical engineering with a focus on medical devices. Students will learn how human factors engineering can address diversity and inclusion, preventing bias in medical products as well as designing diversity and inclusion into universal technology. They will participate in research studies, professional development, and social activities, and network with industry professionals. The research program will enhance the ability of students to undertake interdisciplinary research through cutting-edge projects that focus on the innovative engineering of medical devices. The program also aims to inspire students to pursue advanced education, research, and careers in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis three-year REU site, Inclusion and Innovation in Medical Devices, at the University of Massachusetts Lowell will provide undergraduate students with a unique opportunity to explore innovations in medical devices in a multidisciplinary environment and to pursue advanced education, research, and careers in STEM fields. The REU site will host 8 undergraduate students for 10 weeks each summer and offer various research projects in diverse yet cohesive themes in biomedical engineering with a focus on medical devices. Students will participate in research, professional development, and social activities and will have the opportunity to network with industry professionals. This REU Site pursues inclusion and innovation in medical devices through multidisciplinary approaches. Students will learn about  integrating physics, chemistry, and engineering to tackle medical problems, and how human factors engineering can address diversity and inclusion, preventing bias in medical products. The research program will enhance the ability of students to undertake interdisciplinary research through cutting-edge projects that focus on the innovative engineering of medical devices. The program also aims to inspire students to pursue advanced education, research, and careers in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
