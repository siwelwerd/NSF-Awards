 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a sensing system that may provide invaluable and continuous insights into tree health and forest function at both large and small scales.  The market for this device will range from individual to industrial scale farmers wishing to tailor automated irrigation systems directly to address when trees (e.g., all varieties of tree nuts, avocado, coffee, fruits, etc.) experience stress or require specific moisture conditions to stimulate flowering or fruiting.  Other users may include governments and non-government organizations (NGOs) seeking to manage forested regions to assess the potential for wildfire ignition and spread, as well as scientific instrumentation companies who supply researchers seeking to understand forest responses to climate and disturbances. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a smart-sensing system for the detection of water stress in trees in response to local microclimates. Trees experience water stress at different intensities and time scales that may often be decoupled from soil moisture status. The proposed smart sensing system combines standard meteorological observations with novel measurements of within-tree water flow and content. This system features a tree-water content sensor capable of continuously monitoring water within different layers of a tree\u2019s xylem tissues. Prior field research has shown that xylem tissues that are no longer actively transporting water may still serve as a water reservoir during times of drought for some species. Observations of tree water storage have shown promise in their ability to pinpoint the onset of water stress within a living plant in real time. In addition, data collected by this sensing system may be combined with remote sensing observations to extend predictions from single trees or orchards to entire regions to develop predictions for wildfire ignition potential.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Trees experience water stress at different intensities and time scales impacting tree function and potential mortality. For instance, trees have the highest water content just before dawn after recharging their hydraulic system overnight, and the lowest water content in mid-afternoon after a full day of losing water to transpiration, regardless of soil water availability. On longer time scales, trees experience water stress progressively as soil water declines between watering periods or rainfall events. Tree-water dynamics are further complicated by the variety of water use strategies employed by each species to dynamically regulate water uptake and loss in response to changing soil and weather conditions. In fact, many species' water use becomes decoupled from shallow soil moisture observations, common in most agricultural and silvicultural applications, during cases of low soil moisture. Therefore, our smart sensing system combines standard meteorological observations (i.e. temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, rainfall, and shallow soil moisture) with novel observations of tree-water flow and content. This sensing system demonstrates Intellectual Merit by allowing simultaneous observations of water storage and transport within the xylem of mature, living trees in conjunction with a full suite of meteorological measurements. This technology allows us to observe when trees begin to reduce photosynthesis and water use in the face of stress, and how long recovery takes after water stress is alleviated.
