 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sanjana Curtis is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at UC Berkeley. Curtis will conduct simulations of kilonovae, which are electromagnetic transients related to the synthesis of heavy elements like gold. Results from this project will build a strong theoretical understanding of kilonovae and their progenitors, as well as provide light curve templates for future multi-messenger surveys. For the outreach component of the project, Curtis will make educational videos on two topics: 1) the astrophysical origin stories of the elements of the periodic table, and 2) conversations with scientists about a day in their life.  \r\n\r\nCurtis will carry out three-dimensional, end-to-end simulations of kilonovae produced by merging compact binaries, bridging the gap that extends from the end of merger simulations to the kilonova phase. She will investigate outflows from both binary neutron star and black hole - neutron star mergers to create 'the kilonova zoo' -- a database of kilonova light curves and spectra spanning the landscape of progenitor properties. Comparison of these models with past and future kilonova observations will allow us to tie kilonovae to their progenitors, constrain the properties and composition of merger outflows, infer total ejecta masses, and reveal whether neutron star mergers are the only site of the rapid neutron-capture process. This project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
