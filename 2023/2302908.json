 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Regional Innovation Engines Development Award is focused on making Connecticut (CT) America's accelerator for quantum technologies. It will create a national competitive advantage in an emerging technology domain with applications in healthcare, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and finance. The effort will extend opportunities to demographics left behind by cycles of economic downturn, thereby driving economic and workforce development in service of equitable opportunity. It will move beyond workforce training to connect opportunities in innovation and entrepreneurship to people from communities in need of economic renewal. Development Award partners include the University of Connecticut, Yale, and their technology incubation programs; the cities of Stamford, Hartford, New Haven, and Waterbury; the CT Department of Economic and Community Development, CT Next, Advance CT, and Connecticut Innovations; CT Workforce Council and the Connecticut State College and University System; the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, and many small and large companies. Given its number of important economic sectors, its strength in relevant research, the rural-to-urban character of its communities, its cultural diversity, and the differentials in opportunity available to its residents, CT is positioned to become America's quantum accelerator by transforming a diverse region into an economic development powerhouse. \r\n\r\nAdvanced manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, and finance industries anticipate that quantum technologies will contribute to next generation approaches to sensing, cryptography, AI, infrastructure optimization, drug and therapy development, software, and cybersecurity, to name just a few.  The team will develop strategies for use-inspired R&D in two broad, interrelated topics: 1) quantum materials, hardware, computers, and devices; and 2) quantum software and algorithms, involving world-class research infrastructure and faculty in applied sciences, engineering, and business/ entrepreneurship. The region's industries will contribute to the effort as adopters and end users and will leverage their R&D capabilities to support the Development Award. The team will plan for a multifaceted approach to train a knowledgeable, skilled, and diverse workforce accommodating all skills levels, from technical high school and associate, to baccalaureate, graduate certificate, master, and Ph.D.-level preparation. Academic and workforce partners spanning research universities, colleges and community colleges, technical high schools, and technical training centers will ensure that the team develops the full spectrum of talent needed to support quantum industries. This Development Award will enable the team to build regional partnerships, develop workforce strategy, and analyze the potential of quantum technologies to address future needs of strategically important industrial sectors, laying the groundwork for a full NSF Engine.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
