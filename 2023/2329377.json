 "awd_abstract_narration": "SageFox Consulting, in collaboration with the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), will support the 2024 Computer Science for All (CSforAll) Principal Investigator (PI) and Community Meeting. The CSforAll program supports partnerships and research that helps equip high school teachers to teach computer science, K-8 teachers to incorporate computer science and computational thinking in their classes, and school districts to create computing pathways across all grades. This convening will provide opportunities for the principal investigators of projects funded by the CSforAll program to share their research outcomes, promising practices, and lessons learned. The PI meeting is intentionally co-located with the 2024 CSTA Conference, to leverage the premier venue for sharing PreK-12 computer science practitioner research and practice.\r\n\r\nThe 2023 CSforAll PI and Community Meeting will support cross-project learning among active CSforAll grant awardees. The goals are to (1) inform CS for All projects through exposure to the most current research and practice perspectives of the CS teacher community;  (2) provide a venue for disseminating CS for All research outcomes, promising practices and lessons learned with an audience ready to improve the CS educational experience; (3) create opportunities for collaboration and networking among researchers and practitioners committed to broadening participation in computing; and (4) bring evaluators together to support the program evaluation of the CS for All program.  For this event, there is a pressing need to meticulously plan and organize agenda, venue and conference logistics. This grant provides funding for the venue and logistics, including conference registration, audio visual, and meeting space for the CSforAll PI and Community meeting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
