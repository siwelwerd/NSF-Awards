 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the recent decades, much of the western U.S. has experienced abrupt increases in wildfire activity, posing numerous challenges and undesired impacts to humans, ecosystems, and landscapes. Resolving these challenges requires a different restorative approach that centers Indigenous fire stewardship, advances fire science through cross-cultural collaborations and interdisciplinary research, and expands participation within the fire science and fire management workforce. The Karuk Tribe, located along the Klamath River of northwestern California, holds a long history of stewarding the region\u2019s ecosystems with fire and are well recognized leaders in the advancement of prescribed fire and fire management on an international scale. While strides have been made to enhance Tribal Sovereignty and engagement with fire management, further work toward interconnecting knowledge systems to promote equitable solutions remains. This planning project will coordinate a series of events focused on interconnecting Indigenous and Western knowledge systems to create reciprocal relationships of exchange and center Native protocol for data and knowledge use to develop effective solutions to altered wildfire regimes. A primary outcome of the project will be to solicit input on high priority fire-related research, monitoring, and educational needs of the Karuk Tribe and to assemble a team of researchers and practitioners to develop tangible, innovative, community-based project ideas for future development.\r\n\r\nThis innovative planning project will coordinate a series of collaborative workshops and working group meetings focused on interconnecting Indigenous and Western knowledge systems related to fire science and management within the Karuk Ancestral Territory. As part of these efforts, the investigators plan to advance four core areas related to the application of fire: 1) interdisciplinary and cross-cultural research, 2) co-production of knowledge with managers and practitioners, 3) intergenerational learning, and 4) restoration monitoring and research. The researchers plan to address these objectives by leveraging the success of existing partnerships between the Karuk Tribe, California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, and other organizations, to provide a setting that is inclusive of cultures, backgrounds, and disciplines and supports tribally directed efforts in such a way that respects Tribal Sovereignty and leadership. Specific outcomes of this project will be to: 1) develop and refine protocols, policies, and agreements of collaboration among academics and the Karuk Tribe; 2) advance tribal sovereignty and leadership through identifying tribally centered research, management, and educational priorities; 3) foster cross-cultural and interdisciplinary collaborations to address wildfire related challenges; and 4) developing action plans to craft innovative and interdisciplinary proposals that are receptive to NSF program directives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
