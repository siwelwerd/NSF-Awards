 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a three-dimensional scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. A laser Doppler vibrometer incorporates a technique that uses coherent light to measure the velocity of vibrating objects. This instrument will allow high-fidelity measurements of vibrations for high-temperature, lightweight, and rotating structures. This will enable a breadth of research projects that have the potential to be significantly impactful in the areas of providing sustainable energy sources, using lightweight materials to develop fuel-efficient cars, and improving human health. It will also enhance research in the areas of non-destructive inspection, energy, lithium-ion battery monitoring, additive manufacturing, and material science. The instrument will be integrated into the current Kettering University curriculum and outreach programs, such as Academically Interested Minds, that target underrepresented minority and low-income students to build interest in science, technology, engineering, and math learning. The system will be used as a shared research, training, teaching and outreach tool to support interdisciplinary efforts at Kettering University as well as collaborators from other regional universities at Michigan State University, Oakland University, University of Michigan-Dearborn, University of Michigan-Flint, and Grand Valley State University.\r\n\r\nThe three-dimensional scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (3D SLDV) will be used for high-frequency and high-spatial-resolution applications. This capability will be especially critical for research activities in the areas of (1) biomedical engineering, research on acoustic pressure in ultrasound therapy, and skin and soft tissue characterization, (2) structural health monitoring and damage detection, (3) material modeling and microstructure optimization to develop materials with improved vibration performance, (4) microstructural characterization of acoustoplastically deformed structures, (5) uncertainty characterization in additive manufacturing of metamaterials, (6) dynamic analysis of tires and contact patch mechanics, and (7) monitoring of Lithium-Ion batteries. Altogether, the 3D SLDV will provide researchers at Kettering University and collaborators with a robust, non-contact, full-field measurement system with a wide frequency range that can be readily used for in situ measurements of complex structures.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Instrumentation Research Program (MRI) and the division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
