 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create new computational capabilities using experimental investigations to understand fracture and failure in 3D printed polymer composites. 3D printing is transitioning from demonstrative prototypes to functional products that impact a wide range of industrial sectors. However, many polymer-based 3D printed parts are prone to fracture and failure. This limits their applications in load-bearing components. Various polymer composite filaments reinforced with particles and/or fibers are being developed to improve the performance of 3D printed components. The current research and development are hindered by the complex variabilities of 3D printing. It thus largely remains in a trial-and-error stage with insufficient scientific guidance. This project will develop a science-based strategy that combines computational modeling and simulations with an optimal suite of experiments. This approach helps to gain a fundamental understanding of multiscale fracture as well as to quantify uncertainties associated with 3D printed polymer composites. The new knowledge achieved through this research can develop new technologies for 3D printing of high-performance components. The outcomes of this research can be applied to a broad array of industries. The research will be complemented by educational and outreach activities. These include curriculum enhancements, hands-on 3D printing workshops, and STEM education programs that engage K-12 and underrepresented minority students.\r\n\r\nThis project will take on the challenges of quantifying the process-structure-property-performance relationship and deriving multiscale fracture mechanics mechanisms for additively manufactured polymer composites. Although additive manufacturing is capable of printing parts with relatively complex geometries, several fundamental issues must be addressed before AM can advance to producing functional composites. Current limitations include microstructural defects due to strong thermal gradients induced during manufacturing, heterogeneous interface bonding conditions, and large fracture and failure performance variations. The research objectives of this project thus include: 1) developing direct mesoscale simulations capable of predicting thermo-mechanical-chemical coupling and fluid-structure interactions during the additive manufacturing process, which will address fundamental questions of how motions and deformations, temperature gradients, melting/solidification between filaments and reinforced particles/fibers interplay with one other in assocoation with micro-crack nucleation and propagation; 2) deriving multiscale modeling of fracture based on machine learning of micro-crack simulations and phase-field models of macro-crack predictions, with in-situ monitoring of manufacturing processes and multiscale experimental characterizations being used for direct model validations; and 3) developing an optimal model-based uncertainty quantification protocol that organizes computational and experimental activities to validate the model, investigate parameter sensitivities, and quantify process/property variations. The research outcomes will advance fundamental knowledge of the complex interplay between additive manufacturing process parameters and fracture behaviors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
