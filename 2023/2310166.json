The conference will be held in April 2023 in Raleigh, North Carolina. ISPASS is a top conference in the field of computer systems and software. The conference is sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Computer Architecture, Technical Committee on Microprogramming and Microarchitecture, and Technical Committee on Internet. ISPASS provides a forum for sharing advances in academic and industrial research focused on performance analysis and the design of computer systems. Students will be able to attend all events associated with the conference, as well as a rich set of workshops and a diverse tutorial program. Students with disabilities or those attending with a child under one year of age may request additional funds to support a travel companion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
