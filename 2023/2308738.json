 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in order to diversify the STEM workforce. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines: Blacks and African Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students, highly qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM. The need for cultivating STEM talent has been well established. For the United States to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. \r\n\r\nThe Nutmeg State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation will bring together the four regional public comprehensive universities in Connecticut.  The alliance is led by Southern Connecticut State University (SCSU) and includes partner institutions: Central Connecticut State University (CCSU), Eastern Connecticut State University (ECSU), and Western Connecticut State University (WCSU).  The primary goal is to increase the number of STEM graduates from underrepresented groups at each institution over the five-year period of the grant.  The Nutmeg State alliance will employ comprehensive gateway mathematics and science course interventions to improve the early retention of students in STEM majors. These interventions include first-year learning communities, experiential learning, and summer bridge programs. Early research experiences with faculty mentors followed by an internship will build student self-identity as a scientist, computer scientist, or mathematician.  \r\n\r\nThe results of these initiatives will be shared with our feeder community colleges and high schools to better inform and prepare students from underrepresented groups interested in STEM before they come to undergraduate STEM programs. Finally, the alliance will enhance collaboration and strengthen ties between the local industry and STEM researchers to further facilitate institutionalization and sustainability of successful recruitment and retention practices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
