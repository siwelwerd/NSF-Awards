 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proteins are very large biological molecules synthesized in living organisms by linking hundreds or even thousands of amino acids to form a linear chain. Proteins are required for life and they are thus important targets for fundamental and biomedical research, including drug development, and biotechnology. Enzymes catalyzing biochemical reactions, protein drugs such as insulin, and antibodies conveying immunity are well-known examples. Importantly, the biological function of proteins is intimately linked to the many different three-dimensional shapes the linear chains can adopt, and these shapes depend critically on both temperature and pressure. The objective of this project is to enhance the understanding of the distinct shapes which proteins adopt at extreme conditions, that is, at very low temperatures below the freezing point of water and/or at very high pressures of several hundreds of atmospheres. This is required to understand life in the vast ecosystems existing under these conditions (e.g. in oceans and the polar regions), to understand how these shapes relate to protein function, protein related diseases, protein vaccine development, and protein drug formulation, and to enhance the engineering of bio-technologically and bio-medically important \u2018cold adapted proteins\u2019. The research contributes to develop rules to predict protein shapes and their energetic properties under such extreme conditions, and newly developed methodologies and computational tools will be made available to the broader scientific community. The project enables cross-interdisciplinary training of researchers, including scientists from underrepresented groups. To pursue this goal and to increase interest in STEM in general, Drs. Kuhlman and Szyperski, participate in well-established, major initiatives at their schools which are dedicated to promote inclusive communities, to retain underrepresented students in STEM and to mentor students. They also  participate in NSF-funded research opportunities for undergraduates, and offer webinars on \u2018linchpins\u2019 for the understanding of (bio)physical chemistry and (bio)physics. Programming workshops focusing on methods for molecular modeling will also be offered.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between the different three-dimensional molecular shapes of proteins dominating at different temperatures / pressures is related to their molecular energies and entropies, which are represented by so called \u2018energy landscapes\u2019. Proteins which tend to lose a well-defined shape at low temperatures have been named \u2018cold unfolding proteins\u2019. Research focuses on exploring and understanding the energy landscapes of such proteins. This includes the structural and thermodynamic properties of the \u2018cold\u2019 low energy / low entropy states, their transitions to other states and, in general, a more advanced understanding of protein pressure-temperature \u2018phase diagrams\u2019. A unique approach combining computational de novo protein design, cutting-edge biophysical techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is employed in order to specifically test central structural and thermodynamic hypotheses, namely that (i) a mixed hydrophobic / hydrophilic protein core results in a partially cold unfolded cold state in which water molecules form an integral part, (ii) this is manifested in complex energy landscapes, (iii) this results in a distinct thermodynamic signature for the formation of such cold states, and (iv) the co-operativity of the formation of the cold states decreases with an increasing hydrophilic content of the folded core. Moreover, the research lays the foundation to tackle the hypothesis that cold states can be functionally important, even at ambient conditions when they are lowly populated. Finally, new computational design protocols are developed which facilitate or enable the design of beta-sheet containing cold unfolding proteins, and the redesign of folded, naturally occurring proteins to congeners which unfold under extreme conditions in order to validate newly established principles. This project is supported by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
