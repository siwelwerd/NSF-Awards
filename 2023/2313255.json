 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference proposal requests funds to support student participation in the IEEE International Conference on Digital Health (ICDH), scheduled for July 2-8, 2023, in Chicago.  ICDH brings together leading researchers, community leaders and visionaries from academia and industry, end-users, and healthcare professionals, in the area of digital health to share their research, practical experience, and visions of the future of sustainable health and social care transformations. The funds will be used to provide travel support for eight students, cover registration fees for 30 students, and prizes for a student research project competition. This support will serve both societal goals around broadening participation, enrich the intellectual diversity of the conference, improve dissemination of the latest results around digital health to a wider population, and further the training of the next generation of researchers interested in digital health.\r\n\r\nThe organizing committee is looking to expand the benefits of the conference by (1) providing opportunities to students, with priority to underrepresented graduate students, to present their original research work in ICDH and providing a forum to showcase initial research project ideas under the mentoring of expert researchers as student research competition; and (2) diffusing and fostering digital health research among the medical community with the help of medical experts closely related to the digital world.  The PIs will accomplish these goals by providing travel support to students who have papers accepted at the conference, and by hosting a student competition for US-based graduate students, with the grant covering the conference registration fees for the students participating in the competition. Students selected for the competition will also participate in virtual mentoring sessions with conference speakers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
