 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation award enables the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) to administer a travel grant program for approximately one hundred U.S. based mathematical and computational scientists, early career faculty, and graduate students to attend the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 2023), to be held August 20 - 25, 2023 in Tokyo, Japan. The ICIAM is the premier international conference for applied mathematics, with approximately 500-750 U.S. participants anticipated. Travel grants to applicants will be awarded on a competitive basis. Applications will be evaluated by a panel of professional mathematical and computational scientists to select a diverse group of well-qualified researchers.\r\n\r\nApplied and computational mathematics are global enterprises with significant impact on technology and economic development. ICIAM is an effective way to foster the interaction of U.S. mathematical and computational scientists with the international community of researchers and practitioners from academia, government and industry. The program for ICIAM 2019 will be distinguished by its focus and its outstanding speakers selected by the scientific program committee. Focus areas in applied, industrial and computational mathematics will be chosen based on their current and future importance. More information about the conference is available at http://iciam2023.org/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nThe goal of this grant from the NSF DMS Infrastructure Program was to fund travel for U.S.-based mathematical and computational scientists, early career faculty, and graduate students to attend the Tenth International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM23) held in Tokyo, Japan, August 20  25, 2023. Held every four years, ICIAM is a worldwide congress for industrial and applied mathematics that has high prestige, visibility, and impact. Travel awards were designed to help cover air transportation, lodging, and registration costs consistent with the rules and procedures of the National Science Foundation. An important objective of this grant was to help ensure strong participation of U.S.-based researchers in this high-profile international congress. Ninety-two people attended ICIAM23 with support from this grant. \n\n\n\n\nSIAM established a website with information on ICIAM23, including details about the travel awards and a link to SIAMs travel awards portal. Through this portal, SIAM collected 187 travel award applications; 33 of which were from researchers who earned their Ph.D. degree before 2017, 77 of which were from early career researchers, and 78 of which were from students. 72 applicants self-identified as women, 109 self-identified as men, 1 self-identified as non-binary, 1 self-identified as other, and the rest preferred not to answer. Sixteen applicants self-identified as Hispanic or Latinx and 28 applicants self-identified as a race other than Asian/Asian American or White.\n\n\n\n\nA committee of seven mathematical scientists evaluated the materials submitted by each applicant (a letter of application, a recent CV, and a letter of recommendation).\n\n\n\n\nParticipation in ICIAM23 was especially important for graduate students and early career researchers since it allowed them to present their work, engage with the latest research from around the world in their areas of focus and, equally importantly, to establish contacts with researchers that they might not be able to meet in other circumstances. Their participation in ICIAM23 has contributed to the advancement of the mathematical sciences, it has accelerated the professional development of the U.S.-based workforce, and it has elevated the stature of U.S.-based research in the mathematical sciences on the world stage.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/01/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SuzanneLWeekes\n"
