 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF-ARMI|BioFabUSA Workshop: Facilitating Advanced Tissue Manufacturing, will be held in Manchester, NH during the summer of 2023. The workshop focuses on state-of-the-art tissue fabrication technology and identifies grand challenges and opportunities for future work in this field. The workshop addresses the mission of NSF, which has been increasingly committed to integrating the engineering sciences with the life sciences, encouraging research and development in multidisciplinary areas, educating the next generation of young scientists, and translating cutting edge science to solutions for current and future challenges. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will focus on converting manual processes for tissue manufacturing to protocols that can be implemented in fully automated and closed tissue manufacturing environment. It will provide a forum for industrial practitioners and academic researchers in the tissue manufacturing space to interact and create productive networks. It will also provide a demonstration of the integrated Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) capabilities of the ARMI/BioFabUSA tissue manufacturing facility, as well as an explanation of how those facilities might be accessed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
