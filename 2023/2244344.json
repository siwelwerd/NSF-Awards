 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate students majoring in physics or related fields will conduct research in solar astrophysics and space physics with faculty and graduate students at Montana State University. The research aims to improve our understanding of physical mechanisms that govern energy release in the Sun's atmosphere and its effect on space weather. Students develop and strengthen practical research skills and learn to apply academic knowledge acquired in classrooms to solving real-world research problems. The program encourages participation by under-represented groups and helps grow students' interest in STEM research and career. In particular, the research experience with professional scientists in a university environment helps students make informed decisions about continuing their education and research in these fields.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to 1) provide undergraduate students with high-quality research experience, 2) develop independence, creativity, and interest in space physics and astronomy graduate study, 3) demonstrate how academic knowledge relates to real-word research problems, 4) develop and strengthen practical research skills of participants, and 5) enhance participation by underrepresented students in STEM research and career advancement. For ten weeks during the summer, students will analyze and model state-of-the-art observations from space missions and ground-based telescopes, and also learn to build instruments that obtain these data. Possible research topics include measuring properties of magnetic reconnection and flare energetics, hydrodynamic simulation of solar flares, acceleration of coronal mass ejection in the low solar corona, solar cycle variation of solar irradiance, reconstructing trajectories of coronal ejectas observed by the Parker Solar Probe, and space and ground-based hardware development.   The projects frequently result in joint professional publications and conference presentations. The program also provides a variety of professional development opportunities, such as computer and programing tutorials, lectures and research seminars by both university faculty and visiting scholars, and student research presentations and group meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
