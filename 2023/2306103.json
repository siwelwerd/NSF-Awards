 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the Annual meeting of the GRC in Panama the group endorsed a Statement of Principles (SOP) on Research Ethics, Integrity, and Culture in the Context of Rapid Results Research following a year-long series of discussions at each of the regional meetings on the topic.  The discussions and break out groups at the Annual Meeting in Panama were productive and well-received and generated widespread interest in continuing these conversations. This proposal furthers these efforts and will fund a workshop adjacent to the upcoming America\u2019s Regional Meeting in Uruguay in 2022.  Workshop participants would develop a model for exchange of best practices on Research Integrity that is specific to the Americas but that could be modified for use in other regions. This effort will both continue ongoing discussions and provide an important contribution to other bilateral and multilateral conversations about research security and research integrity taking place across the world. A particular focus will be how to support responsible internationalization of research that attends specifically to research integrity and security considerations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Successful collaborations happen when organizations have similar standards, concerns, and goals, allowing scientists to concentrate on new discoveries rather than getting bogged down by rules and regulations. To improve how we handle and oversee international research funding, a special workshop was held at the America&rsquo;s Regional Meeting of the Global Research Council (held in Montevideo, Uruguay, November 16, 2022). The workshop supported efforts to create a shared approach for the Americas, aiming to exchange knowledge on how to conduct research responsibly and securely. The workshop attendees are developing a training program that covers real-life situations from the region, offers materials in multiple languages, reaches different kinds of people, and is flexible in how it is administered. The progress made in this workshop was shared at a related event during the 2023 Global Research Council meeting in the Hague. Funding helped a representative from the Americas (from Guatemala) attend this event and share what they learned from the workshop. The insights gained from this project are valuable for creating strong research policies in the U.S., which will enable more international research collaborations and learning opportunities between U.S. scientists and researchers worldwide.
