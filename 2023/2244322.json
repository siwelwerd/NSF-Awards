 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Earth and Planetary science Interdisciplinary Internships program at Carnegie will introduce the process of research at the intersections of: Astronomy, Astrobiology, Bio-/Isotope Geochemistry, Cosmochemistry, Data Science, Experimental Geochemistry, Geophysics, High-Pressure Mineral Physics, Mineralogy, Organic Geochemistry, and Petrology; to undergraduate students without significant previous research experience. The EPIIC REU will provide the resources and opportunities needed for undergraduate students, especially those with limited options for STEM-related research, to grow into a new generation of scientists. The program will recruit its students from a highly-diverse group of institutions that includes community and liberal arts colleges, 4-year universities with/out strong research programs. At least half of the internships will be offered to under-represented groups in STEM education (race, gender, income, disability, veteran status). The program will immerse students into a vigorous research environment to build participant self-confidence as they gain new skills, and thus foster their future involvement in science. EPIIC will provide a learning environment that embraces diversity, prepares students for academic careers, and which is based on mutual respect for peers\u2019 intellectuality and ideas; thus preparing them to be active members of our pluralistic society. The project, therefore, is expected to promote the progress of science and advance the prosperity and welfare of postsecondary students.\r\n\r\nIn this highly interdisciplinary REU program, students will conduct cutting-edge research and gain hands-on experience that includes training with sophisticated experimental and analytical equipment. The 10-week program is planned to ensure successful completion of students\u2019 research activities and expects their participation in national meetings and peer-review publications. Students will be full members of their mentors\u2019 research groups, attend weekly seminars and social events, and live together on the campus of American University to help establish a collegial cohort. EPIIC\u2019s intensity and training will prepare its participants for graduate student life. Maintaining student-mentor(s) communications beyond the summer REU program is encouraged to facilitate participant transition into STEM-related careers. The program will be evaluated by a series of surveys and tools employed under the guidance of an external advisor. The long-term success of the program success will be measured by: i) the number of REU students who follow a STEM-related career, including the number of community college students that transfer to a 4-year university as science majors, ii) the extent of the participation of students underrepresented in STEM education, and iii) students\u2019 understanding of the broader impacts of scientific discovery on the establishment of an ethical, inclusive and fact-driven society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
