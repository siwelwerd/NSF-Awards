 "awd_abstract_narration": "Linear elasticity has been widely and successfully used to study the mechanical behavior and properties of many solids.  However, linear elastic solids are mechanically passive and cannot do work on their surroundings. As an alternative route, this Boosting Research Ideas for Transformative and Equitable Advances in Engineering (BRITE) Pivot award supports fundamental research to elucidate how odd elastic solids, or linear elastic solids whose mechanical response is non-symmetric, can exhibit unique dynamical phenomena previously seen in quantum mechanical systems. Insights from this study will provide a fundamental understanding of novel and distinct approaches to controlling, guiding, redirecting, attenuating, amplifying, and using mechanical wave energy using simple, elastic solids. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of this research, this understanding may significantly impact a diverse suite of fields, including multifunctional metamaterials, energy harvesting, soft robotics, condensed matter physics, and vibration control. In addition, this award will support: the inclusion of high school students in research, integration of research and education for outreach to high school students, and the development of digital educational content in mechanical engineering curricula.  \r\n\r\nWhile linear elasticity focuses on solids having a symmetric stiffness matrix, odd elasticity focuses on linear elastic solids whose stiffness matrix is not symmetric.  This research aims to elucidate the fundamental structure-property relationships that enable a solid exhibit a non-symmetric stiffness matrix, and furthermore, what role the interplay between chirality and nonreciprocity has in governing emergent odd elastic behavior in solids.  By developing an anisotropic chiral, nonreciprocal elastic field theory, the effects of both directional and chiral nonreciprocity on the mechanics and non-Hermitian dynamics of odd elastic solids will be captured.  This interdisciplinary effort will bring new insights into the mechanisms by which asymmetric elastic solids enable emergent dynamical behavior and properties that are not possible in classical, linear elastic solids and structures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
