This includes invited talks on some of the most impactful developments in the field as well as a number of contributed talks selected among an ever growing number of submissions.\r\n\r\nThis award enables student travel awards, and members of underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Students, who otherwise would not be able to attend, will be exposed to the state of the art in theoretical and applied cryptography, as presented by experts from both academia and industry. In addition, students will have opportunities to learn about internships and job openings, and to discuss employment and collaboration with more senior members of the field. The results of the conference, and the awards made possible by sponsors will be made available to the research community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
