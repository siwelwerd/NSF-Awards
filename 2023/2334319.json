 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the development of artificial intelligence (AI) to better understand how to realize the benefits of AI and minimize risks.  A interdisciplinary group of researchers from the social sciences and humanities will analyze the position of AI as part of society and not a purely technical system. The project develops the model for a research center in AI focusing on three critical aspects of the AI crisis: trust, equity, and literacy.  The research project identifies how to trustworthiness in AI as a fundamental pillar for human reliance the use of AI. The project emphasizes the role of equity and fairness in the application of AI. This project advances the potential for all people to develop basic AI literacy so they can interact with it safely and responsibly.\r\n\r\nThis project brings together leaders in multiple disciplines to plan for the proposal of a Center for Humane AI Studies (CHAIS). The research team consists of an interdisciplinary group of scholars from multiple social-sciences, humanities, computational and health sciences. The research program identifies and studies the ways that AI can both exacerbate and ameliorate social crises through a focus on three areas: 1) trustworthy AI operationalized as the intersection of ethical AI and human-centered AI, 2) equity and AI considering the concern that automated systems often entrench existing inequalities or discriminate against marginalized people, and 3) research in the development of AI literacy because AI is increasingly becoming integrated into various aspects of our lives, from everyday consumer products to complex decision-making processes in areas such as healthcare, education, finance, and transportation. The CHAIS project organizes a number of activities to develop capacity in convergent AI research, including  an innovation salon, reading group, special topics courses, workshops, and a seminar series. The project creates learning and knowledge opportunities through K-12 teacher training, faculty development, and a graduate level public policy program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
