 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Division of Chemistry, Professor Chekmenev at Wayne State University (WSU) is implementing a closed helium recovery system to sustain three shared research Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) instruments, one teaching NMR instrument, and a 7-Tesla Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer (FT-ICR MS). The instruments are used to identify and characterize molecules and are essential research tools. These instruments utilize high-field superconducting magnets that require liquid helium to maintain their fields. There is a global shortage of helium \u2013 a non-renewable natural resource \u2013 which has negatively impacted our ability to maintain these magnets. The helium recovery system will mitigate resulting uncertainty, enabling continuation of WSU research at the forefront of science in the fields of synthetic chemistry, biological chemistry, catalysis, food science, biomedical sciences and technology, microelectronics/sensing, and biomaterials.\r\n\r\nA closed-loop system will capture helium from the superconducting magnets associated with the NMR and mass spectrometry instruments in the WSU chemistry department facility. The collected gas will be  temporarily stored in medium-pressure tanks before being liquified at a centralized station and then transferred to a separate mobile Dewar receptacle to be used for magnet fills. the recovery rate will be monitored and reported to NSF.  A high rate of recovery is expected.  The ability to recycle precious He to sustain the NMR and MS instruments at WSU Chemistry will help drive the recruitment and training of a diverse group of students as an integral part of the research and teaching missions of the department .\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
