 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides travel support to enable selected graduate students and junior researchers, especially those from under-represented groups, to attend the Dynamic Traffic Assignment Conference (DTA 2023), Evanston, Illinois, 10-12 July 2023. The Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) series of symposia aims to foster excellence in dynamic traffic assignment research and practice and provide a forum for exchanging innovative ideas and challenges on DTA and related transportation science problems. It helps bring together those working at the cutting edge of the field, exchange their results, discuss research issues, and identify future directions, with a goal of encouraging participation of both junior and senior researchers. To achieve this, a goal of the DTA 2023 is to keep the cost of attending as low as possible to encourage participation of underrepresented and minority students, and junior researchers. This award will help accomplish that goal.\r\n\r\nThe grant will encourage broader attendance at DTA 2023. The funding will provide travel support to approximately 20 graduate students and junior researchers, especially those from under-represented groups to present papers or extended abstracts and participate in discussions. These travel grants will be awarded through a competitive process and thus receipt of these travel support will be considered an honor by the recipients. The presentation sessions have been well attended in the past and provide students with an opportunity to network with senior researchers in the field from both industry and academia as well as to highlight their own ongoing work, further enhancing career opportunities and building the Engineering workforce. The conference has historically been a fertile ground for students and junior researchers' professional development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
