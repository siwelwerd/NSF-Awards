 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact potential of this I-Corps project is a novel approach for the treatment of oral inflammatory and ulcerative diseases in dogs and cats. As the biggest challenge with inflammatory dental disease treatment lies in biofilm reduction, anti-viral mechanisms, immune system modulation, and reduction of inflammation, our solution tackles it all with economically feasible, easy to use, and efficient technology. This innovation will stimulate stem cells to grow and promote wound healing of damaged tissue by maintaining gingival mesenchymal stem cells homeostasis. This novel approach for Feline chronic gingivostomatitis treatment with the application of Lactic Acid Bacteria-derived metabolites and exosomes combined with organic zinc nanoparticles and hydrogel in a formulation.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of treatment of periodontal disease, which is the most common infectious condition in adult dogs and cats. It is a progressive, cyclical inflammatory disease of the supporting structures of the tooth and is the main cause of dental disease and early tooth loss in both species. It affects over 87% of dogs and 70% of cats over three years of age. This novel approach uses a hydrogel enriched with paraprobiotics (non-infectious microbial cell components such as peptidoglycans, teichoic acids, surface proteins, etc.) and lactic acid bacteria probiotics derived biomolecules, so-called postbiotics (exosomes, enzymes, secreted proteins, short chain fatty acids, vitamins, secreted biosurfactants, amino acids, peptides, organic acids, etc.) enhanced with biologically produced zinc oxide nanoparticles. This technology will help cats by reducing inflammation, dental plaque, chronic pain, promoting tissue and cell regeneration, treating viral infection, and improving wound healing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
