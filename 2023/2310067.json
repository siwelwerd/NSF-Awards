 "awd_abstract_narration": "Half a century of experimental investigations into the proton's internal structure have provided remarkable insight into the dynamics of the quarks and gluons making up the particle. However, many outstanding questions remain. Even the most fundamental aspect, the origin of the mass of nuclei, is uncertain.  To date, the most visible mass of the universe, as well as a complete description of how quarks are confined into composite particles remain outside our current understanding. The PI and her Duquesne undergraduate students will investigate the origin of the spin of the proton through its fundamental constituents, using electron beams at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.  \r\n\r\nThis award supports the PI and Duquesne undergraduate students in research aiming to study the structure of the proton through its partonic distributions using polarized electron scattering in the deep inelastic scattering regime in Hall B at Jefferson lab. These measurements will help understand the origin of single hadron formation inside the proton. Combined with additional measurements on deuterium targets, the PI will be able to probe the strangeness contribution to the structure of the nucleon through its partonic distribution using charged kaon and pion detection. The Duquesne group will participate in monitoring and maintaining the software for two hybrid Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detectors that are important for particle identification. Software development and Physics data analysis will be performed at Duquesne, while electronics testing and other hardware projects will be performed at Jefferson lab. This project will provide undergraduate students with opportunities to further their training and education outside of the classroom. This includes gaining experience in the design, assembly, and testing of modern particle Physics detectors, high tech fast electronics, and scientific data analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
