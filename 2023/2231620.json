 "awd_abstract_narration": "Internet of Things devices \u2013 more than 43 billion in use \u2013 make our lives easier. Today\u2019s devices mostly watch, collect, and transmit data to be analyzed elsewhere. The IDEAS Center will drive current technology to enable devices to analyze the data, learn from data, make decisions, and act on those decisions in coordination with other devices. These smarter devices will revolutionize every aspect of life: healthcare, infrastructure, agriculture, e-commerce, transportation, microelectronics, manufacturing, entertainment, aerospace, and many more. IDEAS will collaborate with companies in all these industries to improve their business practices and provide them with employees trained in these technologies.\r\n\r\nIDEAS\u2019 work, \u201cIntelligent, Distributed, Embedded Applications and Systems,\u201d addresses fundamental challenges as the present two-layer structure of the internet (user-end devices at one end and data centers at the other), evolves into a massive, distributed network of computers that will provide computing as a service. Companies in critical industries must exploit possible emerging opportunities as IoT, edge-cloud infrastructure, 5G communications, microelectronics, and intelligent computing converge. ASU-IDEAS will focus on domain-specific robotics, hardware-software codesign of AI/ML accelerators at the edge, intelligent sensors at the edge, and design of distributed edge-cloud computing systems \u2013 all targeting extreme energy efficiency for sustainable computing. \r\n\r\nIDEAS\u2019 technologies will help make access to data, information, and decision-making through computers as pervasive and commonplace as roads, public transportation, hospitals, and other public services that are part and parcel of our daily lives. The technology will also be extremely energy efficient so that businesses can not only radically improve their operating efficiency, but also make their enterprises more environmentally sustainable. IDEAS will train future engineers and scientists from all segments of society to further advance these technologies. Collaborative mentoring will promote entrepreneurial research among the students to foster the next generation of ground-breaking discoveries.\r\n\r\nIDEAS will build and maintain a single Center-wide data repository. It will be maintained for IUCRC Phase I and for any subsequent years of center operation. It will be developed following IUCRC best practices for securing, documenting, and reporting data. While initially it will be cloud-based, we will integrate any physical infrastructure requirements such as servers or other hardware as needed. Strong password protection and duo-authentication properties will be integrated as needed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
