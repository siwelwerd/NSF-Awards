 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports participation of graduate students and postdocs to attend Midwest Numerical Analysis Day (MWNADay) at Iowa State University on April 29, 2023.  MWNADay is a small regional conference held annually in the Midwest and it typically attracts 60-80 participants.  The intent of the conference series is to offer a platform for computational and applied mathematicians in the Midwest to gather and exchange research ideas. This conference will offer a forum for researchers at all stages of their careers to exchange ideas in numerical analysis, scientific computing, and related application areas with the goal of growing regional interest in computational mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe focus of MWNADay 2023 at Iowa State will be on mathematical and computational methods in the context of physical and data sciences. Topics of interest include but are not limited to high-order numerical PDEs, interface problems, numerical gradient flows, scientific machine learning, and optimal control in data science. Three plenary talks will be given by leaders in the field, and there will be mini-symposium sessions comprised of a mixture of talks given by faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students from universities in the Midwest region. This meeting provides a unique opportunity for in-depth technical discussions, exchange of ideas, and exploration of new collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
