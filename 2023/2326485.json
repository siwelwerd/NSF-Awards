 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies have shown that medical devices can be less accurate for patients with darker versus lighter skin. This problem can negatively affect the ability of doctors to make correct decisions about how to treat these patients, leading to worse health outcomes for patients with darker skin. Most experts believe that the primary cause of this effect is the absorption of light by melanin in the top layer of the skin. There are wide variations in the amount of melanin in the skin among the population. Instruments called melanometers can measure variables related to the amount of melanin in the skin. Using data from melanometers may help to properly account for the effect of melanin on the accuracy of medical devices in diverse populations. This proposal will develop materials that mimic skin with different amounts of melanin and blood and measure these materials with melanometers to better understand the effects of melanin and blood on the data obtained with melanometers. This project may lead to improved methods for making sure that medical devices are safe and effective for patients of all races and skin types. Results of this project will be incorporated into courses at the University of California Irvine on identifying disparities in health outcomes to illustrate how technologies can be developed and validated in a way that is equally accurate across diverse groups of patients.\r\n\r\nEnsuring robustness of biophotonic technologies across the full range of skin colors is crucial for healthcare equity in clinical environments and personal health monitoring settings. Over the past two decades, numerous studies have identified racial disparities in biophotonic devices, from cerebral oximeters to photoacoustic imagers. These discrepancies can adversely impact clinical decision making, leading to worse health outcomes for patients with darker skin. Most experts believe that the primary cause of this effect is the intense, spectrally varying absorption of epidermal melanin; the concentration of which varies considerably across the population. To determine the magnitude of impact on a device, one must accurately determine the correlation between melanin content and device outputs/accuracy. Prior studies have used subjective methods, including self-identification of race and the Fitzpatrick phototype scale to assess subject pigmentation. However, objective, quantitative, and well-standardized methods based on optical measurements may provide a more precise and effective way to isolate the impact of epidermal melanin. The PI and collaborators will pursue this goal via constructing a rigorous set of synthetic tissue-simulating phantoms and using these phantoms as calibration standards to systematically characterize commercial (non-FDA-approved/cleared) melanometers for measuring skin pigmentation. Validating the outputs of these commercial devices against a well-characterized set of tissue models that simulate both melanin content and confounding tissue factors (e.g., hemoglobin, tissue scattering) will provide a critical fundamental step forward in establishing the credibility of melanometers as regulatory science tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
