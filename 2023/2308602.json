 "awd_abstract_narration": "Einstein's General Relativity and quantum physics are the currently accepted theories describing physics across the universe.  General Relativity is a comprehensive description of observed gravitational phenomena on scales ranging from micrometers to the size of the visible universe.  Quantum physics describes, to a high degree of precision, the molecular, atomic and subatomic regime.  Despite the success, unresolved questions remain in cosmology and quantum gravity, and so physicists worldwide conjecture that the two theories are merged in some unknown unified theory.  Recent scientific literature reveals that experiments and observation could possibly find violations in the foundations of General Relativity theory.  Such foundational principles include the notion of spacetime symmetry.  For example, local experiments should not favor any special direction in space, according to General Relativity.  However, models of quantum gravity suggest that this principle may be broken in a miniscule but detectable way.  The work supported by this award involves theoretical calculations of signals for spacetime symmetry breaking in experiments and observations.  The focus will be on using astrophysical phenomena like black holes and gravitational waves.  One of the important aspects of this award is financial support for undergraduate research in theory.  This has the impactful feature of not only assisting the PI in the work, but also giving research experience to students, thus contributing to their education and increasing the likelihood of future STEM careers.  Outreach opportunities by the PI and students are also supported.\r\n\r\nThe work in this award on tests of the foundations of General Relativity will use a broad test framework, based on effective field theory.  Signals for spacetime-symmetry violations, like local Lorentz violation and diffeomorphism symmetry violation, will be calculated for black holes and gravitational waves.  Within the effective field theory framework, strong-field gravity solutions for the spacetime metric for black holes, modified by generic spacetime-symmetry violation, will be constructed, representing a new step forward in this area.  Modification to gravitational wave generation is to be studied, complementing existing analysis on propagation effects.  The work is closely tied to finding specific observables that can be tested against experiments and observations.  Thus, the award supports theoretical work that will provide motivation and additional areas in which to search for new physics beyond General Relativity, in particular, in gravitational wave observations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nPresently, the physical laws of nature are described by Einstein's General Relativity (GR) and the Standard Model of particle physics, the latter based in part on quantum theory. However, quantum theory has not yet been meshed with GR and scientists conjecture the existence of a theory of everything that would unify GR with quantum theory.\n\n\nTo find evidence of a unified theory is challenging. One approach of late is to identify possible features of a unified theory that could be detected in sensitive observations and experiments. Indeed, fundamental principles of GR such as local Lorentz invariance could be violated in various approaches to a unified theory, like quantum gravity and string theory.\n\n\nIn this project, the PI calculated signals for Lorentz invariance violation that can be measured in sensitive observations using data collected by the LIGO-VIRGO gravitational wave collaboration. This work used a general framework that describes hypothetical Lorentz invariance violation for gravity and matter. Specifically, the PI, undergraduate students supported by the grant, and international collaborators published an article on gravitational wave tests of GR, completed work on another GW article, and made significant progress in a study of black hole solutions.\n\n\nFirst, the published article (in the journal Annals of Physics) on gravitational waves is a new analysis studying so-called wave generation for gravitational waves. This amounts to determining the effects of the source for gravitational waves (such as binary black holes and neutron stars) on the measurements by instruments on Earth (interferometers). The PI and collaborators found that the signals of Local Lorentz violation would manifest as extra polarizations gravitational waves. In other words, this would make the arms of the inteferometers on Earth oscillate in different ways compared to the predictions of Einsteins GR. Further they showed that these effects would depend on sky location (anisotropy).\n\n\nSecond, the PI and collaborators completed (currently under submission) a related project on gravitational wave signals for a different form of hypothetical Lorentz violation called explicit breaking. They showed in this work that such a form of Lorentz violation may be ruled out by experiment already. Finally, this grant supported the PI and undergraduates to embark on a study of black hole solutions and their modifications due to Lorentz violation; a work in progress.\n\n\nImpacts of the proposal also include mentoring undergraduate students (including a female student - underrepresented in physics). This student gave two presentations on their work at conferences to a mostly graduate student and faculty audience. Another student co-author has graduated and is now working in STEM-related industry. Yet another undergraduate is in training to contribute to the black hole project.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/27/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: QuentinGBailey\n"
