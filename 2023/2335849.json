 "awd_abstract_narration": "In alignment with national goals to broaden participation in science and engineering, the University of Hawaii will lead a workshop to prepare researchers in the region to develop high-quality and competitive proposals that meet the expectations of the National Science Foundation Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Core Programs. The workshop will support researchers at minority-serving institutions (MSIs) across Hawaii and Guam to build skills to increase the number of competitive proposals developed and submitted to the NSF CISE Core Programs. The workshop will foster interdisciplinary collaboration by bringing together researchers from different information science-related programs and disciplines within the region. \r\n\r\nWorkshop attendees will include both aspiring PIs and senior research mentors. The workshop will be structured to facilitate information sharing, as well as networking among participants. Aspiring PIs will be matched with mentors who will advise on proposal development during and after the workshop. Key information will be shared via mentors\u2019 plenary presentations and panel discussions. Breakout sessions with mentors will be scheduled to facilitate peer connections and gain feedback on proposal elements. Workshop content will include the NSF proposal development process; identifying relevant CISE Core Programs; the NSF merit review criteria and specific program solicitations; key components of a competitive proposal; the proposal review process; ethics of research; and dissemination of results. The workshop will provide mentorship and networking opportunities to strengthen researchers\u2019 careers and the long-term sustainability of the University of Hawaii System's and other regional universities\u2019 research activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
