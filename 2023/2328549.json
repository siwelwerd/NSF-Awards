 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Solar Wind Conference series is a triennial event that brings experts from around the world to discuss the latest research and advancements in the field of solar wind physics and the connections between the solar wind and other space-environments. Over the past fifty years, the conference has grown in size and scope, attracting scientists from a wide range of disciplines, including solar physics, heliophysics, space physics, and planetary science. The conference has also evolved to include sessions on cutting-edge topics such as solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and space weather, providing opportunities for interdisciplinary interactions between professionals working on various aspects of space physics research.  This project supports students and young scientists to attend the 16th International Solar Wind Conference Series to be held June 12-16, 2023 in Asilomar, California. \r\n\r\nThe Solar Wind 16 conference has compiled a diverse set of selected topics that comprehensively cover the vast field of space physics and solar wind science. The conference brings together experts and researchers from various disciplines to discuss and present the latest advancements and research findings in the field. From the origin and acceleration of the solar wind to its impact on the heliosphere and planetary environments, the selected topics encompass a wide range of themes that reflect the multidisciplinary nature of the field. The chosen topics promise to foster engaging discussions and collaborations among the attendees and contribute to the advancement of space physics research. The topics and proposed sessions are: i. Fundamentals of Solar Wind Physics; ii. Heating and Acceleration of the solar wind ; iii. Solar Wind Interactions; and iv. The \u201cBig Picture\u201d. The NSF funds will be distributed among students and early career scientists as stipends to cover their registration, lodging and/or travel expenses. This budget will allow for a significant number of students and young scientists to attend the conference, providing them with the opportunity to present their research, network with their peers, and learn from established experts in the field. This investment in the next generation of scientists will help to ensure the continued growth and success of the solar wind research community and additionally provide an opportunity to support diversity and inclusivity within this community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
