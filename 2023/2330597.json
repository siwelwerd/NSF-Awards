 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to empower and amplify the voices of Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) youth in building disaster resilience within their communities. By developing a curriculum, this project aims to provide middle school youth with the knowledge, skills, and tools to address environmental justice issues related to disasters. This innovative approach fosters civic engagement, data literacy, and critical thinking among youth, equipping them to become active agents of change. The project's broader significance lies in its potential to assist youth in becoming resilient and socially conscious individuals who can tackle complex challenges in their communities. Through the curriculum, youth participants gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between disasters, climate change, and social equity. They learn about green and grey infrastructure solutions, data visualization techniques, and youth advocacy strategies. By engaging in hands-on activities and developing action plans, youth not only enhance their scientific and technological understanding but also cultivate leadership skills and build networks within their communities. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a curriculum and an open-source mapping tool, which addresses a crucial problem: the lack of representation and empowerment of youth in disaster resilience efforts. Traditionally, these youth have been marginalized and their perspectives overlooked in community planning and decision-making processes related to disasters. The opportunity lies in harnessing the potential of youth to contribute meaningfully to resilience and foster social equity. The innovation of the curriculum lies in its interdisciplinary approach, integrating elements of environmental justice, data visualization, and youth advocacy. By combining these components, this project aims to equip youth with the knowledge and skills to understand the relationship between disasters, climate change, and social equity, and empower them to advocate for change within their communities. The curriculum encourages critical thinking, civic engagement, and the development of action plans, enabling youth to become catalysts for resilience and community-driven solutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
