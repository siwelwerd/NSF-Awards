 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte engages a diverse group of 10 undergraduate students each summer in an intensive 9-week research experience. The Site research theme of Smart and Secure Future Computing engages students in interdisciplinary research focusing on applications in cutting edge domains such as smart homes, transportation, healthcare, and other advanced systems. The goals of the REU Site program experience are to develop students\u2019 research skills and confidence through exposure and training in interdisciplinary research in the focus areas of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. To achieve these goals, the REU participants work together with faculty, graduate students, and peers on research projects. Research project work provides participants with a firsthand opportunity to apply and expand their knowledge, to better understand the societal and global impacts of research, to bring these experiences back to their home institutions and to apply lessons learned to contribute to cutting-edge computing applications. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this REU Site is to create a collaborative community that supports and engages a diverse group of undergraduate students in research to advance the state of the art in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. The REU Site mentoring approach aims to cultivate a community of learning through regular training in research skills; tiered mentoring of faculty, graduate students, and peers; and communicating and sharing research results. The UNC Charlotte REU Site emphasizes participation of promising students from underrepresented groups in computing and from institutions that have limited research programs. Undergraduate students are recruited from throughout the region and country to participate in the program. This experience will further prepare students for graduate school and computing research, and improve their perceptions of computing as a career, all while contributing to research projects in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
