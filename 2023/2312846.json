 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to provide support for students to attend the University of California, Irvine intensive combustion summer school.  As part of this UCI Combustion Institute Summer School (UCI CI-SS), graduate students will be exposed to comprehensive curriculum that includes both professional lectures in classrooms and in laboratory environment. The UCI CI-SS is targeted to follow the best practices for diversity and inclusiveness from the summer school participants and lecturers, particularly selecting well-established experts in the field from traditionally underrepresented minorities as role models. The summer school is designed to provide significant opportunity for participants to interact with their peers within the five-day long residential program. The program consists primarily of eight distinguished professional lectures covering from existing methods to those being developed for future applications. The tentative program will be held from August 20 through 25, 2023. \r\n\r\nThe UC Irvine Summer School (UCI CI-SS) offers the opportunity to bridge not only the combustion science from past to present but also extends beyond the known conventional approaches. The UCI CI-SS includes three critical distinguishing features comprising: (1) a detailed introduction to experimental combustion methods to better understand combustion physics, (2) state-of-the art combustion diagnostics through hands on experimentation, and (3) uncertainty quantification and comparison with numerical predictions. A true commitment to access, diversity, equity, and inclusion (ADEI) aspects will be followed throughout the course.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
