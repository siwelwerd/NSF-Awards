 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI), and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) programs in response to the solicitation of proposals that promote the recovery, recycle, and/or reuse of helium. North Carolina State University is acquiring a helium recovery system to capture and reliquefy helium from eight NMR spectrometers which support the research of Xiaoyan Sun along with colleagues Peter Thompson, and Joseph Barycki. This equipment supports research in the areas of chemistry, biology, biochemistry, and materials science.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. Using the intrinsic magnetic properties of atomic nuclei, it is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The superconducting magnets of these instruments rely on regular deliveries of liquid helium to maintain their operation. However, the instability in the helium supply due to global and national challenges jeopardizes research programs relying on NMR spectroscopy. This helium recovery system collects the helium boiloff from the superconducting magnets and then reliquefies the helium for its reuse. This equipment also supports the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students, including undergraduates from groups underrepresented in STEM, at all levels in multiple departments and the surrounding community. The equipment aids in stabilizing the helium supply in the region by sharing recovered helium with neighboring institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award is aimed at supporting research and education at all levels. Specifically, this helium recovery system collects the helium boiloff for reliquefication and reuse from the superconducting magnets thereby stabilizing the operation of the institution\u2019s eight NMR spectrometers. The NMR instrumentation supported by this equipment enables research projects including those focused on studying the effects of coherent electronic motions occurring in energy and electron transfer in classes of multi-chromophoric synthetic platforms. The recovery system aids in supporting the investigation of temperature and concentration dependent characteristics of pre-crystallizing solutions.  Additionally, the acquisition of this equipment supports the characterization of free base and iron chelates and designer paramagnetic ligands in donor-bridge-acceptor biradical complexes.  Other research projects supported by this equipment include the synthesis and use of N-aryl peptides as novel precursors for peptide ligation reactions and the ability to probe the changes in dehaloperoxidase dynamics as a function of substrate binding and type.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
