 "awd_abstract_narration": "The magnetosphere is a leading source of auroral energy and momentum transport within the high-latitude thermosphere. Winds at these so-called 'meso' scales play a crucial role in the transport processes, yet have never been systematically characterized due to lack of observations. The PIs will statistically catalog mesoscale F-region (150-600 km above Earth?s surface) wind occurrences, structure and evolution. The proposed efforts leverage substantial NSF assets to lay the ground for inferring winds from auroral morphology. This work will inform efforts to model magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere interaction at mesoscales. Its broader impacts include support for young scientists and a female postdoc, and publicizing auroral events. \r\n\r\nThe team will categorize mesoscale winds according to different auroral arcs and geomagnetic and solar conditions. They will synergize European satellite wind data with several datasets that are closely spaced and/or observe common volumes over Alaska and western Canada. The spatial scales and direction of thermospheric winds provide information on underlying forcing, and serve as indicators of the efficiency of ionosphere-thermosphere coupling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
