 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of new materials with unique properties is the foundation for new energy and information technologies. Despite tremendous progress in developing such materials, scientists still seek to understand how the fundamental physical properties are governed by the chemistry of multifunctional materials. This project aims to establish a strong research program in advanced materials design and development at Clemson University (CU) with the goal of addressing these fundamental challenges to create novel systems with multiple functionalities. The project will design, synthesize, and characterize new materials to develop deeper understanding of how the fundamentals such as chemical composition, atomic structure, and bonding determine optical and magnetic properties. This work will be performed in partnership with researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) \u2013 a world-class neutron facility. The extensive collaboration between CU and ORNL will advance frontier, transdisciplinary study of multifunctional systems in physics and chemistry while educating undergraduate and graduate students about the connection between the science and practice of advanced materials research. \r\n\r\nThis Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-4 EPSCoR Research Fellows (RII Track-4) project would provide a fellowship to an Assistant professor and training for a graduate student at the Clemson University. This work would be conducted in collaboration with researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Optically addressable lanthanide magnets are at the forefront of new technological advances in quantum information science and spintronics. While impressive achievements have been made in the study of lanthanide (Ln) single molecular magnets, a significant challenge awaits as to how luminescence and magnetism can be harmonized in extended solid Ln materials. The goal of this EPSCoR project is to provide a reliable set of fundamental chemistry\u2013function guidelines in new Ln3+ materials, resulting in optimal electron\u2013phonon interactions, spin states, and coupled degrees of freedom favorable to the co-existence of luminescence and magnetism in a single system. The proposed research adopts a combined experimental approach using state-of-the-art synthetic techniques, photoluminescent and magnetic properties measurements, X-ray diffraction, and neutron scattering. This project will enable the PI to develop a long-term collaboration between CU and ORNL, which in turn will enhance the cross-disciplinary research activities, expertise, and education for the PI\u2019s research team and CU, and thus facilitate the scientific advancement, workforce development, and economic growth in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
