 "awd_abstract_narration": "Montana State University\u2019s (MSU) research translation activity in terms of invention disclosures, patents filed, and US patents issued has lagged behind the nation when compared to 0its strong and growing fundamental research portfolio. MSU\u2019s unmet research translation potential is an especially pressing concern given that it serves the low-population, historically under-resourced, and geographically isolated state of Montana. This Accelerating Research Translation project will work to overcome these hurdles and capitalize on the promise of translational activities and university-industry partnerships to advance STEM research capacities, infrastructure, pipelines, and workforce; spur economic development; and address diverse community needs in an under-served region of the United States. The project\u2019s main goals are to 1) build on the university\u2019s land-grant mission and culture of societal problem-solving with entrepreneurship and research translation as added core values; 2) increase research translation capacities through sustainable programs and support; and 3) elevate MSU\u2019s levels of research translation in line with its very high research activity. By improving the rate of research translating to practice, and by broadening participation of underrepresented minorities in research translation, this project will contribute to improvements in economic competitiveness and societal well-being while sustaining research excellence at MSU. \r\n\r\nExpected outcomes, including a more diverse and energized community of students, staff, and researchers who value and pursue translational activities of direct benefit to society, will be accomplished via an integrated mix of innovative and inclusive training, support, and partnerships. A design thinking program will combine with an entrepreneurship curriculum to teach use-inspired approaches and co-produce culturally and geographically relevant translational research and solutions. A comprehensive suite of support will advance high-potential, high-impact research translation in the form of Seed Translational Research Projects (STRP) and encourage university spinout companies at greater rates. Local and regional partnerships with ART ambassadors and the University of Washington will promote research facilitation champions on campus, facilitate multi-institutional exchanges of ideas and best practices, provide mentorship, and allow access to well-established entrepreneurship and spinout services. These synergistic activities will be tailored to regional contexts and needs, and will prioritize inclusivity and diversity, with particular attention to Montana\u2019s rural and Tribal communities. \r\n\r\nThe project is partially supported by NSF\u2019s Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
