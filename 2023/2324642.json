 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strengthening American Infrastructure (SAI) is an NSF Program seeking to stimulate human-centered fundamental and potentially transformative research that strengthens America\u2019s infrastructure. Effective infrastructure provides a strong foundation for socioeconomic vitality and broad quality of life improvement. Strong, reliable, and effective infrastructure spurs private-sector innovation, grows the economy, creates jobs, makes public-sector service provision more efficient, strengthens communities, promotes equal opportunity, protects the natural environment, enhances national security, and fuels American leadership. To achieve these goals requires expertise from across the science and engineering disciplines. SAI focuses on how knowledge of human reasoning and decision-making, governance, and social and cultural processes enables the building and maintenance of effective infrastructure that improves lives and society and builds on advances in technology and engineering.\r\n\r\nMore than half of the human population is concentrated in urban areas. This worldwide shift from rural to urban living is likely to continue. Although urbanization creates opportunities to support human health and well-being, it also introduces serious threats. Compared to suburban and rural environments, urban living provides easier access to social infrastructure \u2013 the public spaces where people interact socially and engage with the community.  Yet, exposure to urban versus natural environments is associated with poorer physical and psychological well-being. One key to understanding these differences is to recognize that not all urban public spaces are created the same. Stark differences exist within cities in the qualities of urban and natural public spaces, and the different opportunities that these public spaces provide. With the input of community partners, this multidisciplinary project uses online, laboratory, and community-based data collection to understand the impact of public spaces on cognition, emotion, and well-being, and to document the lived experiences of marginalized and non-marginalized community members. This SAI research project strengthens America\u2019s social infrastructure by identifying features of public spaces that promote restoration and well-being, and by providing evidence-based design standards for healthy and equitable public spaces.\r\n\r\nThis project explores responses to public spaces among diverse residents in three U.S. cities. The project leverages a mixed-methods approach, using qualitative indicators and quantitative data from surveys and experiments. The quantitative assessments include physiological reactivity data, behavioral eye tracking and motion tracking data, self-report data, and archival neighborhood-level data. These methods are used to identify features of public spaces that are associated with psychological restoration and well-being, and to document similarities and differences in the experiences of marginalized and non-marginalized individuals. Findings are regularly shared with an advisory board with representation from a variety of organizations that promote public spaces, including cultural institutions, policy groups, educational initiatives and community groups. The data and the expertise of advisors are incorporated into the development of a social impact protocol for assessing and designing healthier and more equitable public spaces.\r\n\r\nThis award is supported by the Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic (SBE) Sciences and the Directorate for Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
