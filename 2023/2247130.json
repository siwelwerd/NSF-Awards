 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award will provide partial support for U.S.-based participants to attend the 2023 installment of the Canadian Operator Symposium (COSy), to take place May 15-19, 2023, on the campus of the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, Canada.  This international conference, which is regularly attended by U.S.-based mathematicians, will bring together leading experts from around the world to discuss important new developments in the field and provide opportunities for mathematicians at all career stages to present their work and propose directions for future research.  The award will provide US-based early-career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not otherwise funded by NSF the opportunity to participate in the conference.  \r\n\r\nCOSy was established in 1972 as a conference focused on operator theory, operator algebras, and applications and is now the premier annual conference in Canada devoted to these themes.  This year\u2019s program is anchored by a lecture series on quantum information theory, and will include 10-20 fifty-minute plenary lectures, as well as approximately 30 contributed talks by researchers spanning a variety of mathematical areas.  Topics will include several areas of active current interest in operator algebras, emphasizing recent developments and emerging directions in the structure theory of von Neumann algebras; subfactors and fusion categories; the classification of amenable C*-algebras; noncommutative geometry; and connections between operator algebras and dynamics, logic, set theory, and quantum information theory.  Additional details are available at http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/22-23/COsy2023.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
