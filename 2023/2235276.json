 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical description:\r\nTo deploy photons for real-world quantum technologies, it is essential to develop integrated photonic circuits consisting of various quantum photonic devices based on modern semiconductor materials with desired light emission, modulation, and detection properties. In this teaming project, a multidisciplinary team of researchers with combined expertise in materials, devices, and circuits explores a holistic, co-design approach toward this goal. The team investigates the quantum defects in two-dimensional materials for the emission of circularly polarized single photons. Further, the team explores strategies of synthesizing and simulating quantum photonic circuits while considering physical device limitations. The team conducts preliminary co-design research, initiates multidisciplinary curriculum development, and organizes three workshops by inviting researchers from academia and industry, particularly those from underrepresented groups, and students and educators, including those from local community colleges. Hence, the team can build capacity and develop communities and partnerships for future large research projects and semiconductor workforce development activities. \r\n\r\nTechnical description:\r\nThis teaming project consists of two co-design research explorations. The first co-design research explores the development of efficient chiral quantum light-matter interactions by co-optimizing defect single photon emission from two-dimensional material based heterostructures and manufacturable integrated photonic components. The second co-design research explores the development of resource-efficient integrated quantum photonic circuit synthesis that considers physical photonic devices limitations. A workshop on quantum materials is held at the University at Buffalo and two workshops on photonic devices and circuits are held at the University of Utah. Through the broad participation of researchers, educators, and students, these workshops facilitate the development of research plans and broad collaborations for future large research and education projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
