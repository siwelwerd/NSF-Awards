 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of technology that provides objective data to patients and caregivers before and after clinical psychological consults to provide improved adherence and to improve the informal support infrastructure for new referrals to a clinical psychologist. Mental health disorders are prevalent in the United States, with nearly one in four adults living with a mental illness. Mental health disorders account for a large proportion of the disease burden in younger populations across the world. While mental health disorders are often diagnosed in adulthood, these diseases often stem from disorders arising as a childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood. Social and health disparities have a widespread impact on developmental periods and have been associated with an increase in mental health conditions in racial minorities. Furthermore, with increased social isolation, increased depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stress become more prevalent, particularly in females. For young adults, in college or professional programs, the need to balance life and work already present significant challenges for emotional wellbeing, let alone when faced with a pandemic.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a technology that integrates personalized, wearable devices and machine learning/artificial intelligence frameworks to establish a personalized evaluation and intervention targeting mental health changes in stressful environments. Wearable sensors enable continuous measurement and evaluation of potential behavioral markers of disease progression, physiological health, and wellness in adults across their lifespan. Given the shortage of mental health professionals, limited access to quality mental health services, and the stigma associated with mental disorders, the need for improved tele-monitoring of changes in health and wellness is paramount. Wearable sensors of physiological or psychological function have been integrated into accessories, clothing, body attachments, and implantable devices. However, fitness trackers and smartwatches experience abandonment rates of ~30%, which highlights the need to develop technologies that are user\u2010centered and respond to users\u2019 functional and emotional needs to ensure adoption and continued use.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Wearable intelligent sensors, in particular, enable continuous measurement and evaluation of potential behavioral markers of disease progression, physiological health, and wellness. Wearables which furthermore use utilize monitored data (based on modern machine learning and AI) to suggest more active intervention promise a generational advancement. Both personalization and security/privacy can address needs and concerns of medical practioners, patients, and caregivers.\n\n\n\n\nThis I-Corps project was focused on understanding the commercial needs, industry constraints, and patient/caregiver concerns concerning using wearables for mental health issues. Two groups, young adults, and veterans, were of particular interest. Young adults are particularly under stress during social and physical developmental periods, and significant numbers of veterans suffer from mental health problems after returning from deployment. In the case of young adults, families often acutely concerned about triggers of mental health episodes and strategies for managing such possible triggers. This is particularly important due to the potential long-term ramifications of mental health problems in youth. In the case of veterans, a number of formal and informal support groups exist to help veterans with mental health issues. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a group with specific focus on mental health and a mobile app to assist in broadly understanding issues of mental health. For both young adults and veterans, various social stigmas and cultural practices influence how patients and caregivers approach mental health professionals.\n\n\n\n\nWe found the questions concerting commercialization of mental health wearables to be complex, notwithstanding the almost universal appreciation of the promise of such technologies. Data privacy and anonymity were a cause of acute concern. The community of medical professionals would want validated performance results comparable to success of in-person care before supporting broad adoption of remote care technologies. Mobile apps are now a commodity, but wearable technologies would represent a significant upsell. It was also not clear whether health professionals, parients, or caregivers would form the primary customer market for wearables focused on mental health. In the case of veterans, it was also not clear how commercializability would interact with existing VA efforts.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/15/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RichardSowers\n"
