 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by utilizing experiential and innovative research in forensic science to increase student engagement and success in STEM. The Forensic Science Research Center at California State University East Bay is uniquely positioned to enable undergraduate students to gain experience, knowledge, and skills in forensic science required for most entry-level forensic science positions. California State University East Bay is a Hispanic-Serving Institution and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution, where most students identify as first-generation college students. The project goals are to engage diverse undergraduate students in forensic science and investigations through research with faculty and practitioners while providing the skillsets and experience needed for entry-level positions in forensic science and STEM. The project will also enhance partnerships with local criminal justice agencies to allow practitioners to work with students on research and create mentorship and networking opportunities. To create a continued interest and empower youth to consider STEM careers, students will also complete outreach to K-12 and community colleges through science fairs and community events promoting forensic science with age-appropriate experiments and hands-on activities. \r\n\r\nForensic science is a unique, intersectional field that requires background and education in multiple areas of sciences including criminal justice. Classroom-based training, alone, is often not enough to prepare students for entry-level careers, as research and experiential learning, if present, do not equate to a year of experience needed to be hired. This project will fill a current gap of practitioner-involved forensic science research by providing undergraduate student researchers with real case experience prior to graduation. Twelve undergraduate student researchers will be exposed to cold cases, forensic science related research, conference attendance, and academic publications to ensure they are well-prepared for future careers or graduate school, ultimately diversifying the forensic science workforce and reducing evidence backlog. Evaluation of the project will include student success and retention of undergraduate student researchers, the expansion of institutional capacity to provide STEM education, the improvement of qualifications for students when entering the workforce, and the impact of outreach on enrollment to STEM majors. Foundational forensic science coursework will be developed for K-12 students that will be provided open-source to educators, allowing schools nationwide to incorporate vetted forensic science material into their classrooms. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. This project is also supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
