 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference grant will enable students to attend the Logic Mentoring Workshop (LMW 2023) which will be co-located with Computer Science Logic  (CSL) conference to be held in February in Warsaw, Poland.  CSL is the annual conference of the European Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL).  LMW seeks to introduce and mentor students who have already shown interest in logic and semantics research by bringing them to CSL so they can learn about current research problems, make connections with their contemporaries, and interact with leaders in the field.\r\n\r\nFunded students will benefit greatly from the opportunity to engage in the critical technical, professional, and social exchanges that both the conference and the workshop foster.  The LMW workshop will focus on mentoring and career advice to enable undergraduate and graduate students, and especially women, and underrepresented minorities to pursue and thrive in research careers both in logic/semantics specifically and in computer science generally.  This travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students.  Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school education for our society's future computer science researchers.  Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n* Scope of the Project\n\n\nThis project funded student attendance to two editions of the Logic Mentoring Workshop (LMW) organized in 2023. Both workshops are co-located with a flagship conference in logic in computer science: Computer Science Logic (CSL, in February in Warsaw, Poland) and Logic in Computer Science (LICS, in June in Boston, USA).\n\n\nThe LMW series is aimed at graduate and undergraduate students considering a career in research in theoretical computer science. The workshops consist in activities organized over one day, comprised of two-thirds invited talks by established researchers on topics ranging from current scientific topics to life as a researcher, and of one-third panel discussions. LMW also arranges for more direct and sustained interactions between the students, and organizes lunches and other exchanges with volunteer senior researchers throughout the main conference.\n\n\nA core mission of LMW is to support underrepresented groups in computer science. The invited speakers and panelists represent that mission, by having gender parity and cultural and socioeconomic diversity. This is reflected in the funding opportunities provided by LMW, which this NSF project contributed to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Outcome and Impact of the Project\n\n\nThanks to NSF funding, four (4) US-based students had their expenses covered to attend LMW and the main conference to which it was attached; two for LMW@CSL in February, two for LMW@LICS in June. Expenses included travel in economy class, reasonable subsistence costs, and conference fees.\n\n\nStudents reported that they \"probably\" would not have been able to attend without this grant. Self-reported demographic and identity traits indicate that one student was female and two were South Asian. A non-US-based student was sponsored using other funds for LMW@LICS, and identified as a queer Asian woman.\n\n\nEach workshop attracted 25 in-person participants on average. More than 50 students from a large array of countries showed interest in attending online and were provided with a Zoom link to attend LMW@CSL for free. The talks and panel received positive feedback from both the grantees and the attendees at large, who appreciated the openness and candid advice shared by the speakers and panelists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Looking forward\n\n\nThe LMW series will continue to be organized twice a year, co-located with CSL and LICS. The organization of the workshop is distributed over three people, usually a PhD student, a postdoctoral researcher, and a professor, offering a unique experience in workshop organizations for early-career researchers.\n\n\nLMW will continue to address the needs of underrepresented student populations by seeking support from organizations such as the NSF to offset the cost of attendance. The mission of LMW is more essential today than ever, especially since current PhD students have suffered through an interruption of in-person scientific interactions due to COVID-19.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/03/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MichaelCadilhac\n"
