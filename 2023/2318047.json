 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2024 Langenhop Lecture and SIU Mathematics Conference will be held May 16-17, 2024 at Southern Illinois University (SIU) at Carbondale, Illinois. The conference is devoted to the scientific and professional training of graduate students and young researchers. The SIU graduate students and recent graduates attend the conference to present their research, meet with their advisors and peers, and consult with senior mathematicians. This award will provide support to bring in more graduate students and post-docs from other schools. This will be especially beneficial for participants from smaller schools, such as SIU, which do not have many research groups and do not have funding for travel support for their graduate students. Finally, the conference contributes significantly to the research enthusiasm and engagement in the SIU School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe conference will cover a variety of topics in pure mathematics. The topics are related to the SIU faculty research areas and include automorphic forms, combinatorics, differential geometry, harmonic analysis, the Langlands program, Lie algebras, logic, number theory, partial differential equations, quadratic forms, and representation theory. Through the plenary lectures, the participants will learn about research directions in different areas of pure mathematics. The sessions will give the participants an opportunity to meet with specialists, present their work, discuss questions, and possibly start new collaborations. More information will be available on the conference website:  https://math.siu.edu/llmc2024/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
