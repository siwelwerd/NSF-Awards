 "awd_abstract_narration": "Living organisms can transform biominerals into exquisite shapes and sizes (e.g., diatoms, shells, bones, teeth, coral reefs) with material properties that cannot be mimicked in the lab.  Surprisingly little is known about the \u201crules\u201d of biomineralization. That it has evolved on Earth over 50 times indicates that different organisms have discovered their own ways to generate these molecules.  The proteins involved evolved independently but share some common features with one another thereby providing an opportunity to understand structure-function properties.  This work utilizes the favorable properties of a non-biomineralizing marine invertebrate (the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis) to understand the cellular and molecular aspects of biomineralization utilizing physical, chemical and biological approaches. A diverse team of scientists will test theories of biomineralization, and generate novel shapes and compounds. This knowledge will enable engineers to create novel compounds not seen in nature and generate structures from that could be used in areas from biomedicines to environmental engineering, thereby contributing to the bioeconomy. Biomineralization is a fascinating subject of interest students of all ages. Progress on this project will be incorporated into educational activities at Whitney, in Gainesville, and at the University of North Florida.\r\n\r\nThe process of biomineralization has evolved independently in numerous taxa. The \u201cintrinsically disordered proteins\u201d (IDPs) known to play a role in modulating the mineralization reaction are found in disparate taxa such as corals, echinoderms, sponges, and vertebrates, yet are not homologous thereby providing a unique opportunity to understand key structural and functional features of IDPs. The overarching goal is to develop a novel platform for examining biomineralization at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organismal levels of control. This platform is based on the soft bodied \"Starlet\" sea anemone,  Nematostella vectensis (Cnidaria, Anthozoa), which will be genetically programmed to secrete IDPs into designer matrices and compartments, enabling examination of their role in promoting non-classical mineralization processes involved in biomineralization. Integrated approaches enabled by our collaborative, interdisciplinary, and multi-institutional team include comparative and functional genomics, biochemistry and proteomics. Cellular engineering will identify how post translational modification of IDPs affect their interaction with scaffolding proteins and mineral precursor ions. This result will enable the study of cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions involved in creating the polarization needed for secretion of IDPs into controlled \u2018reaction spaces\u2019 and the structure and functional ability of these artificially-induced biomineral IDPs will be studied by monitoring the \u2018mineralogical signatures\u2019 created by mineral precursors and their interactions with the designer matrices. Finally, using genome editing techniques, we will attempt to engineer a soft bodied organism into one that produces components of a coral-like exoskeleton.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
