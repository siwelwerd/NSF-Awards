 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving undergraduate students\u2019 mindset beliefs, learning strategies, and persistence in gateway chemistry courses. Students\u2019 early success and skills learned in science gateway courses are integral to their success in completing science degrees. Research has reported that implementing the Growth Mindset (GM) or Effective Learning Strategies (ELS) interventions can improve student learning in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses. However, very few have studied the combination of these two related interventions.  This Level 1 Engaged Student Learning project will investigate the synergistic effects of two chemistry-based online modules (GM and ELS) implemented with students in introductory and general chemistry courses at two Hispanic Serving Institutions. The coupling of GM and ELS modules will explicitly teach students how to respond to challenges in specific contexts of the chemistry courses and adopt effective learning strategies necessary for improving their learning skills and academic success. The project is expected to produce online materials, including interactive videos and reflective writing activities, to teach GM and ELS in chemistry courses and advance understanding of coupling GM and ELS modules broadly in STEM curricula. The long term goals of the project include impacting students\u2019 mindset and learning skills, improving student success and retention in gateway chemistry courses, and improving diversity in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to develop two chemistry-based GM and ELS modules for the introductory and general chemistry courses in two institutions, and to examine their effectiveness using a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Student participants will be randomly assigned to one of four study conditions: control, use of GM only (with control), use of ELS only (with control), and use of both modules. The effectiveness of these interventions will be evaluated by measuring: i) changes in students\u2019 mindset beliefs, ii) changes in using effective learning strategies, iii) comparing exam performance between the study conditions in the courses, and iv) differential impact for underrepresented minority students (URM) in the introductory and general chemistry courses across the two institutions. The long-term impact of the project will be examined by comparing completion rates in subsequent chemistry courses. Additionally, focus group interviews will be conducted to explore and explain the synergistic effects of the two modules. The project team will disseminate findings by creating a website with training and tutorial materials for potential adopters of the GM and ELS modules, training instructors in the host institutions, organizing workshops at regional and national conferences, and through conference presentations and publications in chemistry/science education journals. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
