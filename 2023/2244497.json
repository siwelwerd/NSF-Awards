 "awd_abstract_narration": "The establishment of a summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Texas Permian Basin allows for a unique opportunity for undergraduate students, especially minority and historically underrepresented, to conduct rigorous research in science and technology disciplines. This REU Site will expose students to undergraduate research and provide a first-hand, inquiry-based approach to learning. One-on-one mentorship in the research setting early in the students\u2019 college career significantly improves their understanding of the material covered in their courses and equips them with essential soft and marketable skills such as critical thinking, teamwork, communication, personal and social responsibility. Additionally, this project enhances the diversification of the community of STEM professionals by increasing student engagement from various ethnicities and socioeconomic backgrounds. Students will be trained on a wide range of scientific equipment and methods in order to tackle real problems related to energy management and security as well as environmental protection. Students will present their findings at regional, national, and international conferences in their field.\r\n\r\nThe Permian Basin, the top producing petroleum province in the country, is also home to ever-increasing large areas of solar and wind farms. It is a highly dynamic energy hub that provides students and faculty with unique multidisciplinary research opportunities that align with economic growth and technological advances in the West Texas area. Energy production, however, is often associated with a negative impact on the environment. From induced seismicity and groundwater contamination due to hydraulic fracturing and enhanced oil recovery techniques to pollution and reduced air quality as a result of drilling operations and flaring of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, among many others. Participating students will study these problems in state-of-the-art laboratories under guidance from highly qualified scientists. Results from their projects will enhance our understanding of the problems\u2019 causes, provide viable solutions, and guide future research.\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
