 "awd_abstract_narration": "California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB) campus will host an Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site focused on ocean and coastal sciences.  CSUMB, a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) with a strong undergraduate research program, will serve as the hub of the Monterey Bay Regional REU program. In addition to research opportunities at CSUMB, they will place students at five partner institutions: \r\nNaval Postgraduate School, \r\nElkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, \r\nHopkins Marine Station of Stanford University, \r\nMonterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, and \r\nMoss Landing Marine Laboratory. \r\n\r\nThe program leverages the scientific and educational assets of the Monterey Bay Region to increase the diversity and number of students prepared for careers in Ocean Science. The program will: 1) recruit participants with an emphasis on students from underrepresented groups and those from research limited institutions; 2) prepare students in advance of the 10-week REU for the rigors of undertaking original research; 3) engage students in innovative research in Oceanography, Marine Biology and Ecology, Ocean Engineering, and Marine Geology; 4) provide rigorous research and professional development support for students during and after the REU to maintain interest and involvement in the Ocean Sciences; and 5) provide students with high caliber faculty mentoring across all phases of the REU. Interns will have a wide variety of options for research experiences. Oceanography topics include, Trace Metal Analysis, Biological Oceanography, Internal Wave Dynamics, Ocean Analysis and Prediction, Ocean Modeling, Nearshore Processes, and Coastal Circulation. Marine biology and ecology topics include Marine Landscape Ecology, Marine Microbiology, Fish Ecology, Marine Physiology, Population Genetics, Invasion Ecology, Conservation Biology, Thermal Stress Physiology, and Biomechanics. Marine Geology topics include Coastal Erosion, Sediment Transport, Seafloor Mapping, Biogeochemical Analysis, Sedimentology of Upwelling, Biogenic Sediments, and Geomorphology of Coastal Environments. Ocean Engineering topics include Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Ocean Instrumentation, Computer Programming, and Artificial Intelligence.\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
