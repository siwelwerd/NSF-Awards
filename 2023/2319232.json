 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funding to support a number of US-based students for attending the 59th version of the annual IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) with the intention of exposing them to the discipline and to encourage them to pursue careers in emerging issues in the area of Circuits and Systems research. Participation in this symposium is considered an important part of the graduate-school experience of students in computer engineering, providing the opportunity to interact with senior researchers and to be exposed to leading-edge work in the field. The support will enable dissemination of scientific knowledge to students who would otherwise not have the experience. This student-travel support will also facilitate the development of promising graduate students and will indirectly help train the workforce of the future in the key areas of computer engineering, in general, and Semiconductor Microelectronics in particular. Participation of women and members of underrepresented populations will be given due consideration for receiving support through this grant.\r\n\r\nThe International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) for more than 50 years has been the premier conference where emerging trends and novel concepts of Circuits and Systems research have been explored. The 2023 edition of this conference will address key trends and challenges in these areas and includes Keynote and Plenary Talks, Technical Paper Sessions, Tutorials, Panels, and Special Sessions. The conference committee has set up adequate evaluation criteria to select qualified students from a pool of applicants formed via open advertisement. While the requested funds will primarily be used for supporting graduate students, the committee may also consider US-based undergraduate applicants and post-docs in order to better reach a diverse population of potential researchers in this field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
