 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB) is a leading global forum for biometric research, focusing on automated identification methods using physiological or behavioral characteristics such as fingerprints, facial features, iris patterns, voice, and gait. IJCB showcases novel research contributions covering various aspects of biometrics, including sensor design, feature extraction and matching algorithms, security and privacy, the social impact of biometric technology, multi-modal and multi-spectral biometrics, mobile-based biometrics, template protection and cryptosystems, biometric DeepFakes, and more. By providing a comprehensive platform for researchers and practitioners, IJCB facilitates the exchange of knowledge and fosters advancements in the field of biometrics. The field's significance extends to areas such as digital data forensics and law enforcement, contributing to the foundation of US competitiveness. One of the key advantages of the conference is the close interaction between senior researchers and students. IJCB offers various avenues for student growth, including poster sessions, competitions, and the Doctoral Consortium. These activities provide students with opportunities to present their work, engage in discussions with experienced professionals, and gain valuable insights into the field. To ensure that students with financial need can fully participate in the IJCB conference, particularly in activities like the Doctoral Consortium, this funding supports student travel expenses.\r\n\r\nThe consortium is purposefully designed to enable research exposure and training opportunities for the next generation of scientists. The IJCB 2023 Doctoral Consortium, held as a parallel event to special sessions on the first day of the conference, includes brief oral research presentations by participating students and a mentoring session with senior researchers. Thus, participating students establish professional relationships with experienced researchers, gain valuable insights from senior members of the research community, receive constructive feedback, and expand their professional network. Preference is given to students from underrepresented groups, including women, minorities, and people with disabilities, as well as students attending the conference for the first time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
