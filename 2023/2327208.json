 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum computation has been a major area of research for several decades now, with researchers from many scientific fields across academia, industry and government working together towards the development of quantum technologies. If a powerful quantum computer can be built it will fundamentally transform the landscape of information science and technology. While errors due to the delicate nature of typical quantum states have mitigated progress, topological quantum computation (TQC) is an approach that could overcome this issue. This is by utilizing materials in which information can be \"knotted,\" like a quantum quipu, making them naturally robust against the most common errors. After several years of the relevant research groups working separately, the time is right to bring together a diverse group of physicists and mathematicians with the goal of re-examining the field and exploring new platforms for topological quantum computation. This grant supports the participation of US-based researchers in a workshop to be held in the UK to achieve this goal, foster new collaborations between researchers in the US, the UK, and the rest of the world, and broaden the participation of junior researchers and members of groups historically under-represented in this area. This workshop will bring together researchers in a diversity of fields in and around TQC for the purpose of broadening and deepening the subject, with an eye towards accelerating the realization of scalable technology.\r\n\r\nThe hurdle of scalable fault-tolerance is insurmountable with the current incremental progress -- while it is possible to engineer systems supporting hundreds of physical qubits, applications beyond mere proof of principle require millions of qubits to implement robust error correction. Topological quantum computation relies upon the preparation of topological phases of matter supporting non-abelian anyons to perform inherently fault-tolerant operations. As errors are corrected at the hardware level through the topological nature of anyons, the problem of scalability is simultaneously overcome. On the other hand, despite years of effort we still do not have unassailable confirmation that non-abelian anyons exist. We will explore new directions beyond the traditional anyon community,  embracing relevant topics such as quantum cellular automata, fractons, categorical symmetries and motion groups in 3-dimensions. A website for this event is available at: https://www.icms.org.uk/TopologicalQuantumComputation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nBuilding a quantum computer that outperforms the best digital computers is a daunting task of national security significance.Its success depends on how well we can control and mitigate errors.The mathematical field of topology, which focuses on global properties of spaces, offers both an approach to fault-tolerance through hardware-level indifference to perturbations, and systematic sources of quantum error correcting codes. This meeting brought together the world experts in topological approaches to quantum computation to present the latest ideas and consider the next steps. The 42 participants included scientists of diverse backgrounds and career stages from Europe, North America, South America and Asia.\n\n\nThe common theme was understanding how topological physics and topological methods can be brought to bear on the problem of building a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The perspectives ranged from all areas of mathematics (analysis, algebra, topology) to condensed matter physics and theoretical computer science. As can be seen from the conference websitehttps://www.icms.org.uk/TopologicalQuantumComputation the 16 talks were scientifically diverse, but universally cutting-edge including a report on the recent breakthroughs in simulating anyons, a proposal for specific experiments to probe the features of topological phases of matter, a new dynamical approach to topological (error correcting) codes, an investigation of the mathematics of 3-dimensional topological physics through motions of loops, a physical interpretation of a mathematical process called \"zesting\" and a retrospective on the past approaches and suggestions for a way forward.\n\n\nRecognizing that such an ambitious project is only feasible with a diverse group of participants, the list of invited speakers was carefully designed to emphasize the contributions of the whole community. To wit, 6 of the 16 speakers were women and the ages of the speakers ranged from several in their 20s to one in their 80s. It was anticipated that this conference will spawn many more like it, and this is already being borne out.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/25/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: EricCRowell\n"
