 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thien T. Khuu is awarded an NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (NSF MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and activities related to broaden participation by groups underrepresented in STEM. This fellowship to Dr. Khuu supports the research project entitled \u201cMPS-Ascend: Quantifying Accelerated Reaction Kinetics in Microdroplets with pH-Jump and Mass Spectrometry: From Small Molecules to Proteins and Beyond\u201d under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Southern California, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Jahan M. Dawlaty. \r\n\r\nThis proposal intends to study accelerated chemical reactions in microdroplets where the reactions are observed to occur significantly faster than in the solution phase. The proposal will use photoacids and green fluorescent protein as model systems to measure the rate of proton transfer reactions in microdroplets using ultrafast fluorescence spectroscopy and complementary mass spectrometry techniques. If successful, the proposed research could answer fundamental questions on the accelerated reaction kinetics of biological systems in microdroplets and could develop new technologies for future academic research as well as for industrial applications. \r\n\r\nThe PI intends to be actively involved with the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics & Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) to broaden participation of local Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans students in the Los Angeles area in science education and research. The proposed activities include monthly science demos at local middle and high schools, mentoring and tutoring of students, organizing science workshops for extracurricular programs, and fundraising for expanding the SACNAS@USC Community College Research Fellowship Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
