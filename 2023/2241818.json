 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the increase in connected devices comes an increase in network traffic.  Applications that we use every day, such as video conferencing, each need to have traffic processed to secure and optimize the application.  Current network infrastructure is showing signs that in the near future it won't be able to keep up with the growing demand or increased needs, such as having higher definition video calls with more participants and imperceptible delays in the communication.  While some solutions have been proposed to help solve this problem, they do so at the cost of compatibility, which would require rewriting a large body of software that has been developed and tested over the course of over a decade.  This proposal introduces a new way of thinking about the way network traffic is handled that will enable both forward and backwards compatibility with modern software while meeting the needs of applications.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this proposal introduces Transparent Network Acceleration (TNA), which is a novel architecture that decomposes Linux network functionality into fast-path and slow-path functions with explicitly optimized execution environments for each. TNA dynamically and automatically builds a minimal fast path that is instantiated and adjusted at run-time, leading to a transparently accelerated networking stack that fully retains the Linux networking interfaces. Two core mechanisms are introduced.  First, to create a highly efficient fast path, TNA automatically and dynamically instantiates only the part of the network stack that is used.  New techniques are introduced to introspect the Linux kernel, build a dependency graph of functions, and assemble and deploy an optimal fast path. Second, it targets two fast-path execution environments from a single source code description of modules: (i) the eXpress Data Path (XDP), for in-kernel processing, and (ii) a field programmable gate array (FPGA) based SmartNIC, for hardware accelerated processing. As part of these targets, the design of modules, the compilation to hardware or software, and synchronizing the state represent a novel and complete design flow. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of these two core mechanisms, we complete the project with a case study of automatically accelerating a selective forwarding unit (SFU) video conferencing network function deployed with considerations such as firewalling and container networking.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
