 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Safe Agricultural Products and Water Graph (SAWGraph) project aims to build and test a knowledge graph as a novel tool for (1) monitoring and tracing Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in our environment, food and water supplies, and for (2) assessing how different communities are exposed to different levels of PFAS-related health risks. PFAS, commonly referred to as \"forever chemicals\" due to their resistance to degradation, pose significant health risks and have become pervasive in our environment, water supplies, and food chain. Progress on addressing PFAS contamination is hampered by the fragmented nature of relevant data and knowledge. SAWGraph will bring together diverse datasets that span: (1) sites of concerns with known or suspected PFAS contamination, (2) samples of PFAS levels in water, soil, plant and animal tissue, feed, and agricultural food products, and (3) sites and communities that may be at highest risk of exposure. This will be integrated with knowledge from EPA\u2019s CompTox Chemical Dashboard on chemical composition, known toxicity, regulatory status, and properties relevant to transport and fate analysis. To evaluate and facilitate dialogue about SAWGraph, it will be equipped with prototype user interfaces that support query and faceted search, along with offering interactive geo-visualizations and spatial analysis functions.\r\n\r\nSAWGraph will incorporate data considering social aspects, including PFAS exposure risks in disadvantaged communities, and seek expert input to balance health and economic implications of PFAS contamination, particularly regarding the potential impact on agriculture. In response to the evolving PFAS monitoring and safety regulations, SAWGraph will align its efforts with governmental stakeholders to ensure it remains supportive of the decision-making processes concerning PFAS regulations. To ensure success of the work, the team will partner with federal agency and state-level stakeholders who are key producers, maintainers, and users of PFAS data. Partnerships with stakeholders will enhance the efficacy of tools like SAWGraph in informing PFAS-related decisions, with the aid of stakeholder expertise for data access, processing, and interpretation. Through continuous interaction and collaboration with these partners and additional stakeholders, the project seeks to secure widespread buy-in and support, ensuring the graph's long-term success and sustainability beyond the project's duration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
