 "awd_abstract_narration": "The USENIX Security Conference is one of the most important research conferences for professionals to present cutting edge research of fundamental importance to advancing understanding of computer systems security. Published research has specific application to security threats and vulnerabilities in computing systems; the design, implementation and implications of systems software; virtualization, system and network management and troubleshooting; cloud and edge computing; security, privacy, and trust; mobile and wireless systems; and more. This award provides funding for approximately 25 students to attend the 18th USENIX Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS \u201823) and the 32nd USENIX Security Symposium (Security \u201823).\r\n\r\nUSENIX conferences gather researchers from across the academic, government, and industry communities to foster cross-disciplinary approaches and to address shared research challenges. This cross-disciplinary emphasis makes them well-suited as a target for student participation, and the important topics addressed in these conferences encourage student research and collaboration in critical areas of advanced computing. This award enables the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the conferences. It also extends the impact of research presented to a broader audience inclusive of junior researchers from across the country. For 2023, USENIX events are planned to be in-person events, with virtual participation if pandemic conditions require.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
