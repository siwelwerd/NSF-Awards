The significance and importance of the summer school include: instruction on how to build and reason about reliability and correctness of computing systems; building international community and cooperation in foundational research areas; and enhancing education of US students, including students from underrepresented groups, by exposure to and interaction with leading-edge research and researchers. By supporting US-based students, the school will thus train the next generation of researchers and practitioners in both industry and academia. This year's edition of the summer school has an all-woman roster of lecturers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
