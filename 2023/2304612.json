 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project regards the ability to achieve early detection of cancers of the esophagus and throat.  This project targets a multimillion-dollar annual market and has the potential to positively impact rural and underserved communities without access to specialty endoscopy clinics.  The project also has the potential to positively impact the African American community, where the incidence of esophageal cancer is higher.  \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to assist clinicians in detecting tumors of the esophagus and throat at an earlier stage, which will have life-saving effects.  This project will combine liquid lens technology with artificial intelligence software and astronomical imaging techniques, with the objective of generating three-dimensional images of early stage esophageal and throat tumors.  This particular study will focus on acquiring quality three-dimensional images of a cadaver\u2019s esophagus and pharynx to prepare for the next stage of testing and development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
