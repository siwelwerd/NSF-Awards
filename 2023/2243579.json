 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project supports travel to the 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Cloud Summit at George Mason University Campus, Fairfax, Virginia, October 21-22, 2022. The IEEE Cloud Summit provides a unique international forum for researchers, developers, and practitioners to present cutting-edge research and best practices and to exchange ideas and views on the current trends and technical challenges related to Cloud Computing, Fog Computing, Internet of Things, and Edge Computing as well as their applications for societal benefit. The unique aspect of the IEEE Cloud Summit is that it will provide participants with a venue to share ideas and learn from academic and industry leaders. The conference's unique aspects, industrial tutorials, and hands-on experience will significantly benefit the participants.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge shared and advanced at these conferences has practical and meaningful application to many tools used in research, as well as to the ethical, cultural, and social ramifications of cloud computing technology. This grant allows the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference and extends the impact of research presented to a broad audience of young researchers from across the country. IEEE is an open access organization, and all research and results presented and published at these events are freely available to the public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
