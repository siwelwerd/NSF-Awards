 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide support for the Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics (TexAMP) Symposium 2024 that takes place at Texas A&M University on February 9-11, 2024. The TexAMP Symposia form an annual conference series initiated in 2013 and held at various universities in Texas. Leading researchers in their fields are invited to give presentations. These lectures are augmented by contributed talks, where researchers from the region (Texas and neighboring states) present their latest work. As such they provide a forum for getting acquainted with state-of-the-art results in Mathematical Physics and related areas of Analysis, and promote communication and collaboration among researchers in the region. Importantly, these meetings allow graduate students and junior faculty to learn about cutting edge research and to receive feedback on their own work from an impressive group of first-class experts in the field. Several generations of young researchers have polished their presentation skills and established professional links at TexAMP events. Funds are to support young participants (graduate students and postdocs) from universities in the region, as well as contribute to the travel and accommodation costs of some of the invited speakers. More information about the TexAMP Symposium 2024 can be found at the following website: texamp.github.io\r\n\r\nThe seven invited lectures at the TexAMP Symposium 2024 will cover a broad variety of research areas in Analysis and Mathematical Physics such as stability of solitary nonlinear waves, qualitative analysis of Laplace eigenfunctions, complex analytic tools in spectral theory, probabilistic dynamics of nonlinear dispersive equations, geometric spectral theory, topological phases of matter, and microlocal analysis. The symposium is structured to create many opportunities for discussions, fostering an environment of collaboration and collegiality. All speakers are asked to make their presentations accessible to junior participants. Two sessions of contributed talks, where all participants can present their research, are planned in the prime-time slots of the event. Poster sessions are held during two extended refreshment breaks, to ensure maximum attendance as well as sharpened attention from senior experts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
