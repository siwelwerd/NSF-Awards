 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nScience and technology thrive on the discovery of new materials with unique optoelectronic properties. Nanosized materials commonly referred to as nanoparticles are in the forefront of modern scientific research because of their ever-expanding applications, specifically in energy storage and conversion for a sustainable future. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, Prof. Rajesh Sardar and his group at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis will expand the scientific understanding of metal oxide nanoparticle synthesis via colloidal synthetic methods. Because these nanoparticles contain oxygen coupled in a unique manner with non-toxic metals, the research allows for highly tunable and environmentally friendly nanoparticle compositions. The unique combination of shape anisotropy and surface chemistry of these nanoparticles will be optimized to enhance their optoelectronic properties directed towards highly advanced electronic devices and catalysts. The project aims to train underrepresented minority students through mentored research, and integration of research results into the university level graduate and undergraduate courses. The scientific and communication skills of students at every level will be enhanced through multi-faceted collaboration between scientists from universities and national laboratories, as well as mentoring and workshops. \r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe discovery of new functional materials with unique optical and electronic properties will allow rational design of optoelectronic devices with better performance. This project supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the NSF\u2019s Division of Materials Research aims to synthesize localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-active metal oxide nanoparticles where LSPR properties are generated from oxygen vacancies (anion deficiencies) in the stoichiometric inorganic lattice that leads to free (conduction band) electron density as high as in plasmonic noble metal (Au and Ag) nanoparticles. These anion deficient metal oxide nanoparticles are expected to produce strong electromagnetic field enhancement and hot electrons that are most desirable for various light-driven applications. This project seeks to understand the structure-property relationships of ligand-passivated nanoparticles. Specifically, the project (1) synthesizes LSPR-active, targeted anisotropic shaped nanoparticles via seed-mediated growth approaches, (2) performs spectroscopic and microscopic analyses, along with theoretical calculations to understand the mechanisms that control the shape and desired composition of such nanoparticles, and (3) utilizes organic passivating ligands to control and achieve substantially enhanced optoelectronic properties with unique abilities. As a part of the broader impact activities, graduate and undergraduate, along with underrepresented high school students will develop research skills through mentorship and workshops. Additionally, research outcomes will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses, as well as disseminated at national and international meeting, and peer-reviewed publications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
