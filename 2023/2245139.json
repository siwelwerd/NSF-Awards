 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education organized by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) is one of the oldest ACM conferences and is SIGCSE\u2019s flagship conference. The Symposium is held annually, in North America, and is the premier venue for computing education researchers to meet and disseminate their work. The NSF showcase at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium provides an opportunity for NSF grant recipients to showcase and disseminate the results of their work. The NSF showcase provides grant recipients the opportunity to circulate their ideas, obtain feedback, recruit collaborators and adopters, and consult with program officers much earlier in the project cycle, providing crucial insights that improve the likelihood of the projects succeeding and the findings being disseminated. The NSF showcase will also include opportunities for members of the computing education community to connect with NSF program officers to explore grant programs and to receive feedback on proposal ideas. \r\n\r\nThe NSF showcase will facilitate a discussion among the affinity groups who collectively participate in computing education research, specifically targeting issues related to preparing students who are computationally fluent, and building and enhancing the computing professional workforce, which includes research software engineers, research data science professionals, advanced cyberinfrastructure systems professionals, and others. The NSF showcase provides a way for many computing educators to see NSF projects in progress, to interact with NSF program officers, to learn about NSF programs, and discuss potential projects for funding. The SIGCSE Technical Symposium is regularly attended, with pre-pandemic attendance at 1,900 attendees. The conference primarily serves a US audience with around 90% of the attendees being from the US with an additional 5% from Canada and other attendees from Europe, Asia, and Australasia primarily. The NSF Showcase is funded by the NSF IUSE: EHR Program, which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
