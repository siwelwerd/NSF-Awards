 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photodissociation regions (PDRs) --- interstellar gas whose properties are determined by far-ultraviolet radiation --- govern the formation of cold, dense, molecular gas where star formation can occur.  This research project will use high quality observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to resolve and characterize the different layers of gas within PDRs in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).  The processes within PDRs are sensitive to the abundance of heavy elements, and the SMC is poor in heavy elements relative to the Milky Way, so the results from this project will help shed light on how physical conditions within PDRs depend on the \u201cmetallicity\u201d of the gas.  The project will train a graduate student in methods of advanced astronomical research, and it will develop a program to facilitate the participation of incoming community college transfer students in undergraduate research. \r\n\r\nThe investigators have obtained new ALMA observations that resolve the structure of a PDR in the low metallicity environment of the SMC. They will undertake three efforts to characterize the observed PDR.  First, they will measure the temperature of the gas using the rotational emission lines of carbon monoxide (CO) and the fine structure lines of neutral carbon (C), comparing the measurements to PDR models. Next, they will compare the location of the atomic-to-molecular hydrogen (H/H2) transition to the C+/C/CO transition to study the nature of \u201cCO-dark H2 gas\u201d --- PDR layers where hydrogen is molecular (H2) while carbon is either ionized (C+) or neutral.  Finally, they will use the high velocity resolution possible with ALMA to study the dynamics and turbulence of gas in the PDR.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
