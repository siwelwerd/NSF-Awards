Held every three years, this conference is the international scientific community\u2019s premier comprehensive meeting on fog and dew. The Fort Collins meeting, the first time the conference has been held in the United States, will bring together experts from around the globe to exchange information and stimulate new research concerning how, when, and where fogs form, how they impact the safety of our highways and airports, how fogs and dew provide important input of water to water-limited ecosystems, how fogs and dew impact air pollution, and how fogs and dew can be harvested to provide a source of fresh water in arid regions.\r\n\r\nThis project will support participation of graduate students and early career scientists in a dynamic conference forum for the exchange of ideas and the latest research findings from scientists interested in fog and dew chemistry, fog microphysics, fog deposition to vegetation, dew formation on natural and artificial surfaces, fog impacts on transportation and other infrastructure, the collection of fog and dew for freshwater production, satellite remote sensing of fogs and low clouds, numerical simulation of fog formation, studies of ice fog, riming, and frost, impacts of a changing climate on fog and low cloud occurrence, and more. Its interdisciplinary nature lends this conference a unique character at the crossroads of meteorology, ecology, atmospheric chemistry, cloud physics, water resources, climate, and resiliency of built infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
