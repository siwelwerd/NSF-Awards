Support will include sponsoring student trainees to attend and actively participate in the symposium. The trainees will help organize a career panel with scientists from diverse careers, with the goal of sharing information on various career paths and professional development strategies that promote retention in STEM-related fields.\r\n\r\nThe MGO subgroup brings together computational and experimental researchers with a focus on biophysical characterization of mechanisms underlying chromatin biology. The symposium will advance research and training in chromatin biology and catalyze cross-disciplinary collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
