 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is on developing a biomedical device capable of detecting and monitoring patient's ability to combat infections. The proposed technology addresses the unmet need in emergency department settings of the hospitals where it can be used to monitor patients\u2019 response to therapeutic treatments and identify high-risk patients. A minimal viable prototype (MVP) will be developed from proof-of-concept biosensing technology (called Immuno-Dx), which is centered around monitoring natural ability of blood cells to kill pathogens. Immuno-Dx can have applications in areas (i) to better understand immune system responses of patients to pathogenic infections, (ii) to develop new immunotherapy drugs by pharmaceutical companies, and (iii) to strategize patient treatments by physicians. Biosensing device will be able to provide information regarding patients\u2019 ability to combat infection within 30 min from a drop of whole blood. This PFI-TT project will enable workforce development in spirit with the NSF mission of training next generation of scientists and engineers in technical and entrepreneurial skills, while creating a direct impact on national healthcare and aiding the US economy. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project\u2019 primary objective is to develop an MVP with integrated electronics, data processing, user interface, and onchip sample processing to perform the phagocytosis assay within 30 min from a drop of whole blood. Value proposition of proposed technology lies in its ability to provide vital information about patients\u2019 immune response to infections and therapeutics, to fulfil unmet need for personalized monitoring of patients in emergency department settings of the hospitals. The key innovative features include automated sensing of patient\u2019s ability to combat infections from a drop of whole blood within 30 min, integration of machine learning (ML) models for improved accuracy, automation of manual sample processing steps, and developing a user-inspired 3D printed reader with integrated electronics, data processing and touch controlled user interface. Current key attributes and value proposition of Immuno-Dx can also be leveraged in other areas e.g., infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, and cancer and can be used by researchers, pharmaceutical companies, clinicians, healthcare providers, and biotech companies. The potential outcome of PFI-TT proposal will be the transition of Immuno-Dx technology from investigator research laboratory to a commercial startup company.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
