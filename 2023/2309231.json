 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at maximizing the scientific output of NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) via formulating strategies for detector improvements and the development and implementation of new data analysis algorithms. This project will contribute to advancing precision measurement technology, deepen understanding of general relativity, and push the frontier of experimental physics at the interface between gravitational and quantum physics. It also supports the observation and interpretation of multi-messenger astrophysical sources. This project will serve as a training ground for early career physicists and astrophysicists, teaching them a wide variety of research techniques. By interacting with the broader quantum metrology community, this project will benefit other precision measurement experiments outside the gravitational-wave community. Participants of this project will also vigorously pursue a wide range of activities that reach out to the broader scientific community and the general public through (i) dissemination of research results and scientific data via publications, lectures, and the internet (including YouTube); (ii) interacting with K-12 educators and students, e.g., via the LIGO and Caltech Astronomy outreach programs; and (iii) public lecturing.\r\n\r\nThe primary scientific objective of this project is to drive the continued improvement of LIGO sensitivity, to enable the most efficient analysis of LIGO data, and to extract fundamental physics for upcoming LIGO detections. More general objectives are to contribute to the advancement of precision measurement technology, to contribute to our understanding of general relativity, and to push the frontier of experimental physics at the interface between gravitational and quantum physics. More specifically: (A) This project will formulate and evaluate innovative approaches to improving LIGO\u2019s sensitivity. For quantum noise, this program will: better understand the Fundamental Quantum Limit for waveform detection, design back-action evading quantum amplification techniques, and explore new readout strategies that potentially circumvent quantum noise. This project will also study strategies for lowering thermal noise. By collaborating with experimentalists, we attempt to make theoretical progress that will eventually impact real experiments. (B) This project  will apply numerical relativity simulations to LIGO data analysis: (i) Simulations following up on LIGO detections will be used to verify the accuracy of semi-analytic waveform models, to explore parameter biases of these models, and to perform alternative parameter estimation strategies as needed; and (ii) Improved surrogate waveform models, which interpolate between numerical relativity waveforms to produce a waveform at requested parameters to high accuracy, will be implemented into LALSuite and be used in parameter estimation studies on future events. This project will also better understand the content of binary black hole ringdown waves and apply a new filtering technique to analyze the mode contents of numerical relativity waveforms and LIGO data. (C) This project will use LIGO data to explore the vicinity of black hole horizons, including better describing the ways gravitational waves can be reflected from the vicinity of the horizon and the echoes they might cause, and formulate tests for stochastic metric perturbations caused by effects of quantum gravity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
