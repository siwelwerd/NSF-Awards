 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports conferences in the Atlanta Lecture Series in Graph Theory and Combinatorics, to be held at Georgia Institute of Technology and Georgia State University, with the first conference at Georgia State University on November 4-5, 2023. Combinatorics and graph theory have undergone significant developments in the past few decades. The proposed conferences will feature the latest research developments and trends in the areas of structural graph theory, extremal graph theory, and probabilistic combinatorics. \r\n \r\nEach conference features two one-hour lectures by a distinguished researcher, four one-hour lectures by established researchers mainly from the southeast region, and four 30-minute talks by early-career researchers and graduate students. The meetings will provide opportunities for interactions among researchers of all career stages including students, especially those from underrepresented groups, to engage with experts in a variety of fields in mathematics. Additional information concerning financial support and the conference schedule is maintained on the lecture series website: https://math.gsu.edu/gchen/als_XXVII.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
