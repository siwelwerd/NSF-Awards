 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award will partially support the 2023 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Seminar on \u201cWater Disinfection, Byproducts, and Health\u201d that will be held at Mount Holyoke College in July 29-Aug 4, 2023.  The GRC and seminar will discuss the latest advances in drinking water disinfection research. The conference will feature research leaders, policy experts, and practitioners while also providing a venue for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early-career scientists to network, learn, and collaborate. The GRC will include a special session dedicated to discussing issues pertaining to diversity, equity, and inclusion in environmental science and engineering. A seminar will precede the conference and will expand opportunities for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early-career scientists to present their work and to participate in career mentorship with senior scientists. NSF funding will enable the conference organizers to support increased participation of students and early-career scientists from underrepresented groups in STEM.\r\n\r\nWater disinfection is effective in preventing waterborne diseases; however, the disinfectants used can react with dissolved organic matter and halide ions to form potentially toxic disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Water disinfection processes can be impacted by a host of global issues, including water contamination, water scarcity, land use patterns, and climate change. Consequently, balancing microbial risks from pathogens and chemical risks from DBPs poses technical challenges that require interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. This Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Seminar will feature and discuss innovative research on chemical, microbiological, toxicological, and engineering aspects of water disinfection. The overarching goal is to advance the science and technology associated with the safe and effective disinfection of drinking water. The GRC will cover five areas of importance: (1) Microbial and chemical quality of drinking water and health implications, (2) detection of novel DBPs and their toxicity, (3) mechanisms of DBP formation, (4) exposure to DBPs and epidemiological consequences, and (5) development of novel drinking water strategies and regulatory guidelines. As with the conference, the seminar will feature lectures with dedicated time for in-depth discussions, and engaging poster sessions, as well as time for informal gatherings. Collectively taken together, the GRC and Seminar will be catalysts for scientists and engineers from different disciplines to gather, converse, and form collaborations to devise creative solutions to global water challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
