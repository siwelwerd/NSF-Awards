 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Joint Alabama-Florida Conference on Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems and Applications  (JAF DE-DS)\" organized by the departments of Mathematics and Statistics at Auburn University, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Florida International University, and Florida State University will take place in Auburn, AL, May 13-14, 2023. This conference will bring together a diverse group of researchers in the geographic area near the states of Alabama and Florida. The award funds will help defray travel and local expenses of the participants with no current federal support, graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral fellows, early career researchers, and scientists from under-represented groups in STEM. \r\n\r\nThematically, the conference will be centered around a broad set of topics in partial differential equations including dynamics of nonlinear waves in dispersive and dissipative systems, long-term behavior of evolution equations, reaction-diffusion equations, pattern formation, and applied spectral theory. The main research directions are reaction-diffusion equations (population dynamics, chemotaxis, and combustion models), models of fluid and gas dynamics, novel mechanisms in stability analysis of nonlinear waves (Maslov index). More information can be found on the conference website: \r\nhttps://www.auburn.edu/cosam/al_fl_differential_conference/index.htm\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
