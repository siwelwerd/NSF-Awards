 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge of basal temperatures and geothermal fluxes underneath the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is key to modeling ice-sheet flow, to finding locations where climate records are preserved, and in general to better understand subglacial conditions that influence ice-sheet evolution. Yet such information has been difficult to acquire and there exist limited basal temperature and geothermal flux measurements from a few, isolated locations. This project will develop and test a new measurement capability that would couple unreinforced single-mode optical fiber with melt probe technology.  The project aims to develop and test a capability that would greatly expand the number and distribution of temperature and flux observations from ice sheets.  An immediate goal is to enhance the measurement capabilities of probes to be used by the Center for Oldest Ice Exploration (COLDEX) Science and Technology Center.\r\n\r\nThe team will augment the capability of melt probes that are presently being built for COLDEX to deploy optical dust-loggers to depths up to 3000 m in Greenland and East Antarctica. The team will add to each probe 3000 m of single-mode optical fiber to unspool as the probe descends. Distributed Temperature Sensing at the deployment site will be realized with minimal additional surface equipment and a single additional field team member.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nTo understand how ice flows down into the oceans from the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets, it is essential to have information on the temperature of ice from the top to the bottom of the ice sheet because warmer ice flows more easily than colder ice. It is also essential to know how warm the ice is near its base to know whether liquid water lubricates ice flow. The problem is that it is very difficult, and therefore expensive, to place instruments within and beneath the great ice sheets to measure temperature. The purpose of this project has been initial development of a new means to measure temperature from top to bottom of an ice sheet at much lower cost than was previously possible, so that temperature information can be acquired in many more places across the vast expanse of the ice sheets. We have for the first time demonstrated a combination of two technologies to realize this goal. The first technology is an ice melt probe, which melts its way down into the ice using electrical power supplied from the surface, and which can penetrate miles of very cold ice (for example in East Antarctica) with much less equipment and much less fuel than would be needed for conventional ice drilling. The second technology is distributed temperature sensing using laser pulses on optical fiber to turn the fiber, effectively, into a long string of thermometers distributed along its length. We unspool optical fiber from the melt probe as it descends and let it freeze in as water above the probe refreezes into ice. Then we use laser equipment at the ice surface to send pulses down the fiber and we observe light that scatters back from within the fiber to infer changing temperatures along the length of the fiber. In this project, we demonstrated for the first time (1) that optical fiber could be deployed from a descending melt probe and frozen back into the ice without damaging the fiber; and (2) that following deployment we could indeed measure ice temperatures along the fiber. We did this in field work at the summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet in June 2024. The outcome of this project is knowledge of how to make measurements like this at many more ice sheet locations in Greenland and Antarctica so that understanding how ice flows into the sea and raises levels can be advanced.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/28/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DalePWinebrenner\n"
