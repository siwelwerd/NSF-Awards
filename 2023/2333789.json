 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Prototype-Open Knowledge Network project on Knowledge Graph to Support Evaluation and Development of Climate Models, aims to create a large multimodal knowledge graph of the most salient aspects of climate modeling, including data, climate models, and tasks. The climate models covered include both classical fluid dynamics models as well as AI-based models. The knowledge graph that is developed will take a holistic view of climate modeling while addressing one of the three key problems identified in the Report of the Office of Science Roundtable on Data for AI, viz., addressing \u201copen questions in AI with frameworks for relating data, models, and tasks.\u201d The climate model knowledge graph will ensure that existing models and datasets are leveraged in new climate modeling undertakings, thereby ensuring that past research investments are reused and fully leveraged in future work. The automated methods developed in this project will help infer paper-data-model-tasks relations, providing the ability to suggest useful, related artifacts to new undertakings thus shortening the time for relevant artifact searches. Successful creation of paper-model-tool relations and embedding of those into a knowledge graph will help provide a structured representation of climate models, making them more easily accessible. \r\n\r\nThe project contributes significantly to the field of information retrieval, with a particular focus on named entity recognition and the creation of a comprehensive knowledge graph. Research papers provide the necessary context for reusing research artifacts, by linking together data, models, and analyses, describing the role of a dataset (e.g., training or testing) and indicating whether a model is original or used as a baseline. Incorporating these insights into a knowledge graph provides researchers an intuitive and structured means for navigating the complex relationships among datasets, models, tools, and methods. This not only facilitates the discovery and reuse of existing research artifacts but also fosters collaboration and innovation in the field research, in this case climate research. Novel deep learning techniques will be developed for automatic entity and relation extraction, entity linking, and construction of a knowledge graph interconnecting these aspects. Novel technology will be developed for automatically identifying and cataloging public climate data and related highly reusable tools. The proposed approach is multimodal, dealing with images as well as tables from text-based publications. This project also has a focus on teaching and training of students at various levels, from high school to doctoral programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
