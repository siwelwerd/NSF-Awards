 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF Engines Development Award is focused on developing an inclusive innovation ecosystem and economic development engine for logistics in the Texoma region, spanning Texas and Oklahoma.  The envisioned future engine has the potential to transform innovation deserts in the region into strong economic contributors and generators of high-quality employment opportunities.  The region of service includes 26 counties in North Texas and Southeastern Oklahoma.  Logistics represents the second largest business sector, with over 889 million tons valued at $1.1 trillion moving through the region and employing over 450,000 workers.  Like the national economy, the region is experiencing a significant shortfall in skilled labor.   In June 2022, over 500,000 logistics job openings existed nationally, with the driver shortfall alone at over 80,000.  These shortages are particularly pronounced in the region as the second-largest industrial and fourth-largest freight market. A collaboration of universities, companies, government agencies, and workforce development organizations will lead the activity, including the University of North Texas, Southern Methodist University, University of Texas-Arlington, Dallas College, Southeastern Oklahoma State University, Texas Research Alliance, Dallas Regional Chamber, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Hillwood Properties, City of Dallas, Workforce Solutions, and the Southern Dallas County Inland Port Transportation Management Association.\r\n\t\r\nThe project will solicit use-inspired projects from the logistics community and address through research hubs located in disadvantaged areas to translate emerging technologies into innovative systems, practices, and workforce development programs. These hubs will conceptualize new products and services, incubate start-ups, and facilitate commercialization.  The envisioned future engine will incorporate three major technical thrusts:  autonomy, electrification, and cyber.  Autonomy integrates autonomous systems into logistics networks by generating innovations in surveillance/sending, computer vision, collision avoidance, object tracking, and smart city technologies. Cyber advances the technologies necessary for integrating logistics functions, data, and software across the supply chain, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, cybersecurity, optimization, and digital twins.  Electrification facilitates sustainable logistics by promoting innovations in renewable energy generation and microgrids, energy storage, battery technologies, hydrogen fuels, on-the-move EV wireless charging, energy harvesting, and grid resilience.  Workforce development overlays each thrust, and the project will closely collaborate with regional workforce development organizations to plan and develop new education vehicles and integrate these innovations and industry input into workforce training programs.  The Development Award will enable the creation of the Engine by promoting collaboration across universities, government and non-government entities, and logistics companies throughout the region and providing the support essential for creating the research hubs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
