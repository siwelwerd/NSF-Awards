 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate change presents a significant challenge for parents worldwide as they navigate the task of preparing the next generation for a rapidly changing world. This interdisciplinary project aims to address this challenge by focusing on the needs of under-resourced Latino families, with a particular emphasis on Latino children who bear a disproportionate burden from climatic changes. By integrating insights from climate science, child development social sciences, climate change communication, and learning sciences, the project seeks to develop effective strategies that empower parents and promote positive parenting practices in the face of climate change. The project acknowledges the unique challenges faced by under-resourced Latino families who often lack access to the resources and information necessary to navigate the impacts of climate change. By centering their voices and concerns, the project aims to provide these families with the tools and knowledge needed to raise resilient children capable of coping, adapting, and contributing to sustainable solutions. Through the integration of knowledge from multiple disciplines and collaboration with trusted community-based organizations, the project aims to develop a Science-Based Roadmap for Parenting During Climate Change. This roadmap not only supports parents in addressing the specific challenges posed by climate change but also contributes to ongoing research in climate science, child development, and communication. The project has the potential to inform and advance related lines of inquiry and foster the integration of equity-centered approaches in future research and practice. Furthermore, the project recognizes the broader impact of its work on other fields and society as a whole. By developing effective communication strategies and engaging with communities in culturally responsive ways, the project seeks to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and under-resourced communities. It strives to broaden access to new knowledge among low-income Latino families with lower educational attainment, ensuring that they have access to science-based parenting recommendations through trusted media channels and community organizations. The project also aims to enhance the capacity of parents as learners and STEM communicators, empowering them to play an active role in addressing the climate crisis and fostering a more inclusive and sustainable future.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of the project is to advance access to and engagement with science-based parenting strategies for Latino parents during the climate crisis. The project aims to address several key research questions: (1) What is the current knowledge level of parents regarding climate change (CC), their existing parenting strategies related to CC, and the knowledge and skills they wish to acquire? (2) Which key messages effectively address parents' concerns and needs, leading to learning and adoption of science-based parenting behaviors? (3) What are the most effective communication approaches for parents to discuss climate change with their children? (4) What skills can children acquire to better cope and adapt to the impacts of climate change? (5) Which STEM career paths will be in higher demand as climate change advances, and how can parents expose their children to these opportunities? (6) How can scientists collaborate with communities in culturally responsive ways to foster parent learning and children's connections with life and ecological systems? To answer these questions, the project will employ a multidisciplinary approach, integrating expertise from child development, climate science, informal learning, communication, and Latino studies. The research methods will include participatory research, which involves actively involving parents in the research process, and the design and development of a Science-Based Roadmap for Parenting During Climate Change. The roadmap will provide evidence-based guidelines and recommendations for parents to support their children's ability to cope, adopt sustainable lifestyles, contribute to climate change mitigation, and thrive. To evaluate the effectiveness of the project, a rigorous evaluation framework will be implemented, assessing the impact of the Science-Based Roadmap and the public engagement campaign launched in collaboration with Televisa Foundation and the Inner Space Center. The evaluation will measure changes in parents' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to climate change, as well as the extent to which children acquire the necessary skills to adapt to climate impacts. Dissemination efforts will focus on ensuring broad access to the Roadmap's parenting recommendations through trusted media outlets and community organizations, with a particular emphasis on reaching low-income families of color who have limited access to scientific research. The broader impacts of this project are multifaceted. Firstly, it aims to advance equity and belonging by raising the voices of Latino parents and addressing the unique needs and concerns of under-resourced communities. By actively involving community organizations, the project ensures that communication products and recommendations are culturally relevant and accessible. Secondly, the project seeks to promote public engagement with STEM among under-resourced audiences, improve the well-being of individuals and society, foster partnerships between academia, industry, and communities, and increase participation in STEM careers. By expanding the capacity of parents as learners and STEM communicators, the project empowers them to play an active role in addressing the climate crisis and promotes a more inclusive and sustainable future for all. This Research in Support of Wide-reaching Public Engagement with STEM project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which supports projects that: (a) contribute to research and practice that considers informal STEM learning's role in equity and belonging in STEM; (b) promote personal and educational success in STEM; (c) advance public engagement in scientific discovery; (d) foster interest in STEM careers; (e) create and enhance the theoretical and empirical foundations for effective informal STEM learning; (f) improve community vibrancy; and/or (g) enhance science communication and the public's engagement in and understanding of STEM and STEM processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
