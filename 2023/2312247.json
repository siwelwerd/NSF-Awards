 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metallic lithium (Li) is considered as one of the promising next-generation anode materials to replace conventional graphite in Li-ion batteries because of its high theoretical specific energy capacity and low reduction potential. However, dendrite growth on the electrode and unstable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation have created safety concerns in Li batteries and hindered practical applications. Introducing an artificial protective layer on the Li metal electrode is an effective strategy to stabilize the Li electrode, yet how this protective layer interacts with the electrochemical process of Li metal anode is not well understood. This project will integrate experiments and simulations to understand how the physical and chemical properties of the protective layer affect the electrochemical performance of the Li metal electrode. The fundamental knowledge gained will guide development of novel Li metal electrodes with high performance and improved safety for electric vehicles and other high-energy-density electrical storage devices. The project will also involve the education of graduate, undergraduate students, and K-12 students by course development, summer camp, and outreach activities in local museums. \r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to develop a new understanding of the key physical and chemical properties of the protective layer that leads to stable charge/discharge processes of the Li metal electrode. The state-of-the-art guideline is insufficient, and the model only considers the influences of the limited mechanical properties of the protective layer on the stabilization of the Li metal electrode. In this project, by an effective integration of experimental synthesis, characterization and phase-field simulations, a new understanding will be generated on electrochemistry and deformation/failure mechanism of suppressing dendrites, including mass transport, electric potential, stress, and deformation. The research goal will be reached by working on several objectives: (1) Effect of mechanical properties of the protective layer on the suppression of Li dendrite growth; (2) Effect of ionic mass transfer behaviors of the protective layer on the stabilization of the Li metal electrode; (3) Novel protective layer on Li metal for the high-performance assembled cells. The elucidated correlation between physical and chemical properties of the protective layer, and the electrochemical processes of the electrode is expected to open pathways for the novel design and fabrication of Li metal electrodes, leading to stable and high-performance next-generation energy storage devices.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the CBET Electrochemical Systems program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
