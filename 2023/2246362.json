 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for US researchers to attend a conference entitled \"Complex Analysis and Geometry\" in Budapest, Hungary. The conference will take place in June 23-30,2023, and will be hosted by the Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics. The topics of the conference emphasize the rich interactions between complex analysis and complex geometry. The conference will bring together well-known experts and junior researchers with the aim of communicating recent progress in the field and fostering research interaction and collaboration. Funds from the NSF will be used to support US participation in the conference.  Applications from early career mathematicians and underrepresented groups will be particularly encouraged. \r\n\r\nKey topics in this conference will include potential theoretic methods for the PDE's of complex geometry, potential theoretic methods in complex algebraic geometry and the Bergman kernel, complex dynamics in several variables, Oka manifolds and more. A conference focusing on these topics is timely considering the many recent exciting developments in these areas. The conference website is https://conferences.renyi.hu/lempert70/home\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
