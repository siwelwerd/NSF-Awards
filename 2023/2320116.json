 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. The University of Cincinnati is acquiring an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with a multitechnique-ready XPS surface analysis platform to support the research of Professors Yujie Sun, Anastasios Angelopoulos, Ryan J. White, Jingjie Wu, and Sarah J. Watzman. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of chemistry, materials science, impacting studies of sustainable energy and catalysis, sensing and sensor development, and nanomaterials. The instrument serves users from the Departments of Chemistry, Chemical & Environmental Engineering, Mechanical & Materials Engineering, and Electrical Engineering at the University of Cincinnati and surrounding region. XPS spectra are produced by irradiating a sample with X-rays that have sufficient energy to eject electrons. Next, the kinetic energy of the electrons is measured and subsequently related to their binding energy. These data can be related to the chemical elements in the sample and effects from their bonding environment. This instrument enhances teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students. The instrument provides more equitable access to an XPS instrument in the Greater Cincinnati area and surrounding region.   \r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. Research enabled by the instrument is focused on the following three areas: (1) Sustainable energy and catalysis. The objective of this focal area is to develop materials and catalysts for sustainable and renewable energy capture, storage, and utilization; (2) Sensing and sensor development. The objective of this focal area is to understand the sensor interface at both the materials and chemical level to develop sensors with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity for sensing and imaging applications; and (3) New nanomaterials. The objective of this focal area is to develop novel nano and inorganic materials to transform the fields of sensing and energy. The specific aims of each of the research activities will provide fundamental insights for the development of new strategies for energy materials, catalysis, sensor surfaces and chemistries, corrosion and surface protection, and new nano and inorganic materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
