 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing a strong cybersecurity workforce. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that the growth rate of employment in cybersecurity will be 35% from 2021 to 2031, a rate that exceeds the average growth rate of all jobs at 5%. Meeting the demand for qualified cybersecurity professionals requires teaching both technical cybersecurity skills and developing a cybersecurity mindset. This project will develop cybersecurity modules using the threat-driven approach resulting in a transferable laboratory framework with hands-on cybersecurity exercises. The framework will utilize the \"build it, break it, and fix it\u201d concept where students build applications based on non-cybersecurity course content, then break the applications by discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities, and then fixing the applications using appropriate cybersecurity practices.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to enable effective cross-module learning that promotes cybersecurity education for computer science students and helps them build a cybersecurity mindset. The project intends to investigate effective learning paths for cybersecurity cross-module learning by 1) identifying appropriate non-cybersecurity computer science courses in which cybersecurity modules can be integrated, 2) designing multi-level integration strategies, and 3) exploring potential linkages among different courses and modules. This project plans to develop cybersecurity modules with curriculum materials using the threat-driven approach to support cross-module learning. This project also intends to tailor and transform learning modules and tools to support K-12 outreach via webinars, summer camps, and online repositories. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. This project is also supported by the NSF IUSE:HSI program, which has the goals of enhancing the quality of undergraduate STEM education, and increasing the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of students pursuing associate\u2019s or baccalaureate degrees in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
