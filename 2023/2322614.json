 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Tennessee Technological University, a comprehensive institution drawing students from the rural Upper Cumberland region. Over its 6-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 45 full-time undergraduate students who are pursuing bachelor\u2019s degrees in biology, chemistry, Earth sciences, mathematics, or physics. First-year students will receive four years of scholarship support. In addition, the project aims to promote student entrance, retention, and success in STEM majors and careers by providing early, targeted, and continuing academic support to Scholars. Supports include early academic support through first-year math classes, multi-layered mentoring, regular cohort-building, undergraduate research, and career-based projects. Supports will occur throughout the Scholars\u2019 tenure, starting with redesigned first-year math courses, as success in these courses is a major factor in retaining students in STEM. This project has potential to broaden participation of students from groups that have been underrepresented in STEM fields, including low-income and rural students, and to inform how planned activities aid in the retention and graduation of more STEM majors from this student population. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion for low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need from economically distressed rural communities. The specific aims of the project are: 1) Promote student entrance, retention, and success in STEM majors through comprehensive financial support; 2) Provide a strong launch of first-year Scholars through early, targeted, and continuing academic and co- curricular support; 3) Establish a sense of belonging among Scholars through cohort-building and mentoring; and 4) Encourage career preparation by facilitating leadership opportunities and real-world client-based projects. Critical thinking skills, self-efficacy, and perceptions of mathematics will be investigated to assess the impact of an early support framework that includes a summer bridge program, re-envisioned first-year math experiences, on-going mentorship, and co-curricular activities. Additionally, recruitment and retention will be assessed through comparison of applicants relative to recruitment efforts, math course success rates, retention in STEM majors, graduation rates, and job placement relative to peers. Annual project evaluation will be conducted using an iterative process of formative and summative assessments.  Results will be compiled and shared with the broader community through conference presentations and publications. This project is funded by NSF\u2019s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
