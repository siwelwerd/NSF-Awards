 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project explores the feasibility of developing future manufacturing processes for renewable and resilient conversion of microalgae to chemical products that are currently produced from fossil resources through traditional chemical synthesis.  Specifically, the project will address an urgent and unmet need for supplying bio-based Methionine (Met), an amino acid widely used in poultry diets. Met is the only chemically synthesized amino acid still allowed in organic poultry diets due to the absence of a bio-based alternative.  The project deviates from traditional (i.e. open pond) microalgae production by utilizing  photobioreactors (PBRs) within greenhouses, thus expanding opportunities to manufacture algae-derived products in cold-climate locations via alternative energy and renewable bio-sources. Although the exploratory seed grant project focuses on Met production, it also includes novel synthesis methods for greenhouse-based microalgae cultivation and process control that may be applicable to a wide range of bio-based products. The project also  incorporates educational activities that will equip a diverse range of students and workforce participants with future manufacturing skills that will promote economic and workforce development as well as benefit the environment and society at many levels.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of the seed project is to develop energy-efficient oxygen-balanced mixotrophic (OBM) microalgae cultivation in combination with artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled system optimization and control to maximize the cost reduction potential of operating in colder-climate environments.  To that end, a team of multidisciplinary experts will 1) investigate and manipulate Met yield within Chlorella sorokiniana (UTEX 1230); 2) design, assemble, and test various PBR designs and process configurations; 3) develop and integrate AI tools for process optimization and control; and 4) perform techno-economic analysis. Although the initial work will focus on the potential for commercialization in Connecticut, the anticipated results will set the stage for further research enabling energy-efficient, near-zero or negative CO2 emission manufacturing of a wide array of microalgae based products across cold-climate regions.   Educational and outreach aspects of the seed project include training students in bioreactor design and operation, developing and running a pilot bootcamp for AI applications for future biomanufacturing, and recruiting students from underrepresented communities for biomanufacturing workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis Future Manufacturing award was supported by the NSF divisions of Chemistry (CHE) and Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET)\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
