 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaboration between two Historically Black Colleges or Universities (HBCUs) and one R1 research institution will form a unique partnership that will benefit all three institutions through sharing resources, exchanging personnel, and engaging students and faculty in the exciting field of time domain, multi-messenger astronomy. The HBCUs are South Carolina State University (SCSU) and the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI), with Clemson University as the R1 partner. Additional collaborators, who are leaders on the Vera Rubin Observatory program, will assist the partnership in participating in the future of ground-based astronomy.  The main research areas are gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), active galactic nuclei (AGN) and pulsating variable stars.  The broader impacts are developing a model partnership of bidirectional/multidirectional benefit among minority serving institutions and a predominately white R1 university, mentoring and support through graduation for undergraduate and masters students from minoritized populations in astronomy and physics, and working with a licensed social worker to mitigate the challenges facing our communities when it comes to stress and mental health.\r\n\r\nThe astronomy research will be concentrated in three areas: (1) the study of GRB outflow mechanisms and environments through discovery and analysis of late-time GRB optical flares; (2) the study of AGN using optical observations correlated to multi-messenger signals to investigate the production of high-energy cosmic rays; and (3) high-precision studies of pulsating variable stars in the era of Rubin science. The partnership has access to a network of four 0.5-1.3m telescopes in both the northern and southern hemispheres covering a wide range in longitude, which allows tracking of objects continuously for 12-18 hours. The team will study short period RR Lyrae stars, delta Scuti stars and Cepheids. Rubin Community Scientists will train faculty and students in preparation for Rubin\u2019s first data release during the third year of the award.  The partners have an existing Bridge to Masters 3+2 B.S.+ M.S. physics memorandum of agreement between Clemson and SCSU. This award will set up a similar arrangement with UVI. Students will benefit from an accelerated program to an M.S., while Clemson will be able to attract highly talented students from a group that is severely underrepresented in these fields. This unique partnership will serve as a model and inspiration to others. The team will closely document successes and challenges through an external evaluator and communicate results to the physics community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
