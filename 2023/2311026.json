 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accelerated and real-time analytics is a leading edge of the smart data revolution, pushed by advances in internet-connected sensor hardware on one side and accelerated AI/ML analytics on the other. These technologies include machine learning, cognitive, quantum, neuromorphic, and edge computing combined with new classes of sensory and programmable hardware components, active storage, flash storage, in-memory cloud systems, and embedded sensors. They address many pursuits of national defense and cybersecurity, weather prediction, health- and disease-monitoring, Industrial IoT, etc. In IUCRC/CARTA Phase II, we will develop new accelerated and real-time approaches to these technologies and their integration relevant to our partners.\r\n\r\nWe will leverage our cutting-edge research in AI/ML and programmable cyber-systems to conduct collaborative CARTA research. Our research areas include accelerated medical image analytics, explainable and interpretable AI/ML for medical and vision/language models, digital twins for dynamical systems with acceleration, and physics-based modeling with AI/ML for improved understanding. Our research will be primarily \u201capplication neutral;\u201d i.e., the techniques can be applied with modifications across multiple industry sectors, including cyber security, healthcare and medical, dynamic systems, environment, and business intelligence. Our exploration will include deep learning, semi-supervised learning, federated learning, architectures, image understanding, real-time simulations, and blockchains.\r\n \r\nOur project will benefit businesses by providing a larger pool of highly skilled workforce. We will disseminate the results of this collaborative research with industry widely by publishing them in appropriate journals and conferences. We will leverage our many programs for our underrepresented students both in the undergraduate and the graduate populations to recruit students for summer internships at our industry partners and to do research in CARTA projects. We will also leverage our MS and PhD in Data Science, Analytics and Engineering programs to find opportunities for the students to do projects as industry interns.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
