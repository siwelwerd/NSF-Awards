 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to provide a pathway for low-income, academically talented students to achieve career and financial upward mobility through equipping them with in-demand skills for ecology and data science, providing targeted cohort experiences and mentorship, and facilitating nature-based recreation and co-curricular activities - all of which are demonstrated high-impact practices. This approach addresses the first goal of the NSF's strategic plan \"to empower STEM talent to fully participate in science and engineering.\" Environmental Science and Data Science are two fields of critical need, each with above-average expected job growth over the next decade. Against this backdrop this project will leverage the unique opportunities afforded by access to the Wild Basin Creative Research Center, as well as the booming technology industry in Austin, Texas. In particular, this project will contribute to workforce development in the convergence of these two critical fields while also providing insights into the effectiveness of student success interventions for low-income STEM majors. The project's findings will be disseminated broadly within the science education community to further expand the reach and impact of the funded activities.\r\n\r\nThe project will provide four-year scholarships of up to $10,000 per year for three cohorts of 7 to 10 students, with eligible students majoring in one of five majors: mathematics, biology, bioinformatics, environmental biology and climate change, or environmental science and policy. Ecology and Data Science Scholars will be recruited through advertising to admitted STEM applicants and targeted high school students, with selection based on unmet financial need, academic potential, and a short application essay. The project will support scholars through intensive faculty mentoring and by leveraging and expanding St. Edward\u2019s University\u2019s existing high-quality evidence-based practices, including student cohorts, first-year seminars, learning communities, undergraduate research, and internships. The project will also implement novel interventions, including: (1) common intellectual experiences focused on ecology, data science, and environmental education; (2) experiential learning at St. Edward\u2019s University\u2019s Wild Basin Creative Research Center; (3) nature-based recreation and wellness opportunities; (4) provision of laptop computers and necessary software; (5) near-peer mentoring; and (6) on-campus employment opportunities related to scholars\u2019 academic fields. Career counseling and placement services will be provided by career coaches (one is assigned to every St. Edward\u2019s University student) and the Office of Career and Professional Development. This project is funded by NSF\u2019s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
