 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have entered a very exciting time in high energy astrophysics with observations accumulating very quickly from a range of observatories including gravitational waves (GW) from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, pulsar X-rays from NICER, supermassive black hole images from the Event Horizon Telescope, and fast radio burst observations from CHIME, and many others.  This tremendous success is spurring the development of future GW observatories, such as LISA, the Einstein Telescope, and the Cosmic Explorer, in addition to new electromagnetic telescopes. And it is in this context that numerical work helps guide and extract the science. These efforts may help elucidate details about the source of r-process elements and the conditions needed for a kilonova.  These studies of the magnetic structure with advanced Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and with neutrino heating and cooling in binary mergers will help develop a better understanding of the engine behind short gamma-ray bursts (sGRB). Training in and development of numerical methods of the type provided through this award is becoming more and more important in an increasing variety of fields.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to push forward the multi-messenger science achieved by studying binary neutron star and black hole--neutron star mergers: (i) continued development of the open-source MHDUET code, a general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamics(GRMHD) code, (ii) test the group's implementation of an M1 neutrino transport scheme with hot neutron stars and binary neutron star mergers, and then progress to a hybrid scheme, and (iii) study the merger and post-merger signals and outflows from binary neutron star mergers with magnetic field with large eddy simulation techniques, realistic equations of state, neutrino heating and cooling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
