 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical description: \r\nJust as we can see the world via electromagnetic waves, one can learn the properties of electronic states in solids by measuring their electromagnetic responses. However, these measurements are sometimes challenging in materials formed by stacks of atomically-thin crystals such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The properties of these materials can give rise to novel quantum states of many electrons, but the characteristic frequencies of such states often fall into the range where the electromagnetic wavelength far exceeds the possible sample size. In this project, the PI develops advanced on-chip THz spectroscopy with integrated sub-wavelength waveguide to study the electromagnetic response of these novel states in TMD heterostructures. The research can advance our fundamental understanding of interacting electrons and lead to new functional THz devices. It can also provide an active learning environment for graduate and undergraduate students to gain interdisciplinary skills. The project engages undergraduate students at UC Berkeley, especially those from underrepresented groups, to drive the frontier of science and technology in the future.\r\n\r\nTechnical description:\r\nThis project aims to investigate the terahertz electrodynamic responses of correlated quantum phases, such as flat-band metals, correlated insulators, and Wigner crystals, in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures. These highly tunable heterostructures have emerged as one of the leading platforms for studying novel states formed by interacting electrons. However, despite the great interest, the electrodynamic properties of these states at their characteristic frequency scales remain largely unknown. In this project, the PI develops advanced on-chip terahertz spectroscopy to study these properties. Specifically, the PI explores three research directions in the project: (1) Studying a new type of 2D plasmon in flat bands with frequency exceeding the upper bound for single electron-hole decay. Such plasmons may have enhanced lifetimes and exhibit properties reflecting the underlying correlated phases. (2) Measuring the full doping evolution of the frequency-dependent conductivity in heterostructures resembling the triangular-lattice Hubbard model, a paradigmatic model of correlated electrons. (3) Investigating the electron vibration modes in Wigner and generalized Wigner crystals, as well as their evolutions across the quantum and thermal melting of these electron crystals. The proposed project can advance our fundamental understanding of the TMD heterostructures and the long-standing correlated electron problem. It also provides an interdisciplinary learning environment for graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
