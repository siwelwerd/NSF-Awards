 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Kentucky to acquire a Hydrogen/Deuterium eXchange (HDX) Mass Spectrometry System. HDX is a cutting-edge technique that will allow researchers to move from static understanding of biomolecule structure to a dynamic view of macromolecules and macromolecular interactions. The system will provide the critical capabilities of a unique and powerful research technology to researchers at the University of Kentucky, to the Appalachian region, and other partner investigators and institutions.  Acquisition of the system will be coupled with initiatives to improve education and training in the Commonwealth and beyond.  The training activities include classes for both students and faculty.  Additionally, outreach through inclusion of PUIs, synergy with Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) programs, and involvement of High School STEM outreach and education will maximize the impact of the acquisition. Overall, this will also result in development of a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce and increasing public scientific literacy and engagement with science technology.  \r\n\r\nRecent advances have positioned HDX as a powerful general technology based on measuring differential solvent accessibility to address key structural, biological, biophysical, and materials questions.  The new HDX system will serve a broad range of users and enable a convergence of research that probes fundamental biological and material systems. Research topics supported by the new system include glucan dikinase function in starch metabolism, flavin-based metabolism studies, viral membrane fusion, DNA repair mechanisms, microtubule assembly, and a range of other interesting subjects.  Data generated will advance key fields including biochemistry, structural biology, biological sciences, biophysics, and materials. To ensure maximum benefit from the HDX equipment, the researchers will ensure dissemination of knowledge through peer-reviewed publications, presentations at scientific meetings, and presentations to the community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
