The award gives early-career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of funding a chance to attend and participate in this conference.  \r\n \r\nThe symposium focuses on recent developments in Analysis, this year especially in the areas of harmonic analysis, fluid dynamics, singularity formation and sphere packing. More information can be found on the symposium web page https://cse.umn.edu/math/riviere-fabes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
