 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by fostering the growing interactions between the mathematics and computer science communities with interests in improving undergraduate education in data science through sports analytics. The project, led by faculty from Davidson College and Johnson C. Smith University, will support the development of a framework of evidence-based practices that support success of mathematics and computer science majors from diverse communities to help them feel included and valued in the field of data analytics.  Project components include the formation of an expert advisory board, a pre-conference meeting with sports industry professionals, a two-day working virtual workshop with participants from various types and sizes of institutions of higher education, and a post-conference report with resources and a framework for future collaboration among institutions. \r\n\r\nProject activities will consider: 1) institutional and cultural barriers to creating multiple educational pathways in data science, 2) tools and infrastructure needed to adapt or implement curriculum innovations, 3) differing challenges and opportunities across varied institution types and student populations, 4) approaches to fairness, ethics, accountability and transparency (FEAT) and 5) leveraging partnerships and bridging gaps through faculty and professional networks across institutions/organizations. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
