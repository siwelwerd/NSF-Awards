 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Saint Augustine\u2019s University seeks to implement curricular enhancements in biology by incorporating plant microbiome course-base undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). In addition, there are efforts to bolster the research capacity of the institution by establishing a Microbiome Research Laboratory, including the necessary equipment to support next generation sequencing experimental analysis. \r\n\r\nThere is evidence to demonstrate CUREs an effective approach to positively impact undergraduate student learning and workforce training outcomes. This project describes efforts to leverage the significance of microbiomes in promoting homeostasis in biological and environmental ecosystems, by developing a sustainable microbiome CUREs framework, and examining the impact of CUREs integration on student perceptions and outcomes. Specifically, CUREs modules will focus on the phyto-microbiomes and consist of discovery-based investigations on the composition and function of microorganisms associated with annual and perennial flowers and other plants. The establishment of the Microbiome Research Laboratory at Saint Augustine's University advances the technological capacity, thereby creating a foundation for a cost-effective and sustainable model research system. Together, the Microbiome Research Laboratory and CUREs modules will facilitate the integration of microbiome data science and additional computational biological investigations in the STEM curriculum, precipitate interdisciplinary research partnerships, and enhance faculty-mentored research programs. Exposure to innovative microbiology, molecular biology, ecology, plant science, and bioinformatics protocols will augment undergraduate readiness for post-graduate opportunities. It is anticipated that data from CUREs efficacy studies on underrepresented students will inform the STEM education research community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
