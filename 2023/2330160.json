Crypto is a top-tier, peer-reviewed, highly selective conference in cryptography, attracting students, researchers and industry specialists from all over the world. The scope of research papers accepted to Crypto range from theoretical foundation of cryptology to application and implementation of cryptographic schemes.\r\n\r\nThe requested funds will be used to support student travel awards, and underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged to apply. Students who otherwise would not be able to attend will be given the chance to deepen their knowledge modern cryptography research and meet researchers and other students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
