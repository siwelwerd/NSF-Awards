 "awd_abstract_narration": "From September 18-20, 2022 Hurricane Fiona delivered more than 64 cm of rainfall to the island of Puerto Rico. This excessive precipitation caused mass wasting and flooding across the island, similar to the effects of Hurricane Mar\u00eda in 2017. Both events represent extraordinary opportunities to study the impact of tropical cyclones on the evolution of a high relief, tropical landscape. This project will support two deployments of scientists and equipment to collect time-sensitive and perishable data from two catchments in southern Puerto Rico strongly impacted by mass wasting after the hurricane. Using these catchments as a model study area the investigators will: 1. survey the topography of landslide deposits, scars, and post-landslide river aggradation using drone-based structure-from-motion photogrammetry; 2. collect samples of river sediment downstream of landslide areas for grain size analysis and cosmogenic nuclide tracing of landslide-derived sediment, 3. monitor and record the movement of still-unstable landslides and actively aggrading river channels with time-lapse cameras. The project will be collaborative with co-investigators based in Puerto Rico and coordinated in concert with federal and local scientists working in hazards assessment and prevention. Field work deployments will engage at least 3 graduate and 3 undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nFor more than sixty years, geologists have debated the contribution of large, yet infrequent storm events to the long-term evolution of eroding landscapes. For large storms like tropical cycles, the immediate geomorphic impact to tropical landscapes may be obvious: mass wasting and flooding. However, the extended response of tropical landscapes to the storm event is often more complex, and measurement of landscape response requires repeated observations across a catchment area, beginning immediately after the storm event. This project supports collection of time-sensitive and perishable data to explore three hypotheses concerning the response of a tropical landscape to landslides and flooding caused by a tropical cyclone. Specifically, the investigators will address the questions: 1. Where (and why) do storm events destabilize hillslopes? by surveying landslide scars and deposits in-person, monitoring still-unstable hillslopes with time-lapse cameras, and mapping landslides regionally with remotely-sensed imagery; 2. How do river networks adjust to an influx of landslide-derived sediment? by measuring channel aggradation/erosion patterns with repeat drone-based topographic surveys and direct tracking of coarse sediment transport using time-lapse images of channels downstream of landslide areas; and 3. What is the residence time of landslide-derived sediment in a tropical landscape? by repeated measurement of cosmogenic radionuclide concentrations in river sediment to detect changes in the flux of landslide-derived sediment over the following year.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project supported rapid collection of topographic, photographic, and geochemical datasets in the year following Hurricane Fiona with two primary goals: 1. make time-sensitive measurements of perishable landforms and deposits before they disappeared, and 2. investigate how hurricanes may transform rivers subject to landsliding and flooding. We successfully collected water and sediment samples for geochemical measurements and samples are currently queued for analysis at Purdue University. We also successfully collected a variety of remote sensing observations, including time-lapse ground photography, drone surveys for structure-from-motion photogrammetry, and satellite images. Results from this work was presented in two student-led presentations at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting and are currently being finalized for publication. Survey data has been submitted to OpenTopography for public access and geochemical data will be archived as it comes available.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts: This project was a successful collaboration between Georgia Tech (GT) and the University of Puerto Rico, Mayag&uuml;ez (UPRM).

All students working on the project are members of groups traditionally underrepresented in the geosciences. GT and UPRM further coordinated with the NSF-sponsored GEER program to draft a technical impact report to share with agencies working to mitigate natural hazards in Puerto Rico.
