 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description: \r\nNaturally derived biomaterials hold tremendous promise for addressing human health concerns, including wound care. However, the promise of many naturally derived biomaterials has not been fully realized, due in part to the field\u2019s lack of understanding regarding how the materials are produced and the ability to tailor the biomaterial properties. This CAREER award supports fundamental research to address this challenge for one such naturally derived material known as insoluble exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by the same bacteria used to make vinegar and kombucha. This project will establish new materials produced by these bacteria and the scientific connection between the properties of the new material and the bacterial machinery used to produce these materials. These new materials will be modified with antibacterial agents for wound care and infection prevention. In addition to scientific research, this project includes integrated educational activities to excite elementary school students and undergraduate students about careers in science and engineering. Hands-on laboratory modules and outreach activities, in partnership with the institution\u2019s STEM Education Center, will be created to inspire interest in material science and biomedical engineering. Integrated research, mentoring and career development opportunities will be provided to undergraduate and graduate level students from underrepresented groups, including students from disadvantaged backgrounds, minorities, and women, to improve retention and increase diversity in the STEM workforce. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description: \r\nThis CAREER award focuses on developing designer insoluble exopolysaccharides (EPSs) from Komagataeibacter species for wound care. These materials have been proposed to possess several important properties for wound dressing including immediate pain relief, high water holding capacity, improve development of granulation tissue, and accelerate re-epithelialization. The Principal Investigator\u2019s team studies bacterial-derived EPSs to improve functionality and uncover the relationship between genotype and phenotype to improve its utility for biomedical applications. In this project, two key properties for wound treatment will be addressed, namely wound visualization and incorporation of antimicrobials. To achieve this, the research team will generate a fundamental understanding of optically transparent bacterial-derived EPSs from the molecular through bulk scale connecting genome to phenome and characterize non-covalent antimicrobial peptide binding, release, and functionality. The long-term educational goal of this CAREER project is to promote and train the next generation of researchers and students developing innovative biomaterials to improve human health. The educational objectives of this project are: 1) inspire elementary school students to become excited about the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math, 2) integrate project-based laboratory modules on bacterial production of biopolymers into an undergraduate course, and 3) provide research training, mentorship, and professional development to first-generation college students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
