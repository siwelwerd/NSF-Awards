 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Training Group (RTG) in Numerical Mathematics and Scientific Computing (NASC) at Rice University will serve national interests by training the next generation of scientists to advance NASC and its applications. NASC are continuously evolving areas which are increasingly important for discovery and decision making in a wide variety of engineering and science applications and beyond. This RTG will train the next generation of scientists to participate and push the advancement of these areas and their applications, it will increase participation, especially of women and underrepresented minorities, in mathematical sciences, and it will strengthen the preparation of researchers in computational and applied mathematics for industry and academic careers. RTG activities will facilitate and increase interactions between RTG trainees and faculty at Rice University and the neighboring MD Anderson Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nRTG participants will be trained in mathematical modeling, the design and analysis of numerical methods, and best practices in scientific software engineering. This training will build mathematical and scientific computing foundations across all applications, but also bring trainees to frontiers of research in areas such as next-generation high-order numerical methods for physics-based simulations, structure-preserving and data-driven reduced order modeling, and large-scale optimization methods for problems governed by differential equations. RTG trainees will also join teams with domain experts from biology, computational neuroscience, and the geosciences in order to understand the specific mathematical and computational challenges arising from each application, and to ultimately provide mathematical and computational tools tailored towards application-specific challenges. Vertically integrated research pods centered around a single application area will provide research and mentoring experiences to postdocs and students. The RTG will broaden and diversify the pool of postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduates who will pursue graduate studies in NASC by providing community-building and professional development activities. Activities are planned to increase the number of undergraduate majors in computational and applied mathematics as well as strengthen their backgrounds for industry and academic careers. The RTG will also introduce a bridge program to facilitate social and academic integration for incoming graduate students. Professional development activities, teaching opportunities, and the integrated research experience will increase the career preparation of graduate students and postdoctoral associates. The RTG program will also enhance the training of non-RTG students via participation in workshops, topics courses, and graduate student seminars. Finally, outreach activities will expose high school students to undergraduate studies in NASC, as well as career opportunities in the mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
