 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Regional Innovation Engines Development Award is focused on convening industrial, R&D, community, workforce, investment and entrepreneurship ecosystem stakeholders across the Southeastern Commerce Corridor (SCC) of Kentucky and Tennessee, to design and develop an innovation ecosystem for next-generation manufacturing and supply chain in the region.  By 2034 the SCC will be a global leader in next-generation manufacturing and supply chain innovation for the circular economy, supported by an inclusive and diverse workforce. The SCC is the heart of the country's manufacturing and supply chains.  Kentucky and Tennessee will have more freight tonnage passing through its borders by 2040 than nearly every other state in the country.  It is no coincidence that four of the country's major logistics companies have their hubs in the SCC.  Moreover, many of the critical components for priority industries, such as metals and electric vehicle (EV) batteries, will be manufactured in this region.  The region comprises high-potential innovation growth centers of Louisville, Lexington, Nashville, Knoxville, and Chattanooga, with premier research universities and a national laboratory leader in next-generation manufacturing research, but also distressed urban communities and a rural region with >50% of its counties qualifying as economically distressed.  Led by the University of Kentucky and 12 other Core Partners, including four R1 research universities, three doctoral universities, an R2 HBCU, a leading national laboratory, the SCC's community college systems, its premier tech-based economic development non-profits, leading industry participants, and the lead organization's state government, the GAME Change Engine is supported by 53 total other collaborating partners in the SCC, including 23 industry partners.\r\n\r\nUtilizing expert-led technical thrusts related to next-generation manufacturing and supply chain, the Development Award aims to establish an innovation ecosystem across the SCC. It will allow the project team to engage the GAME Change industrial and community partners in a comprehensive process - leveraging Major Gap Validation Workshops - designed to identify, validate, consolidate, and prioritize a more focused set of use-inspired technology opportunities and gaps.  The Engine will then leverage GAME Change Summits located in underserved communities across the region to ensure community-based representation and input from diverse stakeholders in producing a GAME Plan for the subsequent phases of the Engine.  A use-inspired research Playbook will establish research scopes to prove concepts. Technology-Scale Centers equipped with venture studios located in underserved communities across the region will be designed to serve as community-engaged venues for testing, scaling, startup development, and workforce training related to resulting innovations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
