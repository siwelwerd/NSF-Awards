 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the fate of organic matter and nutrients delivered to the West Florida Shelf during Hurricane Ian in September 2022. The study will focus on three aspects of this hurricane event: (1) how do bacteria and light alter dissolved organic matter as it is transported offshore, (2) what is the effect of this large pulse of organic matter on inorganic carbon parameters and organic alkalinity, and (3) do nutrients derived from the recycling of this organic matter stimulate harmful algal blooms. Scientists involved in this project collected samples in late August/early September 2022 and in early October 2022, representing conditions just prior to and following Hurricane Ian. They will collect samples again in January 2023. This unique set of samples will enable the team of scientists to study how extreme events influence the carbon cycle in coastal waters. The project will support scientists from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in marine science, including two early career scientists. The broader impacts include student training and outreach activities at each institution.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude and frequency of tropical storms and extreme weather events is expected to increase in response to climate change. This project will add new insights about the effects of these events on the carbon cycle in a unique setting. Hurricane Ian made landfall west of Fort Myers FL on September 28, 2022 as a Category 4 storm and delivered large amounts of dissolved organic matter and nutrients to the West Florida Shelf (WFS). The investigators propose to examine whether the remineralization of allochthonous dissolved organic matter released during this extreme event alters water chemistry and ecological processes on the WFS. The project brings together an interdisciplinary team of scientists with diverse and complementary expertise including organic matter characterization, inorganic carbon measurements, remote sensing and satellite imaging analysis, and stable and radiogenic isotope measurements. The project will provide training opportunities for one graduate student, one undergraduate, and will contribute to education and outreach activities at each of the institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
