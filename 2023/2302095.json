 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mirror symmetry is one of the most mysterious dualities in mathematics. It originated from theoretical physics, and generated great impact on various areas of mathematics, in particular differential geometry and algebraic geometry. The objects of study are geometric shapes called Calabi-Yau manifolds that appear naturally in different contexts of mathematics and physics. Mirror symmetry predicts that given any Calabi-Yau manifold, there exists a mirror manifold, such that an ever-growing list of geometric relations hold between the two, involving deep and elaborate invariants that are otherwise unrelated. Despite the continual progress in the subject, both the full extent of existence of mirror manifolds and the underlying mathematical mechanism of mirror symmetry remain unsolved today. This project brings a new approach to the study of mirror symmetry, based on latest developments from non-archimedean geometry. The goal is to conceive and pursue a full-fledged theory of non-archimedean mirror symmetry, which will lead to new results unattainable from existing methods, as well as applications beyond the current scope. This award will also support graduate and undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nThe mirror existence problem will be studied via the enumeration of analytic curves with boundaries in non-archimedean SYZ torus fibrations of Calabi-Yau manifolds. New constructions of such fibrations will be explored using non-archimedean Monge-Amp\u00e8re equations in addition to the minimal model program. An analog of the Gromov compactness theorem for non-archimedean curves with boundaries needs to be established, based on generalized tail conditions, which depend on novel analytic surgeries of the target spaces. The construction of virtual fundamental classes for the curve counts will rely on our previous works on derived non-archimedean geometry. PI will prove various properties of the mirror algebra obtained from the curve counts, including associativity, radius of convergence and singularity estimates. The local mirror algebras are expected to glue together to form the global mirror variety using wall-crossing formulas. A long-term goal is to show that the mirror construction is an involution, the best exhibition of mirror duality. PI also aims for applications outside mirror symmetry, in particular towards cluster algebras in representation theory and the moduli of KSBA stable pairs in birational geometry. PI expects fruitful future interactions with the Gross-Siebert program based on logarithmic geometry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
