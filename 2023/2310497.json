 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professor Kirtimaan Mohan at Michigan State University.\r\n\r\nSeveral experiments around the world, such as the Large Hadron Collider at the CERN Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, are collecting large volumes of data to study how the building blocks of matter --- namely fundamental particles such as quarks and leptons --- interact and behave. Our current understanding of these fundamental particles and their interactions is deficient and new physical laws are needed in order to explain several observed phenomena, such as the existence of dark matter. Greater precision from both theory and experiment is necessary in order to test and discover such new physical laws.  Professor Mohan\u2019s research will help implement modern tools and methods to improve our search for new physics laws by using modern machine learning methods, refining theoretical calculations, and designing novel search methods. This research aligns with and supports the mission of the National Science Foundation to promote the progress of basic science. This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  Professor Mohan will involve graduate students and postdocs in his research, and thereby provide critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this field.  Additionally, Professor Mohan will engage in outreach activities and help improve undergraduate education in physics using research based pedagogical practices.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the search for new physics requires more precise theoretical calculations and predictions as well as novel ways to explore and test the phenomenology of different new physics scenarios. Professor Mohan\u2019s research will touch upon all of these aspects. For example, Professor Mohan will use modern machine learning techniques to provide a more accurate estimate of uncertainties in Parton Distribution Functions. Additionally, Professor Mohan will explore novel ideas and signals for new physics scenarios as well as refine calculations in new physics models to provide more accurate theoretical predictions of such models. Professor Mohan will also engage in broader-impact activities which involve service to the larger physics community, mentoring with an explicit goal of promoting diversity, engaging in outreach activities, and improving undergraduate education and curriculum using evidence-based practices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
