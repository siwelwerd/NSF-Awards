 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cnidarian Model Systems Meeting (\u201cCnidofest 2022\u201d) will take place September 7-10, 2022 at the University of California in Davis, California. This meeting will focus on cnidarians, a group of mostly marine animals that includes jellyfish, sea anemones, and corals, with a focus on cnidarians that are used as model organisms in the laboratory for molecular research to uncover the mechanisms underlying basic biological processes. Cnidarian model systems are growing in popularity due to dramatic advances in technology that now allow for sophisticated mechanistic studies; these studies are expected to have significant impact on many areas of society, including human health. Traditionally, most scientists have studied only a handful of model organisms because importing tools to new animals was a significant barrier. This has limited our understanding of biology because entire taxa remained severely understudied, including the cnidarians. However, due to significant and rapid advances in technology over the past 10-20 years, the number of laboratory model organisms has grown tremendously. This includes many emerging cnidarian models that will be featured at our meeting. A growing number of laboratories are applying these new technologies to cnidarians and making rapid progress in many fields, including developmental biology, cell biology, neurobiology, immunology, evolutionary biology, and ecology. Our meeting will highlight new tools that have already been implemented, introduce attendees to cutting edge technologies that may be applied to their future research, and facilitate the exchange of information between cnidarian scientists. This sharing of ideas will positively impact the advances we are able to make as a community. To ensure the healthy growth of our field, we will emphasize interactions between experienced scientists and trainees, with a focus on increasing diversity.\r\n\r\nCnidarians are excellent laboratory models for making fundamental biological discoveries in many scientific fields, including neurobiology, developmental biology, immunology, and ecology. New advances in technology are now allowing scientists to apply sophisticated technological approaches to this historically understudied group of animals. The advantages of cnidarians are many: 1) They have simple, well-understood body plans and interesting life cycles with high variability. 2) They hold an informative phylogenetic position as the clade that is sister to bilaterians; discoveries made in cnidarians are often reflective of deeply conserved processes. 3) Many life stages of cnidarians are transparent, making them amenable to live imaging. 4) Some cnidarians are models for studying self/non-self recognition and others are used to study intracellular symbioses, such as those found in reef-building corals. 5) Many cnidarians are great models for studying regeneration, stem cells, and aging. Our meeting will emphasize new technological approaches that will greatly enhance cnidarian research. Three technology speakers will present seminars on emerging technologies 1) CryoEM, 2) single cell multiomics, and 3) live imaging. In addition, we will choose abstracts that emphasize the development of new technologies, including science supported by NSF Enabling Discovery through GEnomics (EDGE) awards. Interactions will be fostered among participants through a schedule that includes oral presentation sessions, lightning talks, poster presentations, and free time to encourage informal discussion over breaks and meals, which are all done as one group. The goal is to exchange ideas for advancing technology in cnidarians, as well as to foster growth in the community through trainee support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As the sister group to most animals, they are critical to understanding the origin of animal features. Cnidarians have simple, but diverse, body plans, and are used to study features that are difficult to access in other organisms. For example, cnidarians have recently emerged as useful models for neuroscience because even though they have simple nervous systems, the molecular processes governing their nervous systems are deeply conserved. Cnidarians also have many unique traits and properties making them useful for addressing questions across diverse biological disciplines, including the ability to regenerate their entire bodies and to build multiple body plans from a single genome. The goal of this project was to organize a conference (Cnidarian Models System Meeting, aka Cnidofest) to bring together the community of researchers that study cnidarians, with a focus on supporting trainees. While cnidarians have already been used to make foundational discoveries in regenerative biology, developmental biology, and neurobiology, they have the potential to impact many other areas of biology if the community continues to expand and develop new tools. The community of researchers that study these animals is substantial, but still small relative to other &lsquo;model system&rsquo; communities. Growing and supporting the community is key to more rapid advancement in developing experimental methods. At this meeting, we emphasized exchanging ideas on the technical aspects of working with cnidarians, and we invited four speakers from outside of the community to speak about advanced methods in imaging, genomics, and in developing new model systems. Overall, this meeting provided a venue for the international community of cnidarian biologists to meet, exchange ideas, form new collaborations, and mentor the next generation of researchers. Critical to our community growth, we prioritized supporting our trainees at this meeting. We had 127 attendees and 75% of these were trainees. Accordingly, 75% of the oral presentations at the conference were given by students and postdoctoral researchers. In addition, almost all junior researchers presenting a poster also presented their work in a two-minute lightning talk that preceded the poster session. This grant helped us achieve this high percentage of trainee attendance by supporting 63 free registrations for trainees. To determine the overall satisfaction of attendees and to plan for future meetings, we conducted a post-conference survey that was taken by 50% of our attendees. Of those that took our survey, 94% agreed that the talk format was effective and that the meeting achieved a good balance of junior and senior researchers. Impressively, 97% of the survey respondents rated the quality of the science presented as either high or very high, which is a strong endorsement of our trainees. Our post-conference survey also indicated that the majority of attendees (79%) plan to attend the next Cnidofest conference, which is a testament to the success of Cnidofest 2022. Cnidofest 2024 is scheduled to be held on the campus of Lehigh University August 14-17, 2024 and planning is well underway. The establishment of this biennial conference, which started in 2018 with NSF support, for cnidarian researchers has served as a focal point for our growing and diversifying our community and for highlighting discoveries and advances with cnidarians.</span></p>\n<div><span><br /></span></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/24/2024<br>\nModified by: Celina&nbsp;Juliano</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
