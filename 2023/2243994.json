 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the California Academy of Sciences, located in San Francisco, California, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2022\u20132024. Research will primarily be conducted at the Academy and at local field sites in Sonoma County, California. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from underrepresented groups, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done through the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be required to register in the NSF ETAP system (etap.nsf.gov) and tracked after the program to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nThe Academy\u2019s Institute for Biodiversity Science and Sustainability is a research hub focused on understanding the natural world and finding solutions to sustaining it. The institution houses world-class natural history research collections, along with the modern-day technology and genomics tools needed to study these specimens. Participants of the Summer Systematics Institute REU will begin the summer with fieldwork and immersive workshops, before returning to the Academy to be paired with 1:1 mentors, our curators and research scientists, to work on original research projects and attend seminars which provide tools in the field of systematics and phylogenetics. The students\u2019 summer culminates with scientific and popular writing and giving an oral presentation to the community in our final symposium. Students apply through an online application system and will be recruited from universities and community colleges across the country. Applicants identify potential mentors during the application process, and applications are competitively reviewed by advisors who make the final selection of participants. More information about the program is available by visiting https://www.calacademy.org/summer-systematics-institute, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Lauren Esposito at lesposito@calacademy.org) or the co-PI (Dr. Rebecca Johnson at rjohnson@calacademy.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
