 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several different elements with specific chemical signatures, or isotopes, have been measured in bones of living and fossil species to help researchers reconstruct information regarding diet, migration, and reproduction. The measurement of stable isotopes of transition metals such as zinc, iron, and copper, could also be applied to the study of living or fossil primate bone to provide additional insight into these factors.  This project measures transition metal isotopes in bone from primate individuals, and links them to information known from these individuals during life, to better understand how these markers might help reconstruct information about meat consumption and infant feeding patterns from fossilized bone. The results of this project also provide information about how individual- and sex-specific differences in metabolism influence these measurements. This is a multi-institutional collaborative project that includes mentoring of undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in STEM, community outreach, and presentations to local schools.\r\n\r\nThis research has three main aims: 1) Are the breastfeeding and weaning patterns of primates recorded by \u03b466Zn values in enamel bioapatite and bone? 2) How does infrequent meat consumption affect the \u03b466Zn values measured in bioapatite? 3) Do sex- related differences in Fe and Cu fractionation occur in primates and does the degree of female reproductive investment affect these values? Analytic approaches include transition isotope analysis using mass spectrometry, and the application of a logistic regression with a machine learning algorithm to predict diet category (frugivorous/herbivorous or omnivorous/meat consuming) and trophic position of the samples. Transition metals (Zn, Fe, Cu) have the potential to be indicators of trophic position (\u03b466Zn), sex and reproductive state (\u03b456Fe and \u03b465Cu) in prehistoric and even fossil skeletal elements with poor organic preservation. This study aims to establish a reference dataset for nonhuman primates that serves as the first application of this technique in wild primates, with the potential to dramatically expand the use of transition metals in archaeological science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This dataset enabled the identification of different feeding behaviors in wild chimpanzees, as well as provided a context for addressing broader evolutionary questions, such as the potential to use Fe and Cu stable isotopes in fossil hominins to assess reproductive status. First, we found that stable Zn isotope ratios are a more reliable and sensitive dietary proxy for indicating low levels of meat consumption in chimpanzees than nitrogen stable isotopes. This method can be applied to archaeological sites that have poor preservation of organic material, allowing the exploration of diets in deep time. Specifically, it enables researchers to address questions of meat consumption during human evolution and estimate when meat became an important dietary resource for modern humans. Second, we show that Fe and Cu stable isotopes suggest no sex difference related to female reproductive cycles in chimpanzees, and in fact, chimpanzees metabolize Fe and Cu differently when compared to humans. However, bonobos might have a faster, or higher turnover of Fe and Cu, which could be related to their longer cycles. The drastic difference between bonobos and chimpanzees may encourage future studies to explore how Fe and Cu is metabolized in the bodies of different taxa, and how this could change our understanding of reproductive strategies during human evolution. Specifically, in how Fe and Cu stable isotopes may be used to indicate reproductive status and the metabolism of Fe and Cu in females relative to males.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the course of this research, RB mentored two undergraduate students, as well as co-founded a mentoring program with Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE).
