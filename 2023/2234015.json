 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving preservice teachers\u2019 evidence-based teaching practices through an interactive program with personalized feedback. Teachers\u2019 conceptual understanding of mathematics as well as their understanding of how students learn, and their repertoire of instructional tools and practices, are essential for implementing teaching practices that will lead students to develop command of concepts. Yet preservice teachers may have varying degrees of access to learning opportunities, depending on their location or the teacher preparation program in which they enroll. This project will address this issue through a program that is accessible to elementary and middle grade preservice teachers anywhere and at any time focused on teaching of ratios and proportional relationships, an area of persistent challenge for learners. Adaptation of a protype that was found effective in improving in-service teachers\u2019 mathematics teaching and students\u2019 mathematics learning is a basis for this work. Preparation of a teaching workforce with strengthened content-specific knowledge and teaching skills can create learning environments for students to attain command of STEM concepts. This project hopes to advance understanding of preservice teachers\u2019 learning and contribute new knowledge about how an interactive program that uses artificial intelligence can improve preservice teachers\u2019 knowledge and practices.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to enhance preservice teachers\u2019 mathematical content knowledge (CK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and teaching skills through the development of a program that uses natural language processing to provide instant, personalized feedback. Teachers\u2019 CK and PCK have been identified as essential for teachers to implement teaching practices that lead students in developing deep conceptual knowledge. Although a prototype of the program has been found effective in improving in-service teachers\u2019 practices and their students\u2019 learning, the issue of how a similar program might be designed for preservice teachers, who differ from in-service teachers in terms of their knowledge and experience, has not been examined. The extent to which natural language processing can reliably detect preservice teachers\u2019 responses will also be researched in the project. The program will be developed and refined through an interactive design cycle, based on feedback from instructors of mathematics methods courses and from preservice teachers. The effectiveness of the program on preservice teachers\u2019 knowledge and teaching practices will then be examined through a randomized controlled trial with a sample of 200 preservice teachers drawn from at least eight universities across the nation. The following questions will be investigated: How well does the intelligent, interactive computer-based program with just-in-time feedback enhance preservice teachers\u2019 CK and PCK? and What is the impact of the intelligent, interactive computer-based program with just-in-time feedback on preservice teachers\u2019 teaching of ratios and proportional relationships? An Advisory Board of experts will provide independent feedback throughout the three phases of the project. The final version of the program will be made freely available online. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning Track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
