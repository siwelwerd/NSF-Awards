 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference brings together members of the scientific community, graduate students, postdocs, and early career scientists to discuss new, cutting-edge research in chemical oceanography and marine chemistry. The National Science Foundation, along with the Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of 15 Discussion Leaders and Speakers as well as 20 graduate students, postdocs, or early career investigators attending this conference. In addition, this award will support early career participants (postdocs and students) attending the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), a 2-day workshop held prior to the GRC meeting that aims to build a cohort of early career chemical oceanographers. \r\n\r\nThe 2023 Gordon Research Conference on Chemical Oceanography will be held at Southern New Hampshire University on July 16-21, 2023. The primary goal of the conference is to provide a forum that brings together scientists who are leading contributors in the field of marine chemistry along with graduate students and postdocs to exchange ideas on new, innovative research. Presentations and discussions at the 2023 Gordon Research Conference will revolve around the theme of \"Tracers in the Sea\u201d with a focus on the molecules, elements, and isotopes that are used as tracers of biogeochemical and physical processes in the past and the present ocean. Session topics at the 2023 Gordon Research Conference include: (1) Tracers of Biogeochemical Processes in the Sea; (2) Geochemical Proxies; (3) Vertical Export; (4) Life at the Margins and its Influence on Ocean Chemistry; (5) Emerging Anthropogenic Impacts on Ocean Chemistry; (6) Anthropogenic Tracers in the Sea; (7) Gases in the Ocean\u2019s Interior; and (8) Controls on Dissolved Organic Matter Accumulation. There will also be a session on Late-Breaking Topics. The Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference has become recognized as an important venue to exchange ideas in the interdisciplinary field of marine chemistry and to forge new scientific collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
