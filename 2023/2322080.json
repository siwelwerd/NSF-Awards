 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ecological breadth of the animal kingdom is remarkable, with some groups displaying a wide range of strategies whereas others pursue few. The causes of this variation are of great interest to those studying the nature of innovation. However, the lack of an objective way to measure this variation has hindered progress. This project leverages a new quantitative database of life habits that encompasses all known marine animal genera. A partnership between two mid-career faculty at predominantly undergraduate institutions, the project tests four hypotheses that will result in the first-ever statistical description of how ecological diversity across all major animal groups has changed through time. In addition to providing novel statistical and visualization methods for studying biological history, the results will promote the progress of science by advancing knowledge of the limits and opportunities for innovation. Societal and educational impacts include supporting diverse undergraduate students of underrepresented minorities in research experiences, production of free museum learning modules, and public presentations.\r\n\r\nStatistical documentation of how different animal clades (phyla and classes) have varied ecologically\u2014among clades, through geological time, and in relation to convergence on similar adaptive strategies\u2014can transform investigations into how evolutionary and ecological opportunities have impacted the history of life on Earth. This project integrates novel and existing big-data platforms and recent analytical advances to build the largest-ever, open-source database of fossil marine ecology, body sizes, and stratigraphic ranges. Collaboration between the PI and a statistician at Swarthmore College will provide new statistical and visualization methods to allow next-generation analyses of ecospaces and morphospaces. Public presentations and creation of educational modules for the Jurica-Suchy Nature Museum will increase public awareness of how fossils can help answer pressing ecological and evolutionary questions. Support for summer REU and semester-long research experiences will expand participation and mentoring of underrepresented minorities in STEM science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
