 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide faster internet speeds to remote locations. This goal will be accomplished through the delivery of custom-shaped reflector panels for satellite communication antennas.  Currently, there is a significant unmet need in the market for rapid turnaround, relatively low quantity, and affordable curved metal panels with complex, high precision shapes.  The manufacturing technology developed in this project may enable economical antenna design and allow for asymmetric panel shapes.  The expected advancement in panel fabrication techniques may increase the efficiency of satellite communication by enabling more complex and tailored designs for individual applications.  Expanded satellite communication allows for more internet access in underserved communities around the world.  The new manufacturing technology may also benefit radio astronomy, with some estimates showing a 70% reduction in dish reflector costs for some large near-term projects.   \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop a new technology to make satellite dish panels. This innovation may reduce cost and allow radio antenna producers to optimize their designs for faster data throughput.  To meet modern communication needs, application-specific, precision manufactured reflector panels are needed.  Historic manufacturing techniques have long lead times and high material costs.  This project builds on past efforts and demonstrations to integrate innovative inspection methods and new manufacturing techniques into an automatic workstation capable of fabricating 1-meter squared scale reflector panels.  Test panels will be built to evaluate system performance against key performance indicators, including panel shape accuracy and time to shape and inspect panels.  This new approach may produce panels up to 11 times faster than some traditional methods without compromising shape accuracy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
