 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project investigates the chemical reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas, with hydrogen (H2) to produce methanol for either energy generation (via methanol fuel cells) or use as a platform chemical for the synthesis of a wide range of fuel and chemical products. Novel features associated with this Early-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project include 1) exploring a reaction engineering approach involving cyclic CO2 capture-conversion enabled by dual reactors and 2) incorporating new experimental capabilities allowing research at high pressures characteristic of commercial reactors. More broadly, the project investigates a strategy to close the carbon cycle by in-situ capture of produced CO2 and its conversion with H2 (obtained from water using sustainable energy) to methanol. \r\n\r\nThe EAGER project is a spinoff from the investigator's CAREER project. The CAREER project is focused on the synthesis and evaluation of dual-function materials (DFMs) capable of both capturing and converting CO2, with corresponding benefits of avoiding energy demands, corrosion, and transportation issues associated with CO2 capture and sequestration. The project fulfills the EAGER criteria in that the transformative potential is weighed against the inherent risk associated with kinetic and thermodynamic challenges in converting waste CO2 to methanol and other high-value molecules. The project thus provides an entry point to circularity in low- or net-zero greenhouse gas production of chemicals and fuels.  For example, in the fuel case, the combustion of methanol (or derivative fuel products) will generate CO2 that can be cycled back to methanol via the starting reaction. The project will develop methods to conduct CO2 capture-conversion cyclic studies in such a way that the CO2 capture takes place in the first reactor while the conversion occurs in the second one, with switching every few minutes. From an energetic point of view, the system benefits from operation under isothermal and isobaric conditions. The project is enhanced by technical expertise brought by an experienced post-doctoral associate, who will be mentored by the PI in developing leadership and project management skills needed for a successful independent research career.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
