 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the crucial role of herbivores in shaping temperate nearshore subtidal reefs and kelp forests, and the potential impacts of climate change on the balance between consumption by herbivores and growth by primary producers. By utilizing an upwelling gradient spanning coastal California as a natural laboratory, and controlled experiments, the study aims to deepen our understanding of the complex interacting effects of temperature and oxygen availability on herbivore physiology and performance. This research holds significant implications for advancing the field of ocean sciences, promoting the progress of science, and addressing the national interest. Herbivores, such as the chosen model organism Mesocentrotus franciscanus, play a fundamental role in maintaining the dynamics and productivity of marine ecosystems. The ecological, economic, and cultural importance of M. franciscanus makes it an ideal focal species for this investigation. Through in-situ observations, laboratory experiments, and functional 'omics' analyses, the project seeks to elucidate the physiological responses of M. franciscanus to temperature and oxygen variations. By quantifying individual-level herbivore energetics, population demographics, and community structure, the study will shed light on the intricate mechanisms underlying the relationship between climate change and herbivory in temperate ecosystems. These findings will not only advance our scientific knowledge but also have broader implications for ecosystem conservation and management strategies. Moreover, the project aligns with the Division of Ocean Sciences mission by addressing fundamental issues related to the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems. It supports education and diversity through partnerships with middle and high schools, undergraduate research opportunities, and public engagement initiatives. By engaging underrepresented minorities in STEM fields and broadening participation in scientific research, this project aims to inspire the next generation of scientists and enhance the diversity of the STEM workforce. Ultimately, this research serves the national interest by contributing to the progress of science, promoting the welfare of coastal communities, and fostering a sustainable approach to marine ecosystem management.\r\n\r\nThis project encompasses a comprehensive investigation into the effects of temperature and oxygen availability on herbivory and its implications for temperate nearshore subtidal reefs and kelp forests. The research will be conducted along a temperate upwelling gradient in coastal California, encompassing diverse environmental conditions representative of this region. The study will combine in-situ observations, laboratory experiments, and functional 'omics' analyses to provide a multi-dimensional understanding of the effects of temperature and oxygen availability on herbivore physiology, grazing rates, and emergent population dynamics in kelp forests. The goals of the project include quantifying individual-level herbivore energetics, population demographics, and community structure in response to varying temperature and oxygen conditions. By integrating physiological measurements, population modeling, and community-level analyses, the project aims to unravel the underlying processes shaping the performance of M. franciscanus and its ecological consequences within temperate subtidal ecosystems. The functional 'omics' analyses will provide mechanistic insight into the gene expression patterns of the whole organism \"holobiont\" and the sea urchin microbiome, revealing the molecular mechanisms that drive herbivore responses to changing environmental conditions. The outcomes of this research will contribute new knowledge to the field by providing a comprehensive understanding of the physiological constraints on herbivory in temperate nearshore ecosystems. The project will enhance our understanding of the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems, contribute to ecological modeling efforts, and inform conservation strategies for coastal regions. Furthermore, by engaging with middle and high school students, undergraduate researchers, and the general public through exhibits and outreach programs, this project will foster science education, broaden participation in STEM, and raise awareness about the importance of marine ecosystem conservation. The benefits of this project extend beyond academia, benefiting society by supporting the sustainable management of coastal resources and inspiring future generations to pursue scientific careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
