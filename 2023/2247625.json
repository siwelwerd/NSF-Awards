 "awd_abstract_narration": "The understanding of the genetic basis for plants' uptake and tolerance of heavy metals remains limited. This study aims to investigate the mechanisms by which Nerium oleander, commonly known as oleander, absorbs and withstands heavy metals in its surroundings. By analyzing the plant's genetic composition and investigating gene activation and suppression, scientists seek to unravel the mechanisms that enable Nerium oleander to thrive in polluted areas. This research holds societal relevance as it tackles environmental concerns such as pollution and its impact on ecosystems. What sets this research apart is its innovative approach of employing transcriptomics, which involves studying gene activity, to gain insights into how Nerium oleander copes with heavy-metal contamination. By elucidating the genetic foundation of heavy-metal uptake and tolerance, this study could have far-reaching implications for ecological restoration, phytoremediation (the use of plants to remediate polluted sites), and sustainable agricultural practices. This project thus, represents a significant scientific endeavor that could yield valuable knowledge to address urgent environmental challenges. Overall, this research contributes to the advancement of scientific understanding, offers support for sustainable solutions, and promotes the well-being of our environment and society.\r\n\r\nThe Genetic Mechanisms that regulate heavy-metal uptake and tolerance in plants is poorly understood. This study aims to explore the genetic basis behind Nerium oleander's remarkable ability to absorb and withstand heavy metals in contaminated environments. Specifically, the study seeks to investigate how Nerium oleander can effectively take in and endure heavy metals like cadmium, lead, and zinc without experiencing detrimental effects. The primary objectives of this research include unraveling the molecular pathways and gene regulatory networks that contribute to heavy-metal uptake and tolerance in this plant species. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis will be conducted. RNA samples from plants subjected to heavy-metal stress, as well as control conditions, will be sequenced, enabling the identification and quantification of gene expression patterns. By comparing the transcriptomes of stressed and non-stressed plants, differentially expressed genes associated with heavy-metal uptake and tolerance will be discovered. The project will involve functional enrichment analysis, aiming to identify key transcription factors and signaling pathways involved in the plant's response to heavy-metal stress. By integrating diverse data sets and employing various biological approaches, a comprehensive understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying heavy-metal uptake and tolerance in Nerium oleander will be achieved. The findings of this research will not only contribute to the broader field of plant stress responses but also provide a foundational understanding of the mechanisms involved in phytoremediation\u2014the use of plants to mitigate pollution. This study represents a crucial step towards unraveling the genetic complexities of heavy-metal tolerance in plants and may pave the way for future advancements in sustainable environmental remediation strategies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
