 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most important events for the international reaction engineering scientific community have historically been the International Symposia on Chemical Reaction Engineering. The 27th International Symposium on Chemical Reaction Engineering (ISCRE 27) was organized to take place June 11-14, 2023, in Qu\u00e9bec City, Canada. This symposium provides a focus on the frontiers of chemical reaction engineering related to sustainability, with an opportunity for international networking within the scientific community. ISCRE meetings are held biennially, rotating between North America, Europe, and Asia. This international reputation combined with the efforts of the organizing and scientific committees ensures a vibrant and diverse mix of participants, which offers supported students and researchers the opportunity to engage and learn about the practical technology challenges facing companies that apply chemical reaction engineering expertise. The conference organizers anticipated approximately 330 in-person attendees from academia, industry, and government based on previous ISCRE conferences held in North America. Funding requested from the National Science Foundation will be utilized to support the travel of early-career faculty, post-doctoral researchers, and graduate students, with an emphasis on participation of underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe ISCRE 27 technical program is focused on the challenges of sustainable development and how chemical reaction engineers can address these challenges through their work. The Scientific Committee comprises sixty leading academic and industrial researchers in sustainable chemical engineering from around the world. Technical Sessions cover emerging sustainable engineering focus areas such as CO2 Capture & Utilization, Electrocatalysis & Photocatalysis, Electrification of Chemicals Manufacturing, Waste Upcycling, Hydrogen Production and Storage, and Biomass Conversion. A combination of more than 150 oral presentations and 150 poster presentations were planned to give students and early career researchers a forum for sharing their work and expertise. Technical Workshops will offer students the ability to learn additional practical skills such as Laboratory Reaction Engineer (taught by Dow experts), Technical Writing, and Reactor Scale-up Techniques. The awarded NSF funds will subsidize expenses such as registration, travel, and hotel accommodations for students, postdocs, and researchers. The nominee\u2019s CV and presentation abstract along with any recommendation letters from research advisors were evaluated by the ISCRE 27 Scientific Committee as the merit for the travel awards. The diverse makeup of the conference attendees also presents the awardees the possibility for international technical exchanges and cooperation. Supported attendees will be able to submit their research for publication in special issues of Chemical Engineering Journal and Chemical Engineering Science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
