 "awd_abstract_narration": "The eruption of Mauna Loa, Earth\u2019s largest volcano, is an opportunity to greatly increase new information about natural hazards, and how scientists and students learn about volcanoes. By acquiring new footage of the eruption and surroundings, interviews with Native Hawaiian scientists, students, and others, this project hopes to extend the impact of geoscience research, outreach, and education by providing timely and effective media products that are distributed to a wide audience via public television and the internet. The goal is to provide a better understanding geological phenomena and their impact on diverse communities as well as the scientific research and indigenous knowledge of Native Hawaiian scientists.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to work on updating earth science\u2019s fundamental theory of plate tectonics by studying the eruption of the Mauna Loa volcano. By showing the lessons learned and the indigenous knowledge of Native Hawaiian scientists, the knowledge base in the geosciences becomes better informed regarding geological hazards like volcanos, earthquakes, landslides, and floods. Additionally, this project can address the need for diversity in the field by inspiring youth from underrepresented communities to pursue careers in geoscience. The activities and products include filming new footage in Hawaii, incorporating new content into a one-hour documentary film (Planet of the Plates), creating a website that contains a series of short videos and learning materials, and conducting formative and summative evaluation to determine the effectiveness of the products. The video footage and educational content will be formatively evaluated using focus groups and surveys of diverse scientists, educators, and community members. An overall assessment, summative evaluation, of whether the project goals are being achieved will be determined by analyzing viewer data from PBS, the companion website, and the Internet (YouTube channel).\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, which supports projects committed to: (a) research and practice that illuminates informal STEM learning's role in equity and belonging in STEM; (b) personal and educational success in STEM; (c) advancing public engagement in scientific discovery; (d) fostering interest in STEM careers; (e) creating and enhancing the theoretical and empirical foundations for effective informal STEM learning; (f) improving community vibrancy; and/or (g) enhancing science communication and the public's engagement in and understanding of STEM and STEM processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIntellectual Merit: This is an outreach and education media project designed to raise the public's awareness of new relevant earth science research worldwide. The project involved acquiring video footage of the Mauna Loa volcano eruption in Hawaii and of geoscientists doing research there and in California, and then incorporating the new content into Planet of the Plates, a one-hour television documentary. Planet of the Plates follows diverse groups of geoscientists as they collaborate on international research in a dozen locations globally, unearthing exciting new insights into geology's fundamental theory, the theory of plate tectonics, and revealing how plate tectonics shapes the earth and exerts a major influence on peoples' lives. The documentary was completed and evaluated and will appear on public television both in the United States and internationally, and on major streaming outlets in the near future. This project also created a series of short videos and learning materials that will further the content's usefulness in classrooms and online learning environments, including Earth Images Foundation's website. The project directors are geologist-filmmaker Doug Prose and Diane LaMacchia of Earth Images Foundation, producers of earth science media content for large and diverse audiences.\r\n\n\nBroader Impacts: These products feature international collaborations of researchers whose work in dramatic geologic locations around the globe is helping to update earth science's fundamental theory, plate tectonics. Aimed at a wide audience, Planet of the Plates and its related materials are designed to significantly raise awareness of plate tectonics processes and how geoscientists study its many complexities, particularly in areas that are highly susceptible to tectonically-induced hazards such as volcanoes and earthquakes. This project's content shows how geoscience research contributes to improved public safety and well-being in vulnerable areas. Another impact is to inspire young viewers and students, including those who live in regions at risk, to take a greater interest in pursuing careers in geoscience, thereby addressing the anticipated shortage of personnel in the field and deepening the ability of the geosciences to maintain its critical mission and responsiveness in a rapidly changing world. Public support for earth science and hazard mitigation research will also be strengthened through portrayals of the relevant work of geoscientists who apply novel and cutting edge scientific methods to solving problems.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/17/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DougProse\n"
