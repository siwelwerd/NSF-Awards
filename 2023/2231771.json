 "awd_abstract_narration": "The variety of forces that can cause bones to break presents challenges for reconstructing bone fracture patterns in bioarchaeological and forensic contexts. Researchers therefore rely on experimental research and comprehensive examination of real-world case studies to more accurately determine the cause of fractures. This doctoral dissertation research project examines relatively understudied skeletal fracture patterns caused by high-velocity forces, advancing fundamental knowledge about physical trauma patterns in the past and present. The results of this project also can aid in identification of military personnel from previous conflicts, distinguish between blast and other types of trauma in humanitarian contexts, and provide important threat assessment data for military and law enforcement personnel. The project supports K-12 science outreach activities as well as student training and mentoring opportunities in STEM for women and underrepresented scholars at a Hispanic-serving institution. \r\n\r\nThis project provides an important resource for investigating blast events and for developing a more comprehensive understanding of skeletal trauma. Data collected for this project come from medical examiner and coroner offices from across the country, from warfare trauma of previous conflicts, and from experimental research. These data are analyzed with respect to demographic characteristics, trauma information (including location, type, and direction), and type and cause of blast. In addition, trauma details from comparative traumatic events are collected to further examine how blast events differ from other trauma events. Spatial and data analyses are used to assess spatial distribution patterns of trauma and trends in trauma event types. Through the fracture triad, which states that fracture behavior is influenced by the internal (bone structure) and external (force, size of impacting object) factors, these studies can enhance understanding of what determines the shape and pattern of fractures and help to validate current forensic methods.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
