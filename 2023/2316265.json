The conference will focus on discussing thermodynamic and kinetic modeling and experiments for advanced materials like alloys, ceramics, and polymers used in both structural and functional applications. It will also cover fundamental materials science education, innovation for future materials, and manufacturing techniques. The conference will offer opportunities for young researchers and students to learn from industry professionals and world leaders in computational materials science. The goal of the conference is to advance technology, leading to collaborations in metallurgy, materials, manufacturing, and data science. The award supports student attendance to the CALPHAD conference to promote diversity and excellence in the field.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCALPHAD is a method used in modern materials science tools for over half a century. It's critical for developing innovative materials and processing techniques, which were listed in the \"National Strategy for Advanced Manufacturing\" released by the White House. As a tool of the Materials Genome, the method requires more improvement for advanced manufacturing and materials. The CALPHAD conference is a platform for scientists to communicate and collaborate in materials thermodynamics and its applications. This award facilitates the conference organizer\u2019s ability to support young researchers, especially women and minority students, in this field. By attending this conference, students and professionals are discussing the fundamental science behind developing advanced materials used in different applications. This activity is helping to develop new manufacturing techniques and improve technology, which is crucial for innovation and knowledge generation. Additionally, this conference provides a chance for students to interact with leaders in the field, helping to promote diversity and excellence in both academia and industry.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research (through the Metals and Metallic Nanostructures Program, the Ceramics Program, the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program and the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory Program) as well as the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation (through the Advanced Manufacturing Program and the Mechanics of Materials and Structures Program).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
