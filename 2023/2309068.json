The conference will feature 8 plenary lectures by leading researchers in the field as well as contributed talks.\r\n\r\nThis is a biennial meeting, initiated in 1983 by the Faculty of Mathematics, Adam Mickiewicz University, in Poznan, Poland.  The aims of these conferences are to present recent research results and to identify and explore directions for further research in random discrete structures, randomized algorithms, and broad areas of application of probabilistic methods in discrete mathematics, computer science, and related fields. For more information see the conference web page: https://rsa.math.cmu.edu/RSA2023/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
