 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research investigates the role and emergence of medium-scale farms (3-50 hectares in size) in agricultural transformation. In particular this project examines the emergence and influence of investor farmers. Investor farmers are actors that do not reside on-farm and for whom farming is a financial investment rather than an occupation or mode of subsistence. This disconnect between farm and residence may result in different farm management strategies compared to farms where the owner resides on-farm. Using a combination of interviews and archival research this research project investigates how and whether investor farmers are influencing the development of commercial agriculture in places where more traditional farming systems persist. The project advances the understanding of changing rural-urban relationships, the role of investor farmers in shaping farming systems, and the development of rural areas. \r\n\r\nThe project investigates how urban-based, medium-scale investor farmers are influencing processes of agrarian change. The amount of land occupied by medium-scale farms has been increasing in many regions of the world, a process that is commonly driven by urban residents seeking financial returns through agricultural investments that they manage from afar. While investor farmers are often recognized as drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship, their actual role in transforming farming systems and advancing agricultural commercialization is unclear. A mixed methods approach is applied including semi-structured interviews with investor farmers, farm managers, landowners and government officials. Oral life histories of investor farmers are employed to understand the pathways by which investor farmers become central actors in land acquisition and agricultural transformation. Archival research of NGO reports, government reports and newspaper articles is used to identify how the process of agricultural transformations are represented by different actors and in varying outlets. All data are coded for semantic analysis using NVIVO. Given global population growth trends and the continued reliance on agriculture as a vehicle of economic development, the increasing control of rural agricultural land by investor farmers has significant implications for the future of agricultural production. This research project contributes to an understanding of the role of medium-scale farm investors and their contribution to food security, rural-urban inequalities, and economic development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project was motivated by research which showed that the number of medium scale farms and the share of agricultural land that they occupy in various African countries has been increasing steadily over the past two decades. This increase is often driven by urban residents acquiring rural land and engaging in agricultural activities to earn financial returns. These investor farmers are able to farm from afar by coordinating rural agricultural activities from the cities where they reside. They do so by using varied bundles of movements, relations and networks that tie the rural and the urban. The increasing control of rural agricultural land and production by urban residents has implications for rural-urban inequalities as well as food and agricultural futures in Kenya where this project was undertaken, and in other African countries where similar processes are underway. The project investigated how and whether these investor farmers engaged in farming from afar are influencing processes of agrarian change, i.e., the development and entrenchment of commercial agriculture in rural areas where non-commercial forms of farming continue to persist. In doing so, the project sought to understand the role of various forms of movements, relations and networks that span rural and urban areas, in shaping processes of agrarian change.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The funding provided by this grant enabled the Co-PI to undertake fieldwork in the three study sites described in the proposal, i.e., the Kenyan counties of Nairobi, Nakuru and Narok. Nairobi is Kenya&rsquo;s administrative and commercial center where many of the investor farmers have their primary residence, while Narok and Nakuru are both locations where investor farmers are active. The Co-PI conducted interviews with investor farmers and their farm managers, county government agricultural officials, as well as academic experts on agrarian change in Kenya. With the permission of the investor farmers, the Co-PI visited the rural areas where they were farming to engage in direct observations on their farms. The Co-PI recorded the interviews and observations on audio-recorder and notebook. He took relevant photographs at the farms when consent was granted. The Co-PI also undertook archival research at the Kenya National Archives in Nairobi, Kenya. He started coding and analysis of the data during the data collection period and continues to do so. The Co-PI is currently writing up the results from this analysis in a three-article doctoral dissertation which he expects to complete in 2024, with the guidance of the PI.</p>\n<p>Preliminary outcomes from this research include the findings that investor farmers employ various bundles of movements, relations and networks to obtain access to rural agricultural land, engage in agricultural production and to manage relations with the people in the rural areas where they are farming. These dynamic bundles of mobilities are fundamental to the agricultural operations of the investor farmers. While investor farmers seek to distinguish themselves as modern and entrepreneurial in contrast to the more traditional type of farmers found in those rural areas where they are active, in reality the two types of farmers (&lsquo;modern&rsquo; and &lsquo;traditional&rsquo;) are tied in interdependent relations that support each other. The research also showed that while processes of deagrarianization are underway as rural people shift from agricultural-based livelihoods, simultaneous processes of reagrarianization are also unfolding as urban residents invest incomes earned from off-farm employment into rural agriculture in their quest for economic security. Domestic capital flows are therefore integral to shaping modes of agricultural production in Kenya&rsquo;s rural areas. This finding also points to the continued relevance of the agrarian question which refers to how capitalist relations and production become entrenched in rural areas and the agricultural sector.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The PI and Co-PI are developing these findings further with the aim of publishing them in various academic journals. The Co-PI will also share the findings from this research project with the academic experts he engaged with from Tegemeo Institute, Kenya&rsquo;s leading agricultural research institution that contributes to shaping agricultural policy in the country. The project also served as a vital training experience for the co-Pi who intends to return to Kenya where he will work as an educator, scholar, and policy advisor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/15/2024<br>\nModified by: Mwangi&nbsp;Chege</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2233591/2233591_10847417_1710340615557_zero_grazing_stall--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2233591/2233591_10847417_1710340615557_zero_grazing_stall--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Zero grazing stall\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2233591/2233591_10847417_1710340615557_zero_grazing_stall--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Zero grazing stall\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The investor farmer built these stalls to minimize the movements the dairy cows make so that more of their energy is directed towards milk production.
