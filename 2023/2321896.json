 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF Conference Award: PI \u2013 Dr. Sharlene Newman, University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Title: Advancing research and education in big data neuroscience\r\n\r\nIn recent years, there has been a massive increase in the number of publicly available neuroimaging datasets and online tools for their analysis. These developments have led to vastly productive research that makes use of existing data rather than incurring the cost of continuously creating new datasets. Online data sharing and analysis have also proved to be extremely beneficial to the transparency and accessibility of neuroscience to other communities (e.g., computational modelling, engineering). However, the benefits have not spread evenly, and remain concentrated in well-resourced labs and institutions. \r\n\r\nThis workshop seeks to change that, by specifically engaging with less well-funding institutions across the South, particularly HBCUs, to provide training in the use of these tools, foster collaborations, and solicit insights from researchers at these institutions for how to further lower barriers to their participation. Participants will be provided with funding for travel to attend and participate in a multiday workshop consisting of talks, listening sessions, and direct training. Speakers and presenters include faculty from universities across the south and several HBCUs. The workshop aims to foster the development of a community of neuroimaging researchers across the South.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by Cognitive Neuroscience and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The workshop continued the success of the previous year&rsquo;s workshops that were seed-funded via the NSF Big Data program. The first meeting in the south was at the University of Texas in Austin hosted by Dr. Franco Pestilli in September 2022.</p>\n<p>These following goals were achieved by the 2023 workshop:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Collaboration: </strong>Expand ACCN in the southern states and connect established and upcoming neuroscience research and training centers.<strong> </strong>Researchers and students from across the south were in attendance. They learned from each other and shared their ongoing research as well as discussed future collaborations. For example, Dr. Chris Rorden from the University of South Carolina&rsquo;s group was in attendance and was able to provide valuable support to a junior research scientist who is beginning her development of a cohort of stroke patients in rural Alabama. &nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Training</strong>: We hosted a 2-day intensive workshop targeting advanced undergraduate and graduate students focused on the use of brainlife.io to perform basic data management, MRI data preprocessing, and morphological analysis of structural data. The brainlife.io team conducted the hands-on workshop.</li>\n<li><strong>Increase Diversity</strong>: We invited faculty and students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other minority-serving institutions as well as limited resource institutions to the 2023 meeting. We engaged in outreach to several universities and had students from Alabama State University, Alabama A&amp;M University, Tuskegee University and Stillman College register for the meeting, demonstrating the interest. We also had a faculty member from Alabama State University participate in the program, Dr. D. Lisa Cothran. Her involvement has led to a training grant application with The University of Alabama designed to train students in cognitive neuroscience research. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Program Committee and Program</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sharlene Newman,</strong> Professor of Psychology, Executive Director, Alabama Life Research Institute, University of Alabama&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Franco Pestilli,</strong> Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Texas, Austin</li>\n<li><strong>Josiah Leong, </strong>Assistant Professor of Psychological Science, University of Arkansas </li>\n<li><strong>Kristina Visscher, </strong>Associate Professor, UAB Department of&nbsp;Neurobiology, Co-Director, Civitan International Neuroimaging Laboratory</li>\n<li><strong>Firat Soylu, </strong>Associate Professor, College of Education, University of Alabama</li>\n<li><strong>Jennifer Robinson, </strong>Associate Professor, Auburn University  \n<ul>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The program is included in the appendix.</p>\n<p><strong>Recruitment and Participation</strong></p>\n<p>We advertised the workshop at colleges and universities across the southeast.
