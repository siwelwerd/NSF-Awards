 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports student attendance at the 2023 IEEE Cyber Security Development (SecDev) conference to be held in Atlanta in October 2023. Research on software security usually focuses on detecting vulnerabilities in software and attacks on resources. However, there is little attention to how programmers can develop secure software from the ground up. This conference series on Secure Development (SecDev) focuses on this important area. The 2023 IEEE SecDev Conference aims to continue its mission of providing a forum where researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers can meet to discuss ideas that focus on building-in security into our systems. The support for the conference is important for educating and training the workforce in this area and helping provide a pathway to research careers. The technical advances presented by the conference are critical to the development of secure software, which is important to society.\r\n\r\nSecDev encourages students to consider big ideas that lead to a stimulating, thoughtful, and perhaps (gently) provocative discussion. This project sponsors travel expenses for students to attend the conference. Participation in the conference provides students with opportunities to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field, consequently exerting a positive impact on the quality of their research. The training and development of students in this way also help widen the talent pool of professionals and researchers focused on addressing the challenges of developing critical secure systems and services, leading to potential new areas of inquiry in this domain. This project also broadens the participation in the conference of underrepresented students in computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a technical conference focused on a key science and technology area. Students gained the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field both in the main conference, tutorial sessions, and poster sessions. We consider the conference and the grant to be a success.&nbsp;Positive experiences as students in conferences such as SecDev promote valuable future professional contributions and leadership in venues such as this one.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/08/2024<br>\nModified by: Weihang&nbsp;Wang</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",

SecDev also hosts poster sessions focused on student contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2023 SecDev student travel grant was open to PhD, Masters, and undergraduate students. The conference organizing committee requested a letter from a research advisor of the applicant to give priority to students who have been involved in research projects with an advisor.For 2023, the conference made substantial efforts to recruit minority candidates, specifically from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and candidates from scholarship for service (SFS) schools.To protect against conflicts of interest, the selection committee ensured that they were not selecting their own students.\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect recruitment attempts were performed at the following universities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity\n\n\n\n\nHBCU\n\n\n\n\nSFS\n\n\n\n\nApplicants\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuburn University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoston University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBowie State University\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClemson University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoppin University\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHampton University\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoward University\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLincoln University of Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLouisiana State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarymount University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorgan State University\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Mexico State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina A&T State University\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthwestern University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOklahoma State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRowan University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState University of New York at Binghamton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyracuse University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas A&M University-Corpus Christi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe College of William and Marry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTowson University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Alabama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Arizona\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity at Buffalo, SUNY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Alabama Birmingham\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Alaska Anchorage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Arkansas Fayetteville\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Connecticut\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Delaware\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Florida\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Hawaii at Hilo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Hawaii at Manoa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Idaho\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Kansas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Kentucky\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Louisiana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Maine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Maryland\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts, Amherst\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Mississippi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Missouri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Montana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Nebraska\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Nevada\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of New Hampshire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of New Mexico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Rhode Island\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of South Carolina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Southern California\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of the District of Columbia\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Vermont\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Virginia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia Tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia State University\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Virginia State University\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe received 25 applications for the 2023 conference and awarded 15 students for the travel grant. By the numbers for the 2023 NSF Student Travel Grants:\n\n25 submitted applications\n15 students awarded\n14 completed registrations\n9 self-identified as minority (4 female students and 5 from under-represented groups)\nUp to $1200 in reimbursements per student\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe the NSF travel grant enabled underrepresented students to attend the conference bringing a diversity of thought to the conference that would not have been possible without this travel grant. This project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a technical conference focused on a key science and technology area. Students gained the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field both in the main conference, tutorial sessions, and poster sessions. We consider the conference and the grant to be a success.Positive experiences as students in conferences such as SecDev promote valuable future professional contributions and leadership in venues such as this one.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/08/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: WeihangWang\n"
