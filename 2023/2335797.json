 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 10th ACM conference on Information-Centric Networking (ICN 2023) takes place in Reykjavik, Iceland from October 8 to October 10, 2023. For more than a decade, ACM ICN has been the primary venue for the community to publish their research endeavors in Information-Centric Networking. This award provides funding to help 8-10 US-based graduate students attend the ICN conference. Participation in conferences such as ICN forms a central part of the graduate school experience as it provides students with an opportunity to present their ongoing research and receive early feedback and interact with senior researchers from academia and industry, which exposes them to cutting edge research in the field. This year, the ACM ICN conference will be held in the same location and adjacent in time with the 31st IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP 2023) \u2014 October 10 to October 13 in Reykjavik, Iceland. This concurrent arrangement provides a valuable opportunity for the exchange and enrichment of ICN ideas and advancements within the larger networking community. To foster collaboration, the conference organizers are planning special events designed to attract attendees to both conferences. The support requested in this proposal will enable students to attend the main conference and potentially the ICNP 2023.\r\n\r\nParticipating students will have invaluable opportunities to receive constructive feedback on their research projects, witness high-quality presentations, and engage with senior researchers in the community. Student participation is expected to have a positive impact on the quality of their research, while also enabling them to gain insights into emerging research advancements with potential implications for the broader fields of networking and security. Moreover, this experience will facilitate the expansion of their breadth of knowledge, ideas, and research skills.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
