 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Georgia Southern University (GSU), located in Statesboro, Georgia, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2023-2025. Housed at GSU's Department of Biology, the unifying theme involves the impacts of global climate change stressors on organisms and ecosystems of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The goal is to engage undergraduates in research and professional development activities that promote an understanding of the unique biological resources occurring in this geographic region as well as their sustainable use and management. Students will participate in hands-on research guided by faculty mentors, as well as in professional development workshops targeting general and conceptual knowledge in the ecology of the coastal plain, scientific communication skills (oral and written), techniques for locating and evaluating primary literature, and ethical practices in science. Student recruitment is targeted at 1st and 2nd year (freshman and sophomore) students attending institutions where research opportunities may be more limited, such as at 2-year colleges and primarily undergraduate institutions. Students will be required to register in the NSF ETAP system (etap.nsf.gov) and tracked after the program to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nStudents will conduct research on how stressors impact organisms and ecosystems of the Atlantic Coastal Plain while learning field and laboratory skills that are broadly relevant to ecosystem-level scientific investigations. Many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. The goal is to foster an environment for learning and professional development that leads to opportunities in graduate studies and careers in science. Assessment of the program will be done through the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting https://sites.google.com/georgiasouthern.edu/icps-reu/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. J. Checo Colon-Gaud at jccolongaud@georgiasouthern.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
