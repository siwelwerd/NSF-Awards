 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fields of bioinformatics, genomics, systems biology, and intelligent computing have been under rapid growth during the past two decades, thanks to the advances in biotechnologies and computing power. Research in these fields requires interdisciplinary training and collaboration, which is challenging for both students and junior investigators. The International Conference on Intelligent Biology and Medicine (ICIBM) was developed in 2012, with its goal to promote information science, technology, and education to a great variety of trainees and young investigators, including trainees, faculty, teachers, scientists, and engineers, and to provide a forum for the cross-fertilization of ideas and collaboration in these areas. This award provides funding for 20 students and four keynote speakers to attend the International Conference on Intelligent Biology and Medicine (CBM) to be held in July 2022 in Tampa, FL. The trainees will participate in several activites including: i) tutorials and workshops, ii) poster session, iii) a 2 hour session with keynote speakers, iii) networking dinner with keynote speakers and the organizers. The successful completion of ICIBM 2023 will help these trainees and junior investigators learn cutting-edge technologies from distinguished speakers and tutorials and workshops, share their exciting research works, build collaborations, gain advice from other peers, and build better careers in the rapidly evolving data science and artificial intelligence fields. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide support to develop and provide a series of interdisciplinary, educational and scientific events in ICIBM 2023, with a specific focus on data science and artificial intelligence. The conference program will include eight distinguished lectures from four keynote speakers and four eminent scholars, four tutorials and workshops, a technology innovation session, a poster presentation session, and an Artificial Intelligence on Big Data: Promise for Early-stage Trainees session. As before, the conference will provide abundant collaborative and interactive opportunities, and encourage educational and interactive initiatives for both junior and established researchers. ICIBM will develop program and events to support the career development of talented trainees and young scientists, including underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities. The financial support will cover the expenses for 4 keynote speakers, as well as allow the organizers to support 20 trainees to actively participate in all scientific and technical sessions at ICIBM 2023 through travel grants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The fund was used to partially support these conferences including 20 travel awardees and four invited speakers. ICIBM 2023 attracted 208 registrants plus 10 volunteers. The number of participants in ICIBM 2023 is more than that of any ICIBM conference before the COVID-19 pandemic. Its scientific program is comprehensive and highly interactive. It had four tutorials and workshops, four keynote lectures, four eminent scholars&rsquo; presentations, 11 concurrent scientific sessions, and a poster session. There were 88 scientific oral presentations and 46 poster presentations. Put all presentations together, it had total 164 presentations (88 oral presentations + 8 keynote/eminent scholars&rsquo; presentation + 46 poster presentations + 22 speakers in tutorials/workshops = total 164 presentations). We are in the process of publishing four special issues. The program added two Flash Talk sessions and a session &ldquo;Artificial Intelligence on Big Data: Promise for Early-stage Trainees&rdquo;, which offered unique opportunities for young or early-stage trainees including college and high school students to engage ICIBM and interact with senior investigators. This NSF grant supported 20 travel awards in ICIBM 2023 to trainees from diverse backgrounds. Review and selection of these awardees was handled by the Award Committee. The criteria of selection were based on the quality of the research (paper or abstract, first author), the financial need, diversity/minority of the attendees, geographic locations, among others. These trainees and participants included those from NSF-funded REU program at UTSA (minority trainees), as well as several high school students. These travel awards encouraged the participation of young scientists in training from a diverse array of both scientific and societal backgrounds. All the travel awardees were able to attend the conference and presented their work. An award ceremony was given during the ICIBM 2023 conference. The selected pee-reviewed papers were invited to resubmit to six special issues in journals: Patterns, Cancers, Genes, Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal, Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity, and Quantitative Biology, all of which are open access journals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/22/2024<br>\nModified by: Zhongming&nbsp;Zhao</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
