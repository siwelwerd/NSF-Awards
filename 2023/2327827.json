 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract: \r\nMagnets play an essential role in modern technologies such as information storage, energy harvesting, high-speed transportation, water purification, and biomedicine. Commercial devices typically utilize three-dimensional magnets, in the form of bulk crystals or nanostructures, to realize the desired applications. This project focuses on atomically thin layers of two-dimensional magnetic materials, which have remarkable advantages over conventional three-dimensional magnets because of their exotic low-dimensional properties and high sensitivity to external stimuli. The goal of the project is to understand and manipulate the magnetic properties of a novel class of two-dimensional magnets through a highly integrated collaborative effort of two principal investigators with complementary expertise. The fundamental understanding and dynamic control of two-dimensional magnetism is anticipated to pave the way towards the realization of novel ultra-compact devices for modern information technology and beyond. Through the research project, the principal investigators will further their ongoing effort of training students, especially underrepresented minorities, to enhance diversity in STEM research. Meanwhile, interactive outreach activities are planned to promote STEM education in disadvantaged rural or suburban schools and to attract high school students to quantum materials research.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: \r\nTwo-dimensional magnets offer a unique platform for both the fundamental study of exotic magnetism and the innovation of ultra-compact devices for advanced technologies. The overarching goal of this collaborative research project is to accurately map the magnetic phase diagram and manipulate spin dynamics in a family of self-intercalated van der Waals magnets, chromium tellurides. The experimental activities include: 1) establish precisely controlled intercalation-magnetism relations and create a phase diagram; 2) tuning and determining the relative influence of charge carriers, magnetic moments of intercalants, and atomic lattice spacing on the magnetic properties; 3) probing and manipulating the magnetization and coherent spin dynamics with ultrafast demagnetization, ferromagnetic resonance, and terahertz phonon excitation. The project will create systematic and comprehensive knowledge about magnetism and spin dynamics in this intriguing family of two-dimensional magnets. As such, the research project will offer a new scientific paradigm to understand and engineer two-dimensional intercalated magnetic materials. Correlated with the research components are interactive outreach programs that aim to foster STEM education in disadvantaged rural or suburban schools and inspire high school students by connecting them to quantum research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
