 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by supporting professional development for mathematics and statistics faculty to increase equity within mathematics and statistics education. Evidence-based practices show that a commitment to culturally relevant and responsive curriculum and pedagogy designed for the diversity of today\u2019s learners is one way to advance such equity. Through this project post-secondary mathematics and statistics faculty will convene for an intensive three-day seminar that will equip participants with skills and expertise to meaningfully incorporate social justice themes such as electoral issues and environmental justice, into their curricula and teaching practices. Post-seminar activities include sessions or workshops at two regional conferences hosted by the North Central Section of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA-NCS), and virtual engagement of faculty from the section to provide ongoing collaboration and peer-to-peer support as faculty make changes to their teaching. By engaging faculty across diverse institutions, this seminar will serve as a regional model for sustained professional development aimed at advancing equity in STEM fields.\r\n \r\nThe Mathematics and Data for Social Justice Summer Seminar will support two and four-year post-secondary mathematics and statistics educators in their efforts to transform their teaching to be culturally relevant and responsive through social justice curricula and pedagogies. The seminar derives from the need to address inequities and reduce persistent gaps in STEM access, engagement, and persistence. Four expected outcomes for the participants guide the work of the seminar. First is to increase their ability to incorporate equity and social justice issues into their teaching practice. Second is to engage and collaborate in a community of practice focused on equity and social justice in mathematics. Third is to develop capacity to facilitate discussions of equity and social justice in the classroom. Fourth is to adapt or generate new curricula in mathematics and social justice. Following the seminar participants will engage in a community of practice that will encourage further development and dissemination of any developed classroom materials and to provide immediate and responsive collaborative support to each other. The community of practice will engage in person at semi-annual conferences of the MAA-NCS, and connect in virtual collaboration and conversations throughout the year following the seminar. Participants will be invited to focus group discussions, which will thereby inform the structures and practices of the MAA-NCS governing board. Developed resources will be shared through professional meetings and online discussion platforms of the MAA. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
