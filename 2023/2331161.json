 "awd_abstract_narration": "This activity is for proposed travel awards for 20+ U.S.-based graduate and under-graduate students to participate in the 31st ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS 2023 Conference, which will be held in Hamburg, Germany, November 13 \u2013 November 16, 2023. The Conference is annually organized by the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Special Interest Group on Spatial Information (SIGSPATIAL), which is an association for researchers, students, and professionals interested in research, development, and deployment of solutions to spatial information handling and spatial knowledge extraction problems. The Conference started in 1993, has established itself as the world\u2019s premier research conference in spatial data and GIS; it provides a forum for original research contributions covering all conceptual, design, and implementation aspects of GIS ranging from applications, user interfaces, and visualization to storage management and indexing issues. Besides the technical program, the Conference features workshops, a student research competition, a data competition, and demos. The importance of spatial information handling continuously increases with new application domains and the availability and ubiquity of large spatial data such as maps, remote-sensing images, 3D medical atlases, and the decennial census. Businesses, industry, academia, and governmental agencies utilize spatial information to improve their daily operations, structure new strategies, and increase overall productivity and US competitiveness.\r\n\r\nSpatial data and applications pose novel research challenges in a wide variety of sub-areas, includ-ing (but not limited to) spatial information acquisition, modeling, data structures, and algorithms,analysis, querying and integration, human-computer interaction and visualization, and systems\r\nand architectures. From these sub-areas, deep research questions emerge that are motivated by a broad range of applications (e.g., emergency and crisis management, environmental monitoring, global positioning and location detection, geosciences, location-based and mobile services, \r\nnavigation, and route planning). ACM SIGPATIAL GIS has provided a forum for this research, including presentations of accepted technical papers, poster and demo exhibition encouraging lively interaction among all participants, and presentations by leading related industry members. The participation of U.S. graduate and promising undergraduate students will result in the intellectual stimulation of young minds to pursue advanced research and development activities inan area that has a huge technical and societal impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The SIGSPATIAL Cup was offered for the 12th time in 2023 and was, as usual, very popular with students. The ACM Student Research Competition was held for the 12th time, which allowed undergraduate and graduate students to share their research results and exchange ideas with other students, judges, and conference attendees, understand the practical applications of their research, perfect their communication skills, and receive prizes and gain recognition from ACM and the greater computing community. The undergraduate ACM Student Research winner, whose travel was partly supported under this NSF award, at SIGSPATIAL went for the national ACM Student Research Competition and won Third Place. ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS 2023 also hosted its second female networking event with 30 plus female researchers. Most of the attendees at the networking event were current Ph.D. students in spatial science or computer science. The discussions among the event attendees revolved around various topics, including building a career, managing time as a mother and Ph.D. student, and effectively navigating challenging situations as minorities. All attendees widely enjoyed and appreciated the event.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/22/2024<br>\nModified by: Yao-Yi&nbsp;Chiang</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
