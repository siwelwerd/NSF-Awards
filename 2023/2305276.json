 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Fettrow\u2019s project entitled \u201cSoil Carbon Biogeochemistry Under a Changing Climate: Current and Future Alterations from Forest Fires\u201d investigates the impacts forest fires have on the forest carbon cycle. Forests protect against rapid climate change and global warming because trees remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. Some of this carbon is stored belowground in soil from root growth, carbon that \u201cleaks\u201d out of the roots and from leaf litter. Over time, carbon in forest soils has built up to be one of the largest active reservoirs of stored carbon, but climate change has put this carbon reservoir at risk. During a forest fire, which are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, some of the carbon in the soil is released back to the atmosphere as the forest burns. In addition, the biology and chemistry of soil changes after a forest fire, changing how forests function. The significance of this project is that it will allow for a better understanding of how the forest carbon cycle is changed by forest fires, particularly as forest fires become more common with climate change. These findings will advance Earth science and may lead to improved forest management and climate policy. In addition, part of Dr. Fettrow\u2019s professional development plan is to help motivate and train the next generation of scientists by mentoring undergraduate and graduate students in the field and lab, particularly students from underrepresented communities and first-gen students. \r\n\r\nThe main goals of the project are to (1) determine how forest fires affect belowground soil carbon and biogeochemistry (i.e., biological, and geochemical reactions affecting soil carbon cycling), (2) resolve uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of soil carbon loss during a forest fire (3) and investigate how forest fire affected soils and their carbon storage capacity is altered. These goals will be accomplished by conducting integrated laboratory and field experiments across multiple temporal and spatial scales, using basic soil, gas and water biogeochemical analyses paired with state-of-the-art facilities such as the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. These experimental activities and research findings will benefit both science and society. First, the results will help improve Earth System Models (ESMs) that predict global carbon feedback loops and cycles, particularly under a changing climate. This information will also improve fundamental understanding of soil biogeochemistry with global change. Second, findings will be useful for land managers and policy makers developing natural climate solution programs and improving climate mitigation policy aimed at protecting and restoring our valuable forests.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
