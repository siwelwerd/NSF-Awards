 "awd_abstract_narration": "This postdoctoral fellowship research project plans to explore student usage of AI-based technological tools, such as ChatGPT, in the context of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning and investigate students\u2019 identity development while advancing their scientific communication skills, a necessary competency for all STEM professional pathways. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, is sparking disruptions in how students are learning in college spaces and developing skills to compete in a global economy.  In particular, the underrepresentation of minoritized groups in STEM is an ongoing challenge and will likely be impacted by the use of AI. These challenges inspire the investigation and awareness of systemic inequities amid the development of new teaching and learning approaches. Notably, the current literature in STEM education does not extend to students\u2019 use of AI or AI\u2019s role in identity development. To improve STEM education and reduce STEM disparities, this project will examine the use of artificial intelligence within STEM learning and its impact on students\u2019 identity development. Moreover, it is vital that the experiences of students from underrepresented groups are taken into account while new AI technology is developed and used in STEM educational and professional contexts. Accordingly, an important milestone in addressing STEM disparities and broadening participation is to develop an evidence base for equitable instructional approaches for the use of these tools in STEM teaching and learning. To this end, this project will investigate and provide evidence to inform guidelines on the use of AI learning tools, such as ChatGPT, in science curricula with a focus on promoting STEM identity development and equitable student learning with AI. \r\n\r\nTwo quantitative-qualitative experiments will be conducted to determine how experiences in science communication impact students\u2019 competencies, confidence, and identity development in a communication-intensive STEM course and how students are using AI tools in scientific communication, and those tools' impact on students' science identity development. The quantitative experiments will assess students\u2019 perceived science identity as STEM professionals and science communicators as well as students\u2019 perceived science communication training. The qualitative experiments will assess students\u2019 experiences with confidence, competency, and identity development through the process of the writing format, use of AI, and scientific writing and science communication. Providing more detailed information on how students use AI and its effects on identity development within STEM will support positive and lasting changes in STEM courses and offer insight into equitable instructional features that specifically support minoritized students in STEM, their science identity development, and their access to evolving technology. \r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) program that aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied research that advances knowledge within the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
