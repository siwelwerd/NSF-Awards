 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support an in-person workshop and mentoring activities in support of capacity-building efforts by NSF to enable the participation of minority-serving institutions, community colleges, and two-year and four-year institutions to participate in regional innovation ecosystems.  To support institutions in building collaborations, identifying resources, and preparing competitive grant applications, the activities under this project will connect Emerging Research Institutions (ERIs) with experts in research development and broader impacts work.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project will leverage resources from the Center for Advancing Research Impact in Society (ARIS), Spelman College, and the National Organization of Research Development Professionals (NORDP) to support ERIs as they work through the submission of research capacity-building proposals by establishing relationships among and between ERIs and experts in research development and broader impacts.  The activities will focus on the workshop participants' ability to create partnerships with external organizations to grow in workforce development, research and development, and translation of research to practice.  The proposed partnerships represent a unique opportunity for researchers and administrators at ERIs to join with one another and benefit from the guidance of experts to develop and submit strong collaborative research proposals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
