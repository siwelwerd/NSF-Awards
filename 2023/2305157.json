 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced manufacturing has a potential to contribute toward industrial decarbonization through replacing or improving manufacturing processes of low energy efficiency or high emissions using innovative technologies and utilizing novel manufacturing methods to make products that improve energy efficiency or reduce emissions. To unleash the full potential of advanced manufacturing for industrial decarbonization, convergent research is required among experts in advanced manufacturing, industrial electrification, low-carbon fuels and energy sources, as well as carbon capture, utilization and storage, and equally important, techno-economics, etc. This award supports a workshop on advanced manufacturing for industrial decarbonization to be held in the Washington DC area during summer 2023. The workshop will enable extensive domain experts to discuss together and identify economically viable technologies for industrial decarbonization enabled by advanced manufacturing. Results from the workshop will be instrumental in setting coordinated priorities and strategies on fundamental research that potentially leads to cost-effective industrial applications. Speakers and participants with a diverse background will be targeted, including those from underrepresented groups and representing a wide range of institutions (e.g., minority serving, EPSCoR jurisdiction, and Non-R1 institutions).\r\n\r\nThis workshop aims at: (i) identifying gaps and challenges in advanced manufacturing for industrial decarbonization, including thorough techno-economic assessments, (ii) sharing perspectives from federal agencies, and (iii) formulating recommendations for research initiatives on economically viable decarbonization technologies. The objectives will be achieved through a set of activities. Experts from industry, national laboratories, and academia will present inspiring examples of advanced manufacturing for industrial decarbonization and their techno-economic assessment. Individuals from federal agencies will talk about their agencies\u2019 perspectives. Panel discussions will provide a deep dive into different topics on advanced manufacturing for industrial decarbonization. In addition, idea presentations will be given by other participants regarding emerging technologies in the field. A steering committee will be formed, consisting of representatives with diverse professional, technical and demographic backgrounds. The committee will work with the project team on both the workshop technical content and broadening participations, such as identifying and inviting speakers and strategizing participant recruitments. The workshop outcomes will be summarized in a report with wide disseminations. The findings are expected to improve coordination on the research initiatives on advanced manufacturing for industrial decarbonization and, therefore, promote the progress of science in the intersection between manufacturing and decarbonization, increase the competitiveness of the U.S. industry and better the sustainability of the planet.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
