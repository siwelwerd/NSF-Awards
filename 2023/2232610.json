 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop technology for the next generation of high-temperature superconducting wire production that will increase the throughput and quality of power transmission through the wire.  Lowering wire costs is an integral part in the commercialization of cables that carry 5-10x more power than traditional copper cables and can meet increasing electricity demands using existing rights-of-way. High-temperature superconducting technology also enables magnetic-confinement fusion which has the potential to provide abundant clean energy.  \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to perform research, development, and testing for the mass production of high-temperature superconducting wire at high current capacity and low cost. The goal is to understand the technologies, validate performance at a process level, and then transfer the validated technology into reliable high performing designs that will be integrated into the system design. The research focuses on technologies that increase the conversion efficiency of the precursor material into high-temperature superconducting film deposited on a textured micron-thin metal base tape. The work focuses on the following technologies: design of solid precursor feeds for solid to vapor flow generation and higher growth rate films; development of photo-activation and ultraviolet-enhanced technologies; enhancement of tape temperature uniformity for high current capacity via susceptor material selection and radiation properties.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
