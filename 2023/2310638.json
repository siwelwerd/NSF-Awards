 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project seeks to develop and make available simulated and synthetic data on four distinct but highly interdependent critical infrastructures (ICIs) in the United States: the electric power grid, the natural gas supply chain, the oil supply chain, and the coal supply chain.  When viewed together as a single system, these four infrastructures define the American Multi-Modal Energy System (AMES). All data and software from this project will be made freely and publicly available in order to facilitate academic, industry, and government research on the AMES, as well as reuse and refinement of software code. Methods developed through this research will be integrated into the Dartmouth engineering systems curriculum at the undergraduate and graduate levels and communicated more broadly online through the Irving Institute for Energy & Society and the edX platform.    \r\n\r\nThe development of simulated and synthetic data on mechanistic and human aspects of AMES will fundamentally improve understanding of the structure and behavior of these systems.  This objective will be achieved by addressing how can raw data be algorithmically converted into a simulated dataset of the AMES, and by enriching the simulated dataset through advanced mathematical modeling of AMES system behavior. This work will lead to a structural hetero-functional graph model of the AMES, as well as to a dynamic, spatially-distributed simulation that corresponds to the best available data on the AMES.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe AMES-3D (Synthetic and Simulated Data for American Multi-Modal Energy Systems) project has produced a single integrated system model of all American energy assets in the 48 contiguous states including the highly interdependent coal, oil, natural gas, and electric power systems as critical infrastructures. It connects these energy assets with two-way interdependencies that include physical matter-energy flows as well as price quantity exchanges. The AMES-3D project successfully delivered on its two promised research outputs: 1.) a structural model of the AMES using hetero-functional graph theory. 2.) a dynamic spatially-distributed simulation that corresponds to the best available data of the AMES. \n\nTo show the scientific value of our structural model, we conducted a resilience analysis of the entire American electric power system using heterofunctional graph theory and compared it to the previously reported results in the literature. Our analysis showed that those structural enhancement that improve grid sustainability also improve grid resilience. \n\nWe also conducted a network analysis on the AMES structural model as a whole. Both the model and the analysis are the first ever reported in the literature. We found that incumbent energy conversion technologies are systematically favored over more novel sustainable energy conversion technologies within the evolution of the AMES structure. \n\nFor our dynamic spatially distributed simulation, we produced the first ever weight-lease square hetero-functional graph state estimator of the entire American Multi-Modal Energy System. This state estimator reconciles the best available data on the AMES to give a month-by-month picture of how, where, and when all energy flows within the AMES. \n\nThe practical accomplishments mentioned above could not have been achieved without this projects investment into fundamental and basic research. This project made new advancements in tensor-based formulations of hetero-functional graph theory. Without these theoretical advancements, this project could not have completed in a timely fashion the complex computations required by the practical applications. \n\nThe project also produced an openly available hetero-functional graph theory toolbox that served as a computational technology at the core of all of the projects analyses. The above mentioned tensor-based formulations led to computational improvements of approximately 500x. A simulation that would have taken a year to complete could be done in less than a day.\n\nFinally, we produced a model-based systems engineering reference architecture for the AMES and its existing energy assets based upon best available data. This reference architecture provide a graphical blue print of energy flows in todays American multi-modal energy system. \n\nThis project has produced 1 book, 22 presentations, 3 conference paper, 6 journal paper, 2 undergraduate dissertation, and 1 doctoral dissertation. All of these are available to the public. This project has provided teaching or educational experiences for 1 graduate student, 2 professors, 2 undergraduate theses, and 10 undergraduate interns. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/12/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AmroMFarid\n"
