 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a microscale computed axial lithography additive manufacturing process. Inorganic materials including glasses and ceramics have high temperature and chemical resistance, high stiffness and strength, and biological inertness.  Due to the brittleness of the raw material, manufacturing of complex geometries is challenging and, historically, has been dominated by subtractive machining operations including milling, grinding, and chemical etching.  However, as technological advances motivate the manufacture of customized application-specific devices with unique 3D morphologies, the conventional fabrication methods are inherently limited by material removal unit processes.  The proposed technology is designed for rapid production of 3D microstructures with relatively smooth surfaces.  This may be used in the manufacture of microfluidic devices (including micromixers) with high optical clarity, inertness, and suitability for challenging chemical environments. In addition, the proposed technology may achieve customized geometries with multiple fluidic channel depths in low-volume production. This level of customization is not easily achievable with conventional short-run fabrication methods such as wet chemical etching, or injection molding. For example, the technology may be used to enable the rapid and precise printing of customized dental crowns, where each crown must be unique and tailored to fit the shape of the patient\u2019s teeth.  The proposed technology also may be applied to producing mold inserts for injection molding processes. In the future, this technology may reduce manufacturing costs and enable the customization of high-precision parts for a wide range of industries including dental, medical, and semiconductor.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of an additive manufacturing technology called computed axial lithography (CAL).  The proposed technology is a volumetric, light-based, micro-scale photopolymerization method conceptually analogous to the inverse of computed tomography. Parts are printed by exposing a container of photoresponsive material to computed light patterns from many angles and the integrated light dose photopolymerizes a prescribed 3D geometry.  The process is currently capable of defining geometries with 50 \u00b5m positive feature size and 150 \u00b5m internal channel diameters in silica glass nanocomposite materials within a few seconds. After thermal post-processing, complex solid silica glass geometries with high optical transparency and nanometer-level surface roughness may be achieved. In addition, the process by be used for printing directly into organic photopolymer resins, and processes for other ceramic nanocomposites with specialized applications are under development.  The merits of this technique over industrially established layer-by-layer methods include its higher throughput, lower surface roughness, and elimination of wasteful solid print-supporting structures. The lower surface roughness makes the process potentially attractive for applications where aesthetic clarity is important, and for producing custom micro-optical components. Fracture testing results indicate that the lower roughness results in a tighter distribution of mechanical strength in micro-CAL-printed components than in layer-by-layer-printed parts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our patented Computed Axial Lithography (CAL) rapid 3D printing technology offers a wide range of benefits such as smooth surface due to the layerless and volumetric process, with microscale resolution, and clear part formation within one minute. In addition, CAL has a special capability called overprinting, where printing around an object can be achieved, hence enabling rapid multi material fabrication. We began the I-Corps journey with a hypothesis that CAL could be combined with composite materials to serve multiple markets including dental restoratives and microfluidic devices. After just one week in the program, we were encouraged to refine our hypothesis and focus on the strongest market fit, which we believed to be dental applications. To validate our hypothesis, the team got out of the building and attended various dental and additive manufacturing conventions. Using those as networking events, the team was able to spend a large amount of time conversing with more than 150 stakeholders from the ecosystem and listening to their pain points and needs as well as learning from their expertise about the physical requirements and end-users&rsquo; desires. Those conventions enabled the team members to immerse themselves in the dental community and walk in the shoes of their customers. This experience helped the team refine the customer archetype from prosthodontists to dental lab managers. Reaching the end of the program, the team concluded that further customer discovery activities are needed to refine our findings. In addition, more R&amp;D work has to be conducted to commercialize the technology in the dental industry. Specifically, we learned that we would need to increase the strength and durability, verify biocompatibility for use in the mouth, and tackle the challenge of slow thermal processing after printing. Furthermore, we learned that patients desire realistic color and feel, so thematerial must be designed to emulate these characteristics. The team submitted an NSF PFI proposal with an industry partner to further the R&amp;D work needed to reach an MVP.
