 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gentrification and Displacement: What Can We Do About It? is the first international conference on gentrification studies in over 20 years. The conference program advances understandings of how to predict gentrification and how to measure and mitigate displacement. It provides a rare opportunity for scholars to engage with activists and practitioners who face gentrification on the ground in their day-to-day work. Invited speakers, panelists, and session organizers represent a diversity of career stages, disciplines, methodological and theoretical orientations, and demographic groups. The conference charts a path forward for the next decade of gentrification scholarship and provides recommendations to decision-makers facing housing crises around the globe.\r\n\r\nGentrification and Displacement: What Can We Do About It? is a dynamic two-and-a-half-day event, that includes three keynote speakers, two plenary panel discussions, 18 topical sessions, mentorship opportunities, poster displays, a book display, a documentary film screening, and a morning of site visits/field trips to community-based organizations focused on gentrification. The program interrogates questions about how to identify, measure, and predict gentrification, and about how best to assess and mitigate the consequences of gentrification-induced displacement. Intellectual outputs include a white paper; a special journal issue; an edited volume published with a university press; and a community practices report on avoiding and mitigating gentrification. The conference shapes and advances the research of the individual scholars who attend, and takes the field in an inclusive, equitable direction that includes perspectives from across disciplines, career stages, methodological and theoretical traditions, and from around the globe.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This three-day conference provided a rare opportunity for scholars from around the world -&nbsp;and from a wide variety of disciplines, including geography, urban planning, sociology, media studies, literature, gender and sexualities studies, film, and a variety of other fields -&nbsp;to engage with practitioners and activists who face gentrification on the ground in their day-to-day work. Over 240 attendees, from 35 countries and 144 universities and organizations, discussed how gentrification-related inequities and development were linked to disproportionate and escalating burdens on marginalized communities worldwide, and what can be done about it. The conference focused on the causes and consequences of gentrification, and, equally, what can be done about it.</p>\n<p>Speakers, panelists, and session organizers represented a great diversity of career stages, methodological and theoretical orientations, country of origin, and demographic groups. The gathering provided opportunities for networking, mentorship, and the highlighting of student and early career research. Moreover, it provided ample opportunity for engagement across traditional disciplinary lines, as well as between academics and planners, activists, organizers, and city officials.</p>\n<p><span>Some significant outcomes from the conference include: i) a two-day virtual conference on the media-gentrification nexus held during summer 2024; ii) an edited book under contract, open access, with UCL Press titled&nbsp;<em>Fighting to Stay Put: Learning from the Global Struggle Against Gentrification and Displacement</em>;&nbsp;iii) a special issue of the international journal&nbsp;<em>CITY&nbsp;</em>featuring papers on the state of the art and future of gentrification research; iv) development of an anti-displacement tool for the City of Louisville, KY; and v) invitation to input to the City of Boston's new anti-displacement toolkit.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/21/2024<br>\nModified by: Loretta&nbsp;C&nbsp;Lees</p></div>\n<div
