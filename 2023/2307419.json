 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have known for over a half century that rather than evolving in isolation, galaxies interact with their neighbors and environment, with colliding and merging galaxies being the most obvious (and extreme) examples. But more subtle interactions also occur, which direct the co- evolution of galaxies and their satellites. This process remains poorly understood, and it is a challenge to reproduce in cosmological simulations. Similarly, the connections between a galaxy\u2019s large-scale environment and its properties are still not completely understood. To help bridge these local and large-scale problems, the team will leverage their success in modeling sub-halo dynamics as well as the flow of mass, energy, and metals between galaxies and the surrounding circum-galactic medium (CGM) to create simulations that will be used to explore the dominant physical processes at work and make predictions for satellites in a range of environments. This award will also provide mentoring and support for a bridge student in graduate school in addition to underrepresented students the NYC area. \r\n\r\nBy bridging two disparate subfields -- sub-halo dynamics and CGM/galaxy co-evolution -- this work will advance our understanding of how satellite populations are shaped by baryonic physics associated with their host, the large-scale environment, and galaxy assembly. Using a series of high-resolution simulations the team will explore parameter space with large volume mock light-cones to provide context and scalability for larger simulations and maximize the impact of upcoming surveys. The project will address questions regarding the observed variations among satellite populations of MW-analogs and connections between physical processes and known correlations between the galaxy properties and their large-scale environments. These results will also inform other aspects of satellite evolution, which are otherwise not possible without a more robust understanding of their baryonic evolution and host back-reactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
