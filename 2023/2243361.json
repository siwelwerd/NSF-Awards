 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to serve the national need of developing highly qualified science teacher leaders in elementary schools. The quality of elementary science instruction varies significantly between districts and schools. Yet, equitable science instruction, centered in students\u2019 experiences and communities, must start at an early age for all students to see themselves as participants in science and to see science as relevant to their lives. This project will support 16 Master Teacher Fellows in four high-needs districts in Northwest Washington to lead change toward equitable, high quality science instruction in elementary schools, while working with teacher educators at Western Washington University to align curriculum and practices in teacher preparation courses. In addition, two environmental education-focused community organizations will work with the teacher leaders to integrate place-based education into their science curricula.\r\n\r\nThis project at Western Washington University includes partnerships with four high-need school districts in Northwest Washington:  Bellingham, Mount Vernon, Nooksack, and Sedro-Woolley, as well as with the Skagit Conservation Education Alliance, Whatcom Coalition for Environmental Education, and the Northwest Educational Service District. Project goals include: (1) Building a teacher leadership model that will enact a shared vision of equitable, effective science education in participating schools; (2) Developing sustainable partnerships between elementary schools, higher education, and community organizations based on reciprocal learning that builds coherence between K-6 science education and teacher preparation; and (3) Generating knowledge about essential elements and outcomes of equity-focused teacher leader development. Research-based processes and tools will be used to enact a model of teacher leadership that uses networked improvement communities to enable rapid testing and evaluation of innovations targeting the schools\u2019 vision for science education. Principles of high-need school districts will participate in professional development.  They along with the Master Teacher Fellows will take leadership in creating the conditions to enact truly equitable, high-quality science education at the elementary level. This Track 3: Master Teaching Fellowships project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
