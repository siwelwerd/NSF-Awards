 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graduate education in STEM typically focuses on diving deep into the details in one particular field of study. Most graduate programs\u2019 curricula do not include opportunities to introduce trainees to other STEM fields because it would increase their time in training. However, research that combines disciplines drives much exciting discovery and innovation that often leads to new technologies and products. It is important for scientists in different fields to be able to communicate and work together to continue to drive the innovation and development that impacts our society. The fact that most institutions offer a wide array of STEM programs can be leveraged to bring trainees together with their peers in other disciplines and create a path to new collaborations and more breadth in scientific thinking with our next generation of researchers. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Washington University will determine whether a short, immersive experience that involves students from different STEM disciplines will enhance the cross-discipline communication, critical thinking, and networking among young scientists. The trainees will also develop skills in teamwork that are crucial to success as a researcher in both academic and non-academic work settings. The results will determine whether short, immersive experiences with trainees in a variety of disciplines working in teams can have added value in preparing them for interdisciplinary research and the workforce.\r\n\r\nThis project will immerse new graduate trainees in an interdisciplinary learning experience which models the collaborative nature of research and can be broadly utilized in STEM programs. Washington University has a breadth of bioscience programs that will be combined to create an opportunity for new graduate students to simultaneously develop their sense of community and belonging while working towards key core competencies (critical thinking, teamwork, scientific communication, career readiness) and establishing a wide network of peers in the Interdisciplinary Scientific Immersion Program (ISIP). The overarching goal of ISIP is to provide the framework to promote interdisciplinary knowledge and research at institutions that offer discipline-focused PhD training. The pedagogical method for ISIP is cooperative team-based learning, a methodology that has demonstrated significant advantages for learning for all students with the highest gains for those students from underrepresented backgrounds. The program will involve a wide range of faculty as team co-facilitators, and interdisciplinary student groups will work towards a common goal that will allow for varied learning experiences and cross-discipline peer networking. The developed program will be transferable to many types of STEM programs and institutions. The assessment tools that will be utilized include pre- and post- survey questions addressing self-assessment of confidence in: interdisciplinary communication skills, literature-based research, articulation of hypothesis, writing specific aims, and managing self and others. The added value of this program to traditional STEM PhD programs will be in actively promoting interdisciplinary thought and communication for new graduate students that will be transformative for many in both their thesis work and career readiness.\r\n\r\nThe Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
