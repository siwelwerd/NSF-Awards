 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nation\u2019s need for cybersecurity professionals with diverse training and backgrounds continues to grow. This project will further develop a competent cybersecurity workforce at California State University, Sacramento (Sacramento State). Sacramento State aims to produce cybersecurity professionals for Northern California, which is a thriving center of computer technology development, the seat of California\u2019s state government, and in close proximity to many federal agencies. The project will expand its reach to historically underrepresented groups including racial and ethnic minorities, women, and first-generation students, with the goal of attracting and developing STEM talent from diverse groups in cybersecurity. This builds on Sacramento State\u2019s prior success in securing cybersecurity employment for diverse SFS scholars, with a current goal of placing 85% in the federal executive branch. With its comparatively low state tuition rate, Sacramento State offers a cost-effective program for training cybersecurity experts. As a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) and an Asian American, Native American and Pacific Islander Serving Institution (AANAPISI), where 42% of the student body are historically underrepresented minorities, 45% are Pell-eligible, and 32% are first-generation students, Sacramento State is well positioned to broaden participation through this program. \r\n\r\nThe project will support 26 students in computer science, computer engineering, criminal justice, and management information systems at Sacramento State over a five-year period. It will expand research and education innovation opportunities for Sacramento State students in critical cybersecurity infrastructure. All SFS scholars will take part in a faculty-mentored research project exploring an array of pressing topics such as AI, trustworthy algorithms using blockchain infrastructure, robust authentication, analysis of cyber-attacks on dynamic control systems, and design of resilient control systems. This will enable faculty to involve interested students in their research, disseminate their research results, and update the program\u2019s cybersecurity curriculum to reflect the latest state of technology. The project will become more multidisciplinary, inviting students majoring in Management and Information Systems and Criminal Justice to participate. Finally, SFS scholars will conduct a survey of current trends and challenges in cybersecurity each year and make a presentation in a public forum, such as the State of California Cybersecurity Education Summit, to raise awareness.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
