 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical: In recent years Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly important area of research for academia, industry, and government because it has the potential to solve many important problems and thus benefit society. The goal of AI research is to create human-like abilities which can be grouped under the term \u201cintelligence\u201d, in computing machines. With these abilities, machines may be able to help create better conditions for humans and may accelerate scientific discovery. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is one of the categories of AI research which is seeing intense activity, and this is because it provides anyone with an internet connection the ability to hold conversations with a GAI through web interfaces like ChatGPT. These conversations can be about almost anything. By learning from large scale interactions, the GAIs are becoming better at providing good answers to challenging questions raised by the humans interacting with them. GAI technology such as Stable Diffusion, can render high-quality images based on written descriptions. According to experts GAI applications will see very high levels of adoption and will impact on many areas of work and productivity. The potential of GAI is high, but experts caution that it can produce inaccurate or harmful outputs. This is a planning project between Fayetteville State University (FSU) and the Laboratory of Analytic Sciences (LAS), with FSU as the lead institution. The project aims to work on planning to establish a research program focusing on use-inspired AI, specifically GAI, with a focus on enhancing analysis in the US Intelligence Community (IC). The project intends to bring together academia, the IC, and industry to define research thrusts, identify gaps, and develop a design and logic model which will create the foundations of a research program in this area, and will also generate at least one research proposal that will be submitted to NSF for funding. \r\n\r\nTechnical: The current state of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and its usability in holding conversations through web interfaces like ChatGPT is rapidly changing the adoption of AI in society. The use of multi-modal generative AI, such as Stable Diffusion, to render high-quality images based on written descriptions will impact many areas of work and productivity. The potential of GAI is high, but experts caution that it can produce inaccurate or harmful outputs. This project applications requests funding for a planning project between Fayetteville State University (FSU) and the Laboratory of Analytic Sciences (LAS), with FSU as the lead institution. The exploratory meetings of this planning project will be in-depth conversations, presentations and will create documentation describing the research needs, research problems, intellectual merit and broader impacts in the use of GAI to support the IC. The Intellectual Merit of the proposed planning grant is that it will create the roadmap for research and the network for creating an innovation ecosystem that can sustain progress in this important area. The Broader Impacts of this project will create a plan for developing basic and applied research opportunities. As an HBCU, FSU will be able to lead and generate interest in the application of advanced research to solve problems facing the IC, in many urgent matters related to national security. The service area of FSU includes Fort Liberty, which is the largest US Army base in the country. FSU was recently awarded the Purple Heart status in the UNC System. The broader impacts of this award will be amplified by FSU\u2019s deep connections to the military community where this project will create plans for further development of research opportunities related to the IC which has a significant presence in the Fort Bragg community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

By bringing together experts from academia, government, and industry, the project developed a comprehensive framework for leveraging generative AI to enhance intelligence workflows. Specific achievements included defining core research questions around AI&rsquo;s ability to support the creation of IC content, probabilistically fill in unknowns, automate workflows for large datasets, and build trust in AI-generated outputs. The project&rsquo;s intellectual merit lies in establishing a research design and identifying actionable research domains that will not only advance generative AI technology but also provide valuable insights into its application in high-stakes, real-world environments. The outcomes have created a foundation for use-inspired research that aligns with national security objectives, providing a blueprint for future projects focused on the integration of generative AI in intelligence environments. This project&rsquo;s broader impacts are far-reaching, particularly in advancing Fayetteville State University&rsquo;s (FSU&rsquo;s) role as an HBCU with strong ties to the military community at Fort Bragg. The collaboration with the Laboratory of Analytic Sciences (LAS) of NC State University (NCSU) has enabled FSU to become a focal point for advancing generative AI research within the IC, fostering educational and professional opportunities for underrepresented students in the field. As a result of the project, FSU has not only deepened its partnership with LAS in shaping research that addresses both the technological and societal dimensions of AI in national security. The project has led to the submission of a research grant to the HBCU Excellence in Research program with FSU as the lead, LAS/NCSU as sub-awardee, Booz Allen Hamilton as industry partner, and a Chief Data Officer of Military Intelligence as collaborator. The project team is ready to submit to other request for proposals as matching opportunities are released by funding agencies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over the course of the project, the project team engaged in several strategic activities that expanded the project&rsquo;s network and amplified its impact. These activities included a series of speaking engagements, conferences, and collaborative sessions that connected the project team with key stakeholders and experts in military and defense data intelligence. Notable activities included invitations to speak at key events. Dr. Bhattacharya (PI) was invited as a speaker at the Data Literacy Train-the-Trainer event at West Point, where he introduced the concepts of generative AI and its potential in intelligence analysis to a military audience. This led to important introductions and connections within Military Intelligence, significantly broadening the project&rsquo;s network within the defense community. Following the success of his talk at West Point, Dr. Bhattacharya was invited to speak at a second event focused on generative AI for Military Intelligence. This opportunity led to an introduction to the Chief Data Officer for Military Intelligence, enhancing the project's visibility and relevance within military intelligence circles and providing insights into specific applications and challenges in intelligence analysis. Dr. Bhattacharya&rsquo;s attendance at the Army Data Summit at Fort Liberty connected the project with additional experts, including a Senior AI Engineer from Booz Allen Hamilton. These connections have established ongoing lines of collaboration and knowledge exchange, particularly with Booz Allen Hamilton, which has a wealth of expertise in operationalizing AI in secure, high-stakes environments. This relationship has proven invaluable for aligning the project&rsquo;s research goals with the practical needs of the IC.</p>\n<p>Throughout the project, the FSU team maintained active collaboration with LAS researchers, focusing on shaping the research program&rsquo;s goals and objectives. Together, they worked on defining the scope of the research, delineating research subdomains, and formulating preliminary research questions. These collaborative sessions informed the project&rsquo;s final design document and logic model, which outline a clear path for generative AI research tailored to intelligence applications. In-depth discussions and documentation with LAS led to a detailed understanding of the specific research needs and areas of impact for generative AI within the IC.
