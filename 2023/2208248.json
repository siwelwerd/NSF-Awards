 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel, portable, diagnostic device for non-invasively diagnosing myocardial infarctions (MI) and ischemia in real-time with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. The system aims to provide an accurate point-of-care clinical classification for the 805,000 heart attack cases occurring in the US each year with a real-time diagnostic and monitoring tool. The system aims to significantly reduce the time needed with current invasive sampling and blood analysis measures, thereby improving patient outcomes during the first critical hours of an MI while saving healthcare resources and improving efficiency. The portable nature of the technology enables other forms of integration including at home, in clinic, hospital bedside use, or field use applications.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a proof-of-concept diagnostic-prognostic machine learning-based system for detecting MI. The scope of activities includes testing multiple techniques and models and producing distribution analyses and event plots of training data in order to optimize performance compared to clinically adjudicated events. Success measures include a data model which, when using their proprietary external noninvasive transdermal biomarker sensor with their wearable garment electrocardiograms (EKGs), are able to detect MI with > 85% accuracy.  The device will also be able to detect clinically relevant ischemia with > 85% accuracy. These results will progress the company\u2019s objective of completing a standalone, noninvasive, real-time diagnostic and remote monitoring tool.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The sooner treatment is initiated, the more heart muscle can be preserved, leading to better functional outcomes and a reduced risk of heart failure. Quick reperfusion, whether achieved through thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous coronary intervention, limits the extent of myocardial necrosis. Secondly, early intervention can prevent life-threatening arrhythmias and other complications associated with AMI. Moreover, timely treatment not only improves short-term survival rates but also has a long-lasting impact on patients' morbidity and overall quality of life. In essence, the early management of AMI can be the difference between life and death, and even when survival is assured, it can dictate the difference between a life lived fully and one hampered by cardiac limitations. Measurement of cardiac troponin levels, as a marker of myocyte necrosis, is routinely recommended in patients presenting with ACS, with blood draws required within a recommended turnaround time of 60 minutes. A potential solution to avoiding delay during symptoms of acute coronary artery occlusion is to implement a point-of-care tool that confirms and accurately risk-stratify patients with suspected MI. Although point-of-care tests for estimating high-sensitivity cardiac Troponin are available, currently, there are no hand-held devices approved for clinical use by the FDA.</p>\n<p>This multicenter, observational study aimed to test the feasibility of implementing a remotely analyzable, Transdermal-ISS with machine learning analytics in the clinical setting for predicting elevated circulating high-sensitivity cardiac Troponin I (hs-cTnI) level during a single time-point evaluation of patients hospitalized with ACS. Consenting and executing research for patients with ACSs can be challenging, considering the need to implement the device for several minutes of recordings with a parallel blood draw while encountering confounding patient-related factors like stress, pain, the use of analgesics or sedatives and time-sensitive therapies. Serum hs-cTnI levels increase within 3 to 4 hours after the onset of symptoms and remain high for up to 4 to 7 days. We, therefore, sought a head-to-head comparison of hs-cTnI levels and Transdermal-ISS recordings at a single random time point during the hospital stay after the patient was clinically stabilized to develop and validate deep-learning models for predicting elevated hs-cTnI.</p>\n<p>The key objective of this Phase I project was: Clinical differentiation of acute myocardial infarction (MI) from unstable angina and other presentations mimicking acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is critical for implementing time-sensitive interventions and optimizing outcomes. However, the diagnostic steps are dependent on blood draws and laboratory turn-around times.
