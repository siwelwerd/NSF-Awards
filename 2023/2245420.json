 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides core operational support to enable the ongoing work of START International to develop comprehensive science capacity development programs, projects and actions in Africa and Asia. Support for START serves to advance the strategic aims the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) with respect to the US Government\u2019s commitment to supporting stronger scientific capacities in low and middle-income countries. START is able to accomplish this through USGCRP's core support of its operations that allows the organization to seek broader support for projects and other activities from other governments, private foundations, and multilateral bodies. Core support for START is critical for advancing the organization\u2019s mission to cultivate, inspire and connect emerging science leaders in Africa and Asia to work with societal partners in creating a more sustainable and equitable future. \r\n\r\nThis project will enable START to create new programs and partnerships that provide comprehensive capacity development in Africa and Asia through skill-building, scientific leadership, and experiential learning. START\u2019s work primarily targets early-career researchers and sustainability professionals who engage with global change science in the areas of adaptation, climate finance, renewable energy, human health and climate, and urban resilience among other themes. In the period covered by this project, START will continue to build on its collaborations with Future Earth and the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), and in doing so bring START's knowledge and expertise to these collaborations, such as through a collaboration with the WCRP in developing new actions in Africa related to the emerging Regional Information for Society project, and with Future Earth related to skill building for transdisciplinary research and science leadership.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
