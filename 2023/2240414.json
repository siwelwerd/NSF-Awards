 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) Quantum Manufacturing award will support research to generate scientific knowledge for the manufacturing of light-based miniaturized quantum devices. The extreme performance enhancements in computing, sensing, and communications that are enabled by quantum effects have the potential to transform both science and technology in various fields. Although many of these effects have already been demonstrated in research laboratories, practical low-cost quantum devices are not widely available. A major limitation is the need for bulky optical components to manipulate light within these devices. It is possible to miniaturize these optical components through nanoscale structures, but such structures can neither be fabricated rapidly nor in the variety of shapes required for extensive manipulation of light. This award supports fundamental research to generate the knowledge required to rapidly print fine nanoscale structures of various shapes and to convert these structures into functional optical devices. Miniaturized optics can transform quantum devices from expensive and bulky table-top systems into affordable and small palm-top devices. This work can therefore make quantum technology widely accessible and thereby improve national security, increase U.S. economic competitiveness, and enhance the quality of life. By training students from different backgrounds in the emerging area of quantum manufacturing, this project will help develop a globally competitive and diverse STEM workforce. \r\n\r\nNanoscale 3D printing based on projection two-photon lithography can print polymeric volumetric pixels (i.e., voxels) on the 100 nm scale for meta-photonics but these voxels are limited in shape and do not have the desired optical properties. Controlling the size and shape of the voxels is critical to achieving the desired optical function, but the process parameter combinations for achieving the desired geometries are unknown. Additionally, there is limited knowledge on pattern transfer techniques for converting 3D polymeric structures into optical materials as most techniques are optimized for 2D structures. This project will fill these knowledge gaps and generate a set of meta-photonics design rules and building blocks that optimally leverage the capabilities and avoid the limitations of the manufacturing approach. The objectives will be achieved through a combination of empirical studies and physics-based modeling of the printing and pattern-transfer processes as well as through meta-photonic device design, fabrication, and testing. This effort will provide the initial step for the necessary roadmap for the design and manufacturing of the meta-photonic devices that can enable wavefront engineering for quantum applications using the approach, similar to the process design kits of the foundry-based fabrication processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
