HotMobile 2023, sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE, is held in Orange County, CA, February 22-23, 2023. \r\nHotMobile is the premier workshop targeting mobile computing and system integration fields. Attending this event will benefit the scientific progress of the student's research. The exposure to the technical content of HotMobile 2023 will inspire students to address the tough problems in their respective fields, with a long-term benefit of scientific advances in mobile computing.\r\n\r\nPriority will be given to students who will benefit from attending this workshop but are unlikely to attend due to the unavailability of travel funding. In addition, applications from female and underrepresented groups in mobile computing research will be strongly encouraged. Approximately 20 students will receive travel grants from this award to attend HotMobile 2023.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
