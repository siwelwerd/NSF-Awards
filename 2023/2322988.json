 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA), renowned as the premier forum for cutting-edge advancements in computer architecture, offers an exceptional platform for exchange of state-of-the art research. This award provides travel support for up to 75 students attending this flagship conference on June 17-21, 2023, in Orlando, FL. Over the past five decades, ISCA has played a pivotal role in fostering remarkable progress within the computing industry. Distinguished attendees, representing both academia and industry from all over the world, contribute to the conference\u2019s diverse and vibrant atmosphere. Within a wide array of sessions, the conference encompasses the latest developments across many categories, including core microarchitecture topics, machine learning, security, and much more. The keynotes delve into the historical technological advancements of the past 50 years as chronicled through ISCA publications. Through engaging social events, students have the invaluable opportunity to interact with esteemed leaders in computing, both seasoned professionals and rising stars. In 2023, ISCA proudly commemorates its 50th anniversary, coinciding with the Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC), a collection of high-quality conferences and workshops in the broader field of Computer Science, held once every four years.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of this award are threefold. Firstly, by promoting increased student participation, it amplifies the visibility of the groundbreaking research being presented while honoring the 50-year legacy of this premier conference. Secondly, undergraduate and junior graduate students gain access to exclusive programs such as \u201cMeet a Senior Architect\u201d and \u201cMeet a Senior Student,\u201d which foster meaningful communication and interactions with experienced professionals. These initiatives enhance the conference experience by providing valuable mentorship opportunities. Lastly, the travel award places a particular emphasis on supporting students from traditionally underrepresented groups, aligning with ISCA\u2019s commitment to diversity and inclusion. By addressing financial barriers, the award strives to create a more inclusive environment that reflects the broad spectrum of talent in the field of computer Architecture.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
