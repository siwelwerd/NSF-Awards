 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gallium oxide is an emerging ultrawidebandgap (UWBG) semiconductor that has attracted a lot of interest in recent years for next generation power and wireless applications. The gallium oxide device performance has been phenomenal in terms of breakdown voltages and device figures of merit. This performance enhancement has been underpinned by the availability of large area bulk substrates. Despite this progress there are still significant challenges both at the fundamental materials understanding and the device technology transition to real world applications. To foster fruitful discussions, collaborations and student training, the 6th US Gallium Oxide Workshop is organized in August 13-16, 2023, at the University at Buffalo (SUNY) campus in Buffalo, NY. \r\n\r\nThis premier US domestic conference will provide researchers and students with a broad platform to present their results. By supporting student participation, this project will contribute towards workforce development. The project will also increase the participation of underrepresented minority (URM) students. In addition to presenting their work, the students will get an opportunity to listen to three keynote speakers and twelve invited speakers presented by academic and industry leaders. The conference will cover a wide range of topics in gallium oxide and related materials (theory, synthesis, characterization, devices, circuits, and systems), thus casting a wide net to capture more diverse students and attendees. All these topics have strong positive social impact both in terms of economic and energy security. The activities will increase the knowledge base in semiconductor manufacturing which is a significant contributor to the US economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
