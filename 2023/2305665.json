 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2023, Broadening Participation of Groups Underrepresented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Climate change is having profound effects on animal populations around the world. When faced with warming temperatures, species commonly shift their range to higher latitudes or elevations in search of more optimal habitat. However, these shifts can vary immensely in direction and magnitude within and among species, and the underlying mechanisms of range shifts from an organismal level remain poorly understood. This project will build a framework to understand the complex factors that influence animal responses to a changing climate, better informing conservation decisions. To broaden the impact of this project, the Fellow will engage with community stakeholders and crowdsourced data, and implement near-peer mentoring networks and fieldwork support grants to broaden participation of those from underrepresented backgrounds.\r\n \r\nThe project will focus on responses to changing climate by (1) synthesizing available data on range shifts and traits to build predictive models of climate induced range shift and (2) using passive camera trap arrays to study habitat preferences and behavior of a wide-ranging focal species. For the first objective, the Fellow will review documented cases of climate-induced range shift across mammal species and then conduct a meta-analysis to identify relationships between a species\u2019 ecological and behavioral traits and range shift; these relationships will then be used to parameterize models to forecast future ranges. The second objective will use field surveys of the bobcat, Lynx rufus, along its northern range front, where it has been expanding its range northward in certain localities. Multiple camera-trap arrays will be set up from the range edge to interior; a survey will then be done of local environmental characteristics in order to determine individual habitat preferences and assess differences in individual behavior across the range front. This project will have the unique distinction of integrating organismal, field-based approaches with large-scale quantitative modeling to provide a more robust understanding of the mechanisms underlying climate-induced range shifts. To broaden participation of groups underrepresented in biology, the Fellow will implement peer mentoring networks among undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral scientists centered around \u201cResearch Mixer\u201d events. In addition, the Fellow will implement a fieldwork grant program to financially support students working with postdoctoral mentors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
