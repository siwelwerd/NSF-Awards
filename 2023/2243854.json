 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the renewal of an REU Site in pure and applied mathematics at Kansas State University. This summer research program hosts ten undergraduate students per year for eight weeks. Students conduct original research on a variety of topics in pure and applied mathematics, and publish results in peer reviewed mathematics journals when possible. In addition, the program offers professional development activities, including workshops in mathematical typesetting and presentation tools, training in computational tools as needed to work on the projects, and talks by philosophy faculty on logic, mathematical epistemology and ethics. The REU program includes a student-organized mini conference. Social activities are coordinated with other REU sites on the Kansas State University campus. The recruitment plan emphasizes community colleges, Historically Black Colleges, minority-serving institutions, and regional liberal arts colleges.\r\n\r\nParticipants in this REU site work on problems in the areas of complex analysis, computational imaging, topology, and number theory. Professional development components of the program include workshops on mathematics presentation tools as well as computational tools such as MATLAB and Python programming. The program is committed to promoting participation of women, under-represented minorities and economically disadvantaged individuals, and refers a number of students to become Math Alliance scholars. Past participants in this renewal REU site have published the outcomes of work done during the program in research journals in the topical areas described above.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
