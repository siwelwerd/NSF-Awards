However, the cyber security research front has continuously moved forward with recent developments in internet of things, artificial intelligence, social media, quantum computing in a post-covid world, requiring a rethinking of future directions. and a new investment strategy and investment priorities of the NSF SaTC program. This proposal outlines the background, structure, and timeline for the SaTC 2.0 strategic planning activity, as well as the development of a SaTC 2.0 vision document. The effort will begin with pre-planning and information gathering activities, followed by a multi-day, working workshop. The outcomes from the workshop will be a collection of recommendations and ideas for the future of cybersecurity research (over the next 10 years). \r\n\r\nThe SaTC v2 workshop and the vision document will help NSF to revamp its flagship cyber security research program through increased partnerships and collaboration among academia, industry, government, and to achieve NSF\u2019s long-term goal of increasing diversity to improve the well-being of traditionally underrepresented individuals in society, improving national security and enhancing our nation\u2019s competitiveness, and building a better infrastructure for research and education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
