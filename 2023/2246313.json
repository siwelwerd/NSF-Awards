 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies indicate that climate change impacts will dramatically increase vulnerabilities in rural communities where those living off the land are at increasing risk from extreme weather events such as heat waves, famine and drought. Additionally, more than 80% of the world is at risk from at least one vector-borne disease, and Malaria is a leading cause of death in the developing world. However, most research in this field addresses this public health crisis in the form of pesticides, chemical interventions and genetically modified mosquitos with little consideration for the role of the built environment, particularly in limited resource settings. Recent efforts to make housing more protective, however, often lead to dwellings that have reduced air transmission and provide substandard air quality and interior comfort conditions. Additionally, modern, sustainable buildings can be technologically complex and prohibitively expensive. The brick, however, is the most commonly used building material in the world and one third of the world\u2019s population lives in buildings which are totally or partially made from earth. By studying the material aspects of this humble material in tandem with the synergistic relationships of heat, energy, emissions, water, information and resources that make up a city\u2019s public services, a novel brick has the potential to become a greater part of the urban resiliency and public health strategy. Working collaboratively in the classroom and abroad, U.S. engineering and architecture students will design innovative ways to reconceive modular earthen materials to challenge existing norms of construction and material science. \r\n\r\nThis multidisciplinary proposal joins faculty mentors from four diverse specialties \u2013 architecture, engineering, entomology, and social anthropology \u2013 to address the significant impact of the domestic environment on public health and resiliency in rural Tanzania. U.S. student researchers from architecture and engineering will work collaboratively to explore the capability of masonry construction materials made from accessible, low-impact resources to control the transfer of heat, moisture and mosquitos in rural housing in Tanzania, exploring the intersection between design, disease and a rapidly changing climate. The primary objectives of this IRES effort are to (1) develop strategies for accessible and immediately deployable modular building materials in rapidly developing, hot-humid regions afflicted by mosquitoes, (2) expand the role of climate-adapted building materials with the potential for mosquito protection to support the resiliency and public health efforts of rural communities, and (3) provide community-based research and design experience for U.S. students in a hands-on context that promotes skill development, application of technical knowledge and professional development in an interdisciplinary environment with complex relationships of culture and science in a rapidly changing climate. This interdisciplinary group of students will work with local materials and regional experts to develop prototypes for low-cost buildings and construction technologies that improve occupant comfort while reducing the potential for intrusion of disease-carrying mosquitos. Though this project focuses on one mosquito-stricken country, it is our hope that the pathogen host interaction and thermal mitigation strategies would be applicable to other tropical regions, benefiting those who are likely to be most impacted by rapid development in a changing climate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
