 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to promote the advancement of intellectual leadership within TCUP institutions that will support them in addressing the scientific or engineering priorities of their tribes, communities, or broadly of the United States. Linked with this goal is the TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers) funding strand which provides support for TCUP institutions in establishing thematically based centers whose work applies the college\u2019s STEM instruction and research capacity to realize benefits for their identified community. The Kiai Loko Center for Limu Research, conceived and managed by personnel from the University of Hawaii - Windward Community College, directly aligns with the TEA Center concept in the significant positive impacts it will have on the local Native Hawaiian (NH) community and Native Hawaiian culture generally. The Center partners WCC with non-profit STEM organizations and local knowledge keepers in two major goals: 1) advancing cross disciplinary knowledge of aquaculture and limu (algae) ecology in support of community needs; and 2) training the next generation of Native Hawaiian STEM professionals knowledgeable in these realms.  A slate of comprehensive activities will be undertaken that includes the support of student-led research addressing a community-determined agenda around limu and the completion of STEM certificates that will prepare NH students for entry into the STEM workforce or the pursuit of higher STEM education.\r\n\r\nThe Kiai Loko Center for Limu Research focuses on the application of traditional Native Hawaiian knowledge alongside Western scientific methods in the study of questions important to Native Hawaiians related to limu and the traditional Hawaiian fishpond. Aquacultural practices employed in the maintenance of healthy fishponds and the production of limu are important aspects of traditional Native Hawaiian lifestyles that contribute to critical contemporary issues such as food security, biodiversity, and cultural perpetuation. The Center\u2019s five-year objectives partner community members, Native Hawaiian cultural experts, and STEM professionals in engaging 120 Native Hawaiian high school students in culturally relevant STEM courses, student internships, and the completion of STEM certificates that prepare students for positions as aquaculture technicians. Student-led research will address limu-related issues of importance to NH people, advancing the knowledge base surrounding limu ecology and production. The development of academic pathways will support students in transitioning to and completing STEM college degrees and entry into additional STEM professions. Research findings will be disseminated widely at community and professional meetings and through scientific publications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
