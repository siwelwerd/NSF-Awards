The main goal of the workshop is to educate and enhance collaboration among early career scientists in the quickly evolving field of \u201chot QCD\u201d, more specifically QCD thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, non-equilibrium transport theory, and applications of AdS/CFT in heavy-ion collisions.  The workshop will provide an informal environment for junior researchers to interact, exchange ideas, and form a community of researchers.  Involving junior researchers in this workshop will provide an opportunity for them to learn about fundamental nuclear physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
