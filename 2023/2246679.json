 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of US-based researchers in the \"Quasiworld Workshop\", a mathematics conference held August 14-18, 2023 at the University of Helsinki, Finland. The event provides an excellent opportunity for the participants, especially those who are at an early stage in their career, to learn new developments in their field and to potentially establish collaborations with international experts. Supporting US researchers to attend the conference therefore contributes to the growth of mathematics in the United States. \r\n \r\nThe focus of the conference is on the intersection of the mathematical fields of geometry, analysis, dynamics, and probability. There have been a number of recent breakthroughs involving the interaction between two or more of these different areas, and it is important for US-based mathematicians to stay informed about these developments. Opportunities to learn from and form collaborations with international researchers are invaluable, especially for early-career researchers, and such opportunities have been particularly scarce in recent years. More information about the meeting is available at https://www.helsinki.fi/en/conferences/quasiworld-workshop.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
