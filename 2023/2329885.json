 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation \u2013 Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project lies on reducing waste and energy use, while improving crop quality and yield. This will be done through the development and implementation of a revolutionary sensor technology that uses print-based manufacturing approaches. The technology will integrate nutrient, temperature, and pH sensors that can be used directly in the growing media and enable increased automation in controlled environments for outdoor and indoor agriculture operations. This project enhances the scientific and technological understanding of crop systems in a way that benefits both the public and industry by providing continuous, robust, and reliable data collection at a fraction of the cost of existing methods. Specifically, the proposed innovation will give growers the information they need to make informed, effective, and real-time decisions about fertilizer and water management. As agricultural lands become less available and fertilizers become increasingly expensive, this technology answers a critical need that will make practices sustainable. The adoption of this novel sensor technology will enable streamlined processes, improved productivity, resource optimization and food security, profitability, and economic growth, and contribute to a sustainable and competitive future.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project addresses the pressing need for more efficient and reliable data acquisition in existing agricultural workflows. Taking advantage of this novel sensor technology, the project aims to overcome the limitations of manual data collection, thereby minimizing human error and streamlining operations. The research objectives of this project encompass the design, development, manufacturing, and validation in controlled environments for outdoor and indoor agriculture systems by developing nitrogen/phosphorous/potassium (NPK), and electrical conductivity, hydrogen potential, temperature (EC/pH/T) sensors. The participation of an industrial partner in the agriculture industry in the project will ensure the developed technology is suitable for use in commercial operations and adaptable to the various environmental conditions and agricultural application scenarios. Experimentation and validation carried out during the project will demonstrate the technical capabilities and benefits of these sensors, including enhanced data accuracy, ability to provide continuous in-situ monitoring, and improved maintenance procedures. Successful integration of the NPK and EC/pH/T sensor technology will uncover new scientific knowledge and will empower industries to achieve higher levels of productivity, sustainability, and economic competitiveness, positioning them at the forefront of innovation and growth.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
