 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST), this project aims to develop a nationally recognized center in bioinformatics research and training at Texas State University (TXST), a minority serving institution (MSI). Bioinformatics skills, broadly defined as approaches for processing and analyzing large biological data, are increasingly in demand in the national workforce. However, underrepresented minority (URM) groups are poorly embodied among STEM graduates with bioinformatics training. The proposed center will bring together a diverse group of scientists applying bioinformatic approaches to ecological and evolutionary research. Furthermore, our project will address gaps in the recruitment and training of URM students in bioinformatic-related fields by creating new curriculum as part of an undergraduate training pipeline. At the graduate level, the center staff will transform existing bioinformatics coursework into a PhD program. Combined, these efforts will directly address national gaps in the training of URM in bioinformatics and augment efforts to create a nationally recognized bioinformatics center.\r\n\r\nThis project supports the initial development of a research and training center in bioinformatics through preparation of a Bioinformatics CREST center proposal. Bioinformatics and related fields are among the fastest growing sectors in the US. However, URMs remain poorly represented within the broader bioinformatic workforce. A robust group of faculty at TXST are currently working with bioinformatics approaches and offering graduate training in bioinformatic skills. The program will build upon these strengths to develop: 1) a synergistic group of researchers working with bioinformatics, 2) undergraduate bioinformatic training, and 3) plans for center evaluation and sustainability. The CREST program provides support to enhance the research capabilities of minority-serving institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
