 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) operates R/V Sikuliaq, a 261-foot, global class, ice-capable oceanographic research vessel owned by the NSF as part of the Academic Research Fleet (ARF) fleet. Sikuliaq provides a general-purpose platform for multidisciplinary research missions from polar to temperate latitudes. The ship was delivered in 2014 and has completed seven years of funded operations. UAF requests funds to purchase oceanographic instrumentation that would enhance the vessel\u2019s capability in support of NSF sponsored research to be undertaken on Sikuliaq in the future. The proposed instrumentation would be operated on a shared-use basis within the UNOLS framework and maintained by the UAF/Sikuliaq oceanographic technical services group in support of NSF-funded scientists who require use of such seagoing facilities. UAF requests funds for the purchase, installation, and integration of a Kongsberg EM304 Mark II Multibeam Echosounder (MBES).\r\n\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
