 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 2023 and 2024 Maurice Auslander International Conference, which will be held at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Quissett Campus in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA from April 26 to May 1, 2023, and again in the last week of April, 2024.The Maurice Auslander International Conference, held annually since 2002, is intended to be a center of activity for the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras in the United States. The conference will be a combination workshop/conference/student presentation event. It will serve three principal objectives: to improve understanding of basic background knowledge in the field of representations of finite dimensional algebras and related topics, to keep participants up to date on the newest developments in the field, and to give young American researchers an opportunity to showcase their results in front of an international audience. \r\n\r\nMaurice Auslander was an influential mathematician at Brandeis University, widely known for his work in the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. The Maurice Auslander International Conference brings together mathematicians from Representation Theory and related areas of Combinatorics, Invariant Theory, Commutative Algebra, Homological Algebra, and Mathematical Physics. Each day of the conference will start with an expository lecture by a known international expert in various fields of Algebra, Combinatorics or related fields, keeping to the central theme of Representation Theory. This will be followed by one or two student presentations explaining the results that the students have obtained for their PhD thesis. The rest of the lectures will be traditional conference talks. Information on the upcoming conference, as well as records for  previous years, can be found at http://www.northeastern.edu/martsinkovsky/p/MADL/MADL.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
