 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract: Leveraging novel quantum systems to realize measuring devices beyond classical capabilities and expanding their applications to a broader scientific community is at the heart of modern quantum science. This project exploits the power of nanodiamond-based quantum sensors in the field of bioenergy research to investigate the biomass pretreatment process, a crucial step toward the production of sustainable biofuels. By developing a cell imaging microscope with quantum sensing capabilities, the research team plans to investigate the structure change of biomass in real-time, which will help to accelerate the optimization of bioenergy production efficiency. On the educational and outreach front, the research team will introduce the developed quantum imaging microscope as a shared facility to the researchers at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. Moreover, the researcher team plans to create a new summer course and research experience on quantum information for undergraduate and master students, which helps to motivate and prepare them to pivot to the brand-new and exciting opportunities enabled by quantum science.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: The overarching goal of this project is to apply quantum-enabled sensing technology based upon nitrogen-vacancy defects and other color centers in nanodiamonds to directly visualize and image in real-time the structure change of lignocellulosic biomass during the pretreatment process. First, an existing cell imaging microscope at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville will be modified and upgraded to detect and optimize nanodiamond quantum sensors. Second, a robust and efficient functionalization procedure is developed for nanodiamond surfaces to attach cellulase/xylanase enzymes. Finally, the structure change of lignocellulosic biomass during pretreatment is imaged and investigated, which helps to explore the optimal conditions for pretreatment processes. Compared to conventional spectroscopy methods for this task, nanodiamond quantum sensors feature several unique advantages: (1) the ability to image and track in real-time biomass components in situ; (2) the potential to label and differentiate different components of biomass (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) with different colors of nanodiamonds; (3) the capability to actively modulate the signal intensity of nanodiamonds sensors and isolate them from the background fluorescence (background-free).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (MPS/OMA), and the Technology Frontiers Program (TIP/TF).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
