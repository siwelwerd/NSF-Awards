 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ACM Sigmetrics 2023 conference will be held at the Orlando World Marriott in Orlando, Florida, USA between June 19\u201323, 2023. Sigmetrics 2023 will be part of the ACM Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC) 2023, and will thus be colocated with other leading conferences in other communities including ISCA 2023, STOC 2023, PODC 2023, SPAA 2023, and PLDI 2023.The SIGMETRICS conference is primarily focusing on the performance analysis, measurement, and modeling of networked computer systems. ACM SIGMETRICS 2023 aims to provide a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further our knowledge and understanding of the measurement, modeling, analysis, and design of computing and networked systems. The conference interprets computer systems broadly, including traditional computing systems as well as social networks, data networks, and other types of systems. Contributions containing highly original ideas, new approaches, and/or ground-breaking results are particularly encouraged.\r\n\r\nThis grant provides travel support for about 25 US based students to attend the SIGMETRICS 2023 conference. The support will make possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference. Particular attention will be paid to directing support towards various underrepresented population. SIGMETRICS brings together professionals from a wide variety of academic and industrial backgrounds; student participants will thus get the opportunity to interact with mentors and peers of varying gender, ethnicity, and background. Students will also benefit from the student-centric events, including a student workshop/panel and a student research competition.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
