 "awd_abstract_narration": "Complete and faithful digital reconstruction of the real world is critical to many applications, such as virtual and augmented reality, holographic rendering, autonomous driving, digital cultural heritage preservation, virtual architecture and interior design. The physical world consists of objects made with different materials that give them diverse appearances. Scanning a scene with high visual diversity is challenging. All existing 3D scanning systems are limited to specific types of surfaces that they can work for. For example, some only works for the matte surfaces while some are designed for highly reflective ones. Therefore, there is need to devise a generic solution for digitalizing the real-world surfaces with diverse appearances. This project will result in an integrated solution for reconstructing general surfaces, regardless of their appearances. The outcome will significantly simplify the 3D scanning procedure and allow wide use of this technology by the general public. In addition, this research will be integrated into the curricula of new courses on computer vision and computational imaging at Louisiana State University.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop robust, fast, and accurate polarization-based imaging system for reconstructing general surfaces, ranging from diffuse to purely specular. This research is motivated by the fact that the polarization state of light embeds essential information on light transport. To achieve the goal, this project has two research thrusts: 1) formulate a polarization-inclusive light transport framework and 2) develop a practical system for reconstructing general surfaces. The first thrust will characterize the transformation of polarization after light interacts with surfaces of various reflectance properties. This framework provides the theoretical foundation for system development. The second thrust will design new programmable polarization-coded light sources and cameras, by leveraging recent advances in polarization sensors and optics. New physics-based 3D surface reconstruction algorithms will be developed through polarization analysis. Result of this project is expected to breakthrough major limitations of existing 3D scanning technology on general applicability.\r\napplicability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Throughout the project period, we have developed practical imaging systems and algorithms that leverage the polarization property of light for robust and accurate 3D reconstruction of a broad range of surfaces. Below, we summarize our key finding and major activities.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Polarimetric Helmholtz Stereopsis. </strong>We derived theories and developed hardware systems and software algorithms that use the reciprocity of polarized light for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. It&rsquo;s well known that the intensity-based reflectance function, bidirectional reflectance distribution function or BRDF, follows the Helmholtz reciprocity principle: the BRDF value remains the same when the optical path is reversed. However, this principle cannot be directly applied when the polarization state of light is considered. We investigated the reciprocity relationship when the polarization states of incident and outgoing light are unrestricted, and theoretically derived a transpositional reciprocity relationship based on the Stokes-Mueller formalism. We demonstrated this principle by applying it to perform Helmholtz Stereopsis (HS) using polarized light. HS is a 3D reconstruction method that exploits the reciprocity principle of BRDF by swapping the camera and light source positions. It has the benefit of being robust and independent of surface type, but requires at least three reciprocal image pairs to solve for surface normal. In contrast, by exploiting the polarimetric reciprocity principle, our method can perform 3D reconstruction with only one reciprocity pair, which greatly simplifies the capture process. We constructed a physical prototype for experimental validation. Results show that we are able to achieve high-quality 3D reconstruction for a variety of surfaces. Sample result and prototype system are shown in Figure 1. This work was published in ICCV 2021 as an oral presentation. We then extended the polarimetric constraints from orthographic projection to the more general perspective projection, and used the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) to refine the depth and normal estimation of degenerate case when only one pair is used. This improved method was published on the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Polar-Photometric Stereo.</strong> We then developed a versatile and flexible 3D shape reconstruction method that can be performed under unknown and uncontrolled natural illumination. Our method combined photometric and polarimetric cues. We exploited the use of circular polarization for enhancing both cues for 3D reconstruction. Specifically,&nbsp;we developed an imaging system with two circularly polarized spotlights for boosting the polarization cues corrupted by the environment lighting. We developed an optimization algorithm for solving surface normals with two polarization images by combining the polarimetric and photometric constraints. To mitigate the effect of uncontrolled environment light in photometric constraints, we estimated a lighting proxy map and iteratively refine the normal and lighting estimation. We performed experiments under both indoor and outdoor environment. Results demonstrated that our method is able to achieve good accurate and robust on various types of objects in flexible environment. Sample results and prototype system are shown in Figure 2. This work was published in 3DV 2022 as a spotlight presentation.</p>\r\n<p>The project has resulted in three conference and journal publications in top venues in computer vision and computational imaging. We have filed two non-provisional patent applications, with one awarded in 2024.
