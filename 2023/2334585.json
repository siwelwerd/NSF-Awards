 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given the underrepresentation of Native students in STEM higher education and Native faculty at higher education institutions, AISES recognizes the need to support Native serving tribal and non-tribal institutions in securing STEM research funding. To that end, AISES in collaboration with the National Science Foundation (NSF) will develop and host an NSF Grantsmanship Workshop to be held during the pre-conference day of the AISES National Conference in Spokane, Washington, October 19-21, 2023. The goal of the NSF Grantsmanship Workshop is to provide professional development in NSF grant proposal development through the Workshop, as well as the professional development and network building opportunities at the AISES National Conference, to faculty from Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) and Native American-Serving Non-Tribal Institution (NASNTI). \r\n\r\nThis workshop will potentially impact the STEM research infrastructure at institutions serving Native students. Faculty participants will learn about NSF programs and how to develop proposals to address their research and teaching needs. Faculty will be able to expose their students to STEM research, which will help in their recruitment and retention in STEM. The long term goal is to improve the capacity for Native and Native-serving faculty to pursue new funding to support STEM research opportunities. Given the significant underrepresentation of Native students, professionals, and faculty in STEM fields, AISES believes now is a critical time to focus on strengthening the STEM research infrastructure of Native-serving institutions to move the needle on increasing representation of STEM research by Native faculty and thereby increasing the impact on STEM persistence among Native students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
