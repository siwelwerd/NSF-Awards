 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of a dynamic geospatial database that can be mined to further develop precision models of soil moisture and farm productivity that will aid small- to medium-sized farms. These farms cover almost 75% of the operating farmland in the U.S. Large companies in the agriculture industry benefit from the collection of digital farm data however, smaller farms are disadvantaged by the inaccessibility of agricultural digital innovation systems. The availability of timely digital information as inputs to field conditions will help small- to mid-sized farmers optimize their yields and potentially generate greater revenue. The proposed database will integrate multiscale and multivariate imaging and non-imaging geospatial and meteorological data into a single source. The merging of satellite-based geospatial data with airborne-geospatial data, a challenging task, will improve the accuracy of earth science data. Potential applications of the technology include medium- to long-term food security planning, drought mitigation, soil conservation, diversification, and expansion of climate-resilient and sustainable farming.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project focuses on developing an integrated, one-source, dynamic geospatial database as well as precision soil moisture and farm productivity forecasting models to benefit small- and medium-size farms. The data inputs include (i) global navigation satellite system observations on a newly designed geodetic/meteorological network for significantly increased accuracy; (ii) airborne digital geospatial data from a fixed-wing platform to capture high precision and resolution nadir multispectral and color oblique imageries, lidar point cloud data, and data from un-manned aerial systems to capture seasonal hyperspectral imageries; (iii) satellite remote sensing data from commercial satellite high-resolution imageries; (iv) weather satellite data for hourly global precipitation measurements (GPM) fused with multi-satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement mission (GPM); and (v) terrestrial data from existing geographic information systems and meteorological stations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
