 "awd_abstract_narration": "Federally funded scientific cyberinfrastructure (CI) has accelerated ground-breaking scientific discoveries, including black hole imaging, genome sequencing, vaccine discovery, and more. However, the open-source software (OSS) technologies that help facilitate these discoveries often contain thousands of vulnerabilities that, if exploited, could threaten irreplaceable scientific analysis. Since scientific CIs often lack the personnel to manage these vulnerabilities, they increasingly outsource their vulnerability management tasks to third-party Research & Education security providers such as OmniSOC. However, security analysts at these providers often face challenges managing the tens of thousands of vulnerabilities present in OSS assets at CIs. This project scans thousands of scientific CI OSS assets for vulnerabilities and employs novel Artificial Intelligence-enabled analytics to (1) manage OSS asset vulnerabilities in scientific CI and (2) link them to their remediation strategies. Vulnerability scan and analytics results are integrated into a novel Vulnerability Management System that allows security analysts search, sort, browse, and collaborate on vulnerability data and remediation strategies across scientific CIs.\r\n\r\nThis project designs a novel Artificial Intelligence-enabled AZSecure Usable and Collaborative Security for Science Framework that scans for vulnerabilities in four major categories of open-source software (OSS) assets (virtual machines, containers, infrastructure-as-code, and GitHub) across two major NSF-funded scientific cyberinfrastructures (CIs): (1) CyVerse for life sciences and (2) Jetstream, NSF\u2019s first Science and Engineering Cloud for NSF and NIH. The vulnerability scans support three sets of AI-enabled analytics research thrusts to enhance the usability of vulnerability scan results for OmniSOC\u2019s security analysts. The first thrust aggregates OSS asset and vulnerability data into an embedding for vulnerability management tasks through multi-view learning incorporating a vulnerability severity weighting scheme and a novel combinatorial attention mechanism. The second thrust uses self-supervised learning and transformers to link vulnerability scans with remediation strategies by stacking multiple word embeddings and aligning vulnerability severity scores with a novel contrastive loss function. The final thrust develops a Vulnerability Management System that integrates scan results and enables analysts to operate the methods. Project execution includes roles for NSF CyberCorps Scholarship-for-Service graduate students from UArizona (NSA/DHS CD-, R, and CO-designated) and IU (NSA/DHS CD- and- R-designated). Findings are disseminated through academic and industry publications and integrated into the top-ranked MS in Cybersecurity programs at UArizona and IU.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
