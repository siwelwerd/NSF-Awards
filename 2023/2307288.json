 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary international scientific organization in the fields of computational linguistics, natural language processing, and human language technologies. The proceedings of the ACL's annual meeting provide the foundation of the field; it is the most cited and most respected publication in computational linguistics. Thus, it is also the most important gathering of researchers in computational linguistics and natural language processing, and represents one of the most important opportunities for young researchers to understand the field, build professional connections, and gain exposure. ACL has a long history of supporting these formative activities by holding a student research workshop. The workshops have proven popular: attracting dozens of submissions from highly qualified applicants.\r\n\r\nThe student research workshop will be a part of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), to be held in conjunction with the main conference July 9th - July 14th, 2023 in Toronto, Canada. The workshop will subsidize travel and conference registration for students who are selected to participate. The workshop will solicit submissions in two categories: 1) thesis proposals, for advanced students who have decided on a thesis topic and wish to get feedback on their proposal and broader ideas for their continuing work; 2) research papers, which can describe completed work, or work in progress with preliminary results. Each accepted paper will be assigned a mentor who will meet with the student during the ACL conference and provide individual feedback.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
