 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecosystems of the Southwest U.S. are facing stress from rapid climate change and expanding wildfires. Current wildfire conditions are leading to widespread mortality events and ecosystem conversion. Areas of high climate vulnerability that have experienced wildfire are especially susceptible to undesirable ecological changes. This project addresses these challenges by creating a Fire-Climate Response Early Warning (F-CREW) network. F-CREW is a collaboration of ecologists, land managers, and rural and Indigenous community members who will develop the foundation for a robust research program linking climate change, wildfire, and risk. The overarching goal of F-CREW is to contribute to the sustainability of both ecosystems and human communities during rapid change. These research frameworks can address fundamental gaps in our understanding of both ecological and social systems.\r\n\r\nThis planning Project has two objectives: (1) Identify areas of highest vulnerability to rapid ecological change, and (2) Engage with diverse communities affected by rapid ecological change. Through data synthesis and review, combined with spatial analysis, a mechanistic framework is developed to identify communities and places that are vulnerable to fire-mediated changes. The F-CREW team also engages with fire- and climate-vulnerable communities through local institutions, regional forums, and policy networks. A series of collaborative workshops and site visits develops appropriate community management protocols. Ultimately, the project addresses fundamental questions such as: (1) which areas are most vulnerable to rapid ecological change, and (2) what factors contribute to that vulnerability? The project clarifies the particular role of wildfire in determining rapid structural change in ecosystems of the Southwest U.S.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
