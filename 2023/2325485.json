Attending MobiSys is of paramount importance for students pursuing research in this field. Authors will have the opportunity to present their work and all attendees have a chance to interact with other researchers who perform leading-edge research in this domain. The goal of this student travel support is to widen the student audience, raise the level of interaction and the potential for new research collaborations, and support students who are not well-funded or under-represented.  \r\n \r\nThis project provides travel support to approximately 10\u201312 students from U.S. institutions of higher education. By enabling students (who might not otherwise be able) to attend the conference, this project increases the dissemination of the conference\u2019s research results to a larger and more diverse audience. It also integrates research and education of students by enabling students to observe high-quality presentations and interact with other researchers. By giving consideration in granting awards to women and minority students, it widens the participation among underrepresented groups. Furthermore, by advertising the opportunity among a wide range of colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of institutions would be able to attend and benefit from the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
