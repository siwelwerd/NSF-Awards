 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is focused on a microscale power supply that combines environmentally friendly materials to generate electrical current to power portable electronics such as cell phones, laptops, and mobile chargers. Drawing upon NSF-funded research in compact microfluidic systems that integrate biological cells with microchips, this project will explore the feasibility of establishing a small business venture to manufacture and sell the proposed power supply as a commercial product. At present, most of the small power supplies used in portable electronics contain exotic materials that are not environmentally friendly and can pose a public health risk when disposed of incorrectly. In addition, some of these materials are often in short supply which can impact the future design and manufacturing of portable electronics. The raw materials of the proposed power supply are environmentally friendly and abundant in nature.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a compact system that consist of three major elements: a single biological cell, small magnetic particles, and a custom-designed microchip. The manufacturing process of the system combines these elements in a unique sequence and manner, resulting in a compact power generator that converts the rotational power of the integrated cell into an electrical current in the microchip. Integration of the biological cell and the microchip at high precision is very challenging. While past work has demonstrated successful immobilization of biological materials on microchips, the integration process of the proposed power supply is unique because the integrated cell must rotate continuously after integration in order to generate an electrical current. Further, like all biological materials, the integrated cell will age within the system, and this can significantly limit the shelf life of the power supply. A key focus of the project is to evaluate the potential need of the proposed power supply by the commercial market while maintaining a proper balance between the cost and manufacturability of the system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
