 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of US-based researchers in the China-US Group Theory Summit 2024 to be held at University of Florida on Feb 22-25, 2024. Group theory is a branch of modern algebra studying the notion of symmetry. It is a fundamental and highly active field of research within the mathematical sciences and has ramifications throughout all of mathematics and the sciences. There are large communities of group theory researchers in all continents, and they keep in touch through international meetings and conferences. However, local conditions and cultural circumstances under which mathematical research is done differ quite a bit between different regions of the world. The focus of this conference is on research in group theory in the United States and in China. Building on the success of the first conference of this type held in 2019, the major goal of this conference is to strengthen ties between group theorists in China and the United States.\r\n \r\nThe conference will provide group theory researchers in China and the United States a forum to disseminate their own research as well as to learn about new and significant results in the area. It will help to bridge the gap between the group theory communities in the United States and China, and lead to future cooperation and collaborations. Speakers from both countries will cover a large variety of the subjects in the area, which include representations of solvable groups, representations of simple groups, character theory, classes of groups, groups and combinatorics, p-groups, and fusion systems. There will be about fourteen invited talks and a limited number of contributed talks. The conference will provide an inviting atmosphere to foster new collaborations; young researchers will have the opportunity to present their work and learn about the latest developments in the field. More information about the conference can be found at https://www.math.txst.edu/research-conferences/hosted-conferences/chinausgrouptheory24 and https://math.ufl.edu/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
