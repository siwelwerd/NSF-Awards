 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, result in lower workforce participation, which in turn can affect access to health care and health insurance.  Additionally, the rate of uninsured and underinsured residents in some regions is also significantly higher than in others.  This study investigates the impact of enhanced diabetes care for uninsured residents on workforce participation and economic outcomes as well as overall health outcomes.  This study provides critical insights into the impact of chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, on labor market outcomes and on strategies for improving diabetes care management.\r\n\r\nResearchers partners with community stakeholders to provide enhanced diabetes care to uninsured individuals through a lottery selection as part of a randomized control trial (RCT).  Individuals selected receive additional diabetes education, diabetic supplies, and care to help control diabetes and will be followed for a year to track outcomes.  Relevant health outcomes such as diabetic maintenance, amputations, morbidity, and mortality are measured in addition to economic indicators.  This study addresses questions regarding healthcare utilization, workforce participation, diabetes management, and other health and economic outcomes.  Ultimately, these results help to inform future programs and allocation of public health funds in relation to diabetes care, education, and healthcare resources to improve economic outcomes among underserved communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
