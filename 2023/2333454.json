 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a personal device that aims to improve respiratory health and promote nasal breathing. Currently, devices with analytical capabilities to accurately measure breathing patterns and CO2 levels are expensive and are only available in healthcare settings while personalized devices to improve respiratory are simple mechanical devices that do not monitor or track progress over time, nor provide training guidance with immediate feedback.  The proposed technology integrates advanced sensing technologies and smart algorithms for personalized training programs with immediate feedback.  This device may improve respiratory health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disorders, and systemic infections. The technology may have applications in areas such as sports performance, pulmonary rehabilitation, stress management, and general wellness, benefiting individuals of all age groups and lifestyles. In addition, this may empower users to monitor and track their progress over time, fostering a proactive approach to respiratory health management. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a respiratory device capable of measuring key respiratory and physiological parameters. Current devices lack comprehensive monitoring capabilities and are limited to oral breathing, disregarding the advantages of nasal breathing.  The proposed technology addresses these limitations as it allows monitoring of both nasal and oral breathing.   The proposed device consists of a face mask integrated with sensors and a smartphone app.  It integrates a flow sensor, a miniature infrared CO2 sensor, and electrodes for heart rate monitoring. Smart processing algorithms incorporating multiple breathing programs and recommendations will educate the user in how to improve their respiratory health, relax and improve overall well-being.  The research behind this project builds upon the established correlation between respiratory health and various health outcomes, such as life expectancy, sleep quality, and immune system strength. The technical results obtained from prototype testing demonstrate the feasibility and potential application in multiple domains, including disease prevention, fitness enhancement, stress management, and pulmonary illness recovery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
