 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need. Over its five-year duration, this project will award a total of 150 scholarships to support cohorts of 30 academically talented students each year, with a demonstrated financial need, who are pursuing degrees in computing at the California State University - San Bernardino. The goal of the project is to invigorate computing education in California's Inland Empire region by creating pathways to computing careers. The pedagogical changes to the introductory computing courses, supported by this award, will benefit more than 1,250 students.\r\n\r\nFour objectives will guide the project team. First is to increase the retention and graduation of low-income undergraduate students. Second is to transform the introduction to programming courses to include culturally responsive and active learning pedagogical techniques. Third is to develop a summer research program, and fourth is to expand and sustain a quarterly forum that brings together technology companies, policymakers, and thought leaders, enabling students to participate in local community-based experiential learning opportunities. The research component of the project will assess the impact of the scholarship program on low-income computing students' retention, academic success, and degree completion. Furthermore, it will explore how engaged learning and mentoring influence students' interest in pursuing research experiences and careers. This project is funded by NSF\u2019s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
