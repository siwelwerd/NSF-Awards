 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support travel for young US scientists to the \"Mathematical Relativity: Past, Present, Future\" workshop at the Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger International Institute (ESI), December 4-7, 2023, in Vienna, Austria. The goal of the workshop is to bring together advanced doctoral students, promising young researchers, and leading experts in the field to discuss the recent developments in the area, to share and discuss techniques that have proven particularly successful, to assess new areas of contact, and to support existing and promote new collaborations. This event will allow the participants to create a professional network, and this professional network promotes information sharing, collaboration, and career development while incubating meaningful contributions to the field. One third of the speakers at the conference are women. The committee which will choose the US participates is committed to choosing a diverse community of outstanding researchers in the field.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will focus on several major recent breakthroughs in mathematical general relativity, including the long-awaited proof of the stability of the Kerr solution for small angular momenta, new initial data gluing methods and proofs of the positive energy theorem, as well as insights to canonical structures of initial data for Einstein\u2019s equations (with or without coupling to matter fields). The workshop will gather young researchers along with leaders in the field of mathematical relativity. The workshop honors the 100th birthday of Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat, one of the outstanding pioneers of the field of mathematical relativity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
