 "awd_abstract_narration": "Symbiosis has repeatedly given rise to evolutionary innovation across the tree of life. Apicomplexans, including the causative agent of malaria, are the deadliest protozoan parasites on the planet. However, one lineage of apicomplexans (the genus Nephromyces), have evolved a symbiotic relationship with bacterial endosymbionts that has not only enabled an escape from a parasitic lifestyle, but caused a large radiation of species. This project aims to both characterize the diversity of these species and understand the interactions between host and symbiont that turned a parasite into a harmless inhabitant. This work will benefit society by advancing understanding of the diversity and contribution of eukaryotic microorganisms to the biosphere, with results that will be disseminated through peer-reviewed literature and presentations for scientific and lay audiences. The research will also be communicated to a broader audience through a workshop for professional scientific journalists. In addition, research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students will train the next generation of integrative systematic biologists.\r\n\r\nThis PurSUiT project will untangle the various biological entities that make up the Nephromyces community, across six species of tunicate hosts. Next-generation DNA sequencing will be used to determine the diversity of the community, then employ single cell isolation techniques to capture, image and describe individual Nephromyces species and their bacterial endosymbionts. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization labels, the different life stages of each species will be collected and photo-documented for the full life history. At least ten Nephromyces species from each of the six tunicate species will be formally named, as well as their bacterial endosymbionts to the extent possible under the evolving prokaryotic Code of Nomenclature. From existing genomic data, cutting edge techniques will be employed to determine whether genes have been laterally transferred from endosymbiont to host.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
