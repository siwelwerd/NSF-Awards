 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project lies in its direct impact on hands-on skills training for the use of power tools in the manufacturing industry. By bridging the gap between scientific research and practical application, the project aims to translate cutting-edge scientific discoveries into tangible solutions that address real-world challenges in manufacturing skills training.  Our partnership with industry and commercialization experts in the manufacturing sector will result in increased productivity, accessible tools, and reduced costs, bridging the skills gap faced in the manufacturing industry.  This partnership aims to target, recruit, and train individuals who can contribute to entrepreneurial education in high technology applications of virtual reality in the manufacturing workforce. To ensure a sustainable pipeline of skilled individuals, the project will collaborate with the K-12 education resources institute, women, and minority engineering program. We will not only enhance our understanding of how virtual skills training can be practically implemented but also have the potential to revolutionize industries and improve lives by scaling hands-on skills training. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project aims to create effective learning environments utilizing haptics and artificial intelligence (AI) in virtual reality (VR) to replicate physical reality to address the pervasive skills training gap in the manufacturing industry. The focus is on developing an immersive learning environment that facilitates the development of muscle memory and reduces the learning curve for using tools in real-life situations. To make the system more accessible to end-users, a low-code no-code authoring process will be developed.  The research will involve capturing the movement patterns of both users and experts in 3D, providing valuable feedback to enhance their skills. Feedback modalities such as haptic, visual, and auditory cues will be developed to reduce cognitive load, measure progress, and enhance the fidelity and value of the hands-on PowVRtool training experience.  A generalized haptic device, capable of rendering realistic feedback for various power tools, will be developed and tested. This will be achieved by utilizing machine learning algorithms that replicate the vibrations of real hand tools within a virtual environment. Through these efforts, the project anticipates technical results that will improve training experiences, increase skill acquisition, and enhance the effectiveness of hands-on power tool training in virtual environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
