 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE). The Department of Sociology at Texas A&M University will immerse 8 students each year in an 8-week summer social science research experience. The site will recruit undergraduates from groups underrepresented in STEM. Participants will conduct research with faculty at Texas A&M, joining a faculty mentor's ongoing research program. The primary objectives of the program are to: (1) increase the social science research opportunities available to undergraduates from underrepresented groups; (2) prepare a future workforce to engage in sophisticated evidence-based analyses of social inequality; (3) increase the scientific literacy of participants; and (4) prepare students for academic or non-academic careers with a research focus through both education and intensive mentoring. The intended impact is to increase students' understanding of research and increase the number of students from underrepresented groups pursuing graduate education and professional careers in science. Providing students with hands-on experience in research, intensive mentoring, and research skills, the benefit to society is to expand the pipeline of underrepresented groups into advanced social science research and increase the ability of participants to conduct independent research. \r\n\r\nThe most important intellectual merit of the program rests not on the students' individual contributions to social science knowledge in one summer, but on increasing the pipeline of talented students with meaningful social science research experiences and interest in research. Activities for each REU participant include: participating in a summer research seminar that will focus on practical instruction in social science theory, methods, and practices; learning about graduate educational opportunities and careers in science; completing a research project with a faculty mentor; writing a research paper; and presenting their research findings at a professional academic conference. This REU program is designed to interest students from underrepresented groups in the possibility of research-based careers and prepare them with the skills necessary to succeed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
