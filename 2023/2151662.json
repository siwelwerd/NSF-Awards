 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to accelerate the transition from chemical pesticides to non-chemical alternatives by providing farmers with a sustainable, long-term solution for managing pests, while reducing agricultural impacts on human health and the environment. Today, strawberry farmers are reliant on chemical pesticides, spending $2,500/acre on over 60,000 acres/year to support the $3.6 billion U.S. strawberry industry. Organic farms, representing 10% of the industry, lack effective treatment methods resulting in high labor costs and increased risk of yield loss. This project seeks to develop a system for using ultraviolet light as an efficient and equally effective alternative for chemical pesticides, disrupting the pesticide manufacturing industry by providing farmers with a healthier and more environmentally conscious method for treating crops. The solution may eliminate uncertainty associated with chemical applications, reduce labor requirements, and increase profitability for farmers. Additionally, technologies developed as part of this project will minimize human exposure to chemical pesticides and reduce the ecological damage caused by existing agricultural treatment practices.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop a novel, non-chemical treatment system for commercialization of agricultural pest control. This system will provide a cost competitive alternative to chemical pesticides, a global $84 billion market. Existing pest controls are ineffective due to insect resistance, cause uncertainty, and result in reduced yield and profitability. This project\u2019s objective is to create a reliable, non-chemical treatment alternative that uses ultraviolet (UV-C) light to control multiple pests effectively and sustainably. The project team will build a UV-C treatment device with a dosing control algorithm for achieving reliable pest control in minimum treatment time. This dosing controller will use novel volumetric irradiance profiles to characterize the effectiveness of a treatment and adjust treatment time and/or distance to account for field uncertainties. The goal of this research is be a commercial UV-C treatment system integrated into an automated pest control system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
