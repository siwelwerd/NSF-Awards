 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V Blue Heron, an 86-foot Coastal research vessel owned by the University of Minnesota and operated by the Large Lakes Observatory as part of the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF). Built in 1985 for fishing on the Grand Banks, the Blue Heron was purchased by the University of Minnesota in 1997. The vessel is outfitted with state-of-the-art research equipment, has berthing for 11 crew and scientists, and can operate 24 hours per day for up to 21 days in between port calls. The Blue Heron is part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) and is available for charter by research scientists on any of the Great Lakes. In 2022, the vessel completed 110 funded days, 45 of these (41%) were for NSF. In 2023, the vessel is scheduled for 55 days, 36 of which (65%) will be for NSF.\r\n\r\nOceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:\r\n\r\nSediment Trap\t$30,730\r\nFluorometers for CTD and underway system\t$50,815\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$81,545\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe RV Blue Heron is a research vessel owned and operated by the University of Minnesota that assists researchers and educators in their work on all of the North American Great Lakes. The University of Minnesota purchased a sediment trap for the RV Blue Herons scientific mooring operations, six fluorometers for the vessels underwater and underway sensor systems, and upgraded the ships McLane in-situ water sampling instrument using funds provided by the National Science Foundation award OCE#2313788 OI 2023 UMD R/V Blue Heron Oceanographic Instrumentation. The sediment trap, six fluorometers, and in-situ water sampler will allow the vessel to better serve the researchers and educators who use the vessel.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nRV Blue Heron deploys scientific mooring throughout the Great Lakes and these scientific moorings often include sediment traps as one of the scientific instruments attached to the mooring. We lost a sediment trap on Lake Erie due to a quagga mussel infestation and this grant allowed us to replace the sediment trap. Additionally, the fluorometers that are a part of our underwater and underway sensor systems were obsolete and no longer serviced by the manufacturer. This grant allowed us to replace the sensors with new sensors. Finally, one of our in-situ pumps, an instrument that we lower into the water and have it filter large volumes of lake water past filters which are analyzed later by scientists, was damaged and funds from this grant allowed us to upgrade and refurbished the pump.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe new equipment is available to all users of R/V Blue Heron, including the National Science Foundation funded project that is using the vessel in 2025. Besides the NSF funded project, we are supporting several other science projects in 2025: a cruise funded by the Legislative-Citizens Commission on Minnesota Resources, several Sea Grant cruises, a State of Minnesota Department of Natural Resources cruise, a cruise funded by National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, several cruises funded by Princeton University and multiple research and educational cruises funded by the University of Minnesota. Regarding the educational cruises, the University of Minnesota is funding eight cruises in 2025 which will expose close to 200 undergraduates to scientific research on the Great Lakes.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/05/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RichardDRicketts\n"
