 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the development of a novel, and more benign than fiberglass, thermal insulation technology for use in homes across the United States. Improvements in insulation technology have the potential to reduce energy use nationwide, along with all carbon emissions associated with the production and transmission of that energy. According to the Energy Information Administration, 51% of all residential energy in the United States is used for heating and cooling living spaces, which amounts to about 11% of the total energy consumption of the country. This project aims to use the principles of biomimicry to develop a more effective batt insulation. Unlike other insulation materials, unprotected exposure by the insultation installers will not aggravate respiratory issues, which is increasingly important for homeowners and working people who suffer from the long-term effects of COVID-19. This project seeks to push the potential and affordability of this new technology while creating new American jobs. \r\n\r\nThe project is inspired by the nests of yellowjacket wasps that live in pockets of permafrost high above the Arctic circle. The nests are protected from extreme temperatures by the hollow wall structure surrounding the nest\u2019s interior. This structure can be adapted to create insulation panels that are highly efficient, lightweight, water-resistant, non-combustible, non-toxic, non-dusting, and irritant-free. The project focuses on the development of such a thermal insulation material in an efficient way to keep its price point competitive with the current products. This involves designing a manufacturing machine capable of producing the new insulation quickly and consistently. To further push the thermal performance of the material, the company will also develop a complementary machine that can scan insect specimens in museum collections to assess biological structures that are highly reflective in infrared wavelengths and use the data to address management of radiative heat transfer. The team will apply a six-sigma approach to quality control for improving the insulation manufacturing process.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We called our product &ldquo;YellowJacket&trade; insulation&rdquo; after the wasps that inspired it. The purpose of this SBIR Phase I project was to (1) develop YellowJacket&trade; into a commercially viable product, and (2) develop automated machinery to manufacture batts of YellowJacket&trade; insulation at scale. We believe that YellowJacket&trade; has the potential to revolutionize the insulation industry, and customers are already lining up to be early adopters as soon as the product is commercially available.</p>\r\n<p>The industry standards for thermal building insulation are fiberglass and spray foam (comprising about 71% and 11% of the commercial market, respectively). Despite their widespread use, these materials are notorious for their harmful effects on human and environmental health. Consumers are actively searching for a better option, but &ndash; thus far &ndash; no other product has successfully met that market need.</p>\r\n<p>The energy efficiency of an insulation material is proportional to its thermal resistivity, which is measured as its &ldquo;R-value&rdquo; per unit thickness (written &ldquo;R/in&rdquo;). A higher R-value means the material is better at resisting the flow of heat. Our team assembled and tested over two dozen unique YellowJacket&trade; prototypes using a custom-built testing machine. Each prototype sought to quantify the thermal effects of a different variable &ndash; such as air pocket size, structural material, and reflective coating. We sent several prototypes to an ASTM certification laboratory for independent validation. They were able to verify our best prototype at 4.81 R/in, which is over 40% more energy-efficient than the median batt of commercial fiberglass.</p>\r\n<p>We began this Phase I project with the assumption that thermal resistivity was the single most important metric for homeowners when choosing a new type of insulation. However, Beat-the-Odds customer interviews revealed that homeowners consistently rate human health, environmental health, and ease of installation as significantly more important than thermal resistivity. Fortunately for us, YellowJacket&trade; insulation already matches or exceeds industry alternatives in each of these metrics. YellowJacket&trade; is American-made, non-toxic, non-dusting, irritant-free, moisture-resistant, non-combustible, energy-efficient, cost-competitive, and made from recycled materials. It is safe to handle (with or without PPE) and poses no risk to human health.</p>\r\n<p>Halfway through the Phase I project, we identified a potential combustibility issue with one of our raw materials. Fortunately, we were able to develop a new self-extinguishing and inexpensive composite material (which we named &ldquo;ChipAL&rdquo;) to replace it. When exposed to the open flame of a propane torch, ChipAL forms a passive mechanical \"blister\" that stifles ignition and prevents further combustion.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, though we tried to plan ahead by designing our automated machinery to manufacture YellowJacket&trade; batts with a wide range of external dimensions, we did not account for a radically different feedstock. The current machine designs are incompatible with our new ChipAL composite and must be redesigned from the ground up. Fortunately, almost all of the components can be salvaged and reused in the next iteration of the machines (which we hope to design and build in Phase II).</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, this Phase I project sought to study biological specimens in infrared (IR) light for the purposes of biomimicry research. In theory, it may be possible to design better radiant heat barriers for buildings if we can identify biological materials that are highly reflective in IR wavelengths. Most of Earth&rsquo;s biodiversity has never been studied in detail outside of the visible spectrum, so this type of research presents an incredible opportunity for new scientific discoveries.</p>\r\n<p>Among the biological samples we tested, we found that the leaves of Southern Magnolia (<em>Magnolia grandiflora</em>) and the integument of many beetles in the superfamily Scarabaeoidea (including <em>Chalcosoma atlas</em>) exhibit the highest IR reflectivity. Nonetheless, their properties do not exceed the performance of commercial heat barrier materials. It is entirely possible that better biological materials exist, but were not able to find them in Phase I.</p>\r\n<p>In summary, the Owlfly team is highly motivated to improve the long-term well-being of the people in our communities. We believe in the power of conscientious engineering to improve quality of life without sacrificing human health, and we believe that YellowJacket&trade; insulation is a great commercial opportunity to do just that.</p>\r\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://www.owlflyllc.com/yellowjacket\">https://www.owlflyllc.com/yellowjacket</a> for more information.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/13/2025<br>\nModified by: Chris&nbsp;Alice&nbsp;Kratzer</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2232908/2232908_10864872_1739491171613_Owlfly_LLC_YellowJacket_Specs_2025_small--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2232908/2232908_10864872_1739491171613_Owlfly_LLC_YellowJacket_Specs_2025_small--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"YellowJacket Specifications 2025\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2232908/2232908_10864872_1739491171613_Owlfly_LLC_YellowJacket_Specs_2025_small--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"YellowJacket Specifications 2025\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A chart that compares YellowJacket insulation to fiberglass and spray foam based on the best available information.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Owlfly LLC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chris&nbsp;Alice&nbsp;Kratzer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">YellowJacket Specifications 2025</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2232908/2232908_10864872_1739491138980_Owlfly_LLC_YellowJacket_Prototype_small--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2232908/2232908_10864872_1739491138980_Owlfly_LLC_YellowJacket_Prototype_small--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"YellowJacket Prototype\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2232908/2232908_10864872_1739491138980_Owlfly_LLC_YellowJacket_Prototype_small--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"YellowJacket Prototype\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Our Laboratory Technician holds up one of our most recent ChipAL-based YellowJacket prototypes.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Owlfly LLC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chris&nbsp;Alice&nbsp;Kratzer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">YellowJacket Prototype</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2232908/2232908_10864872_1739491209495_Owlfly_LLC_HTTR_Machine_small--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2232908/2232908_10864872_1739491209495_Owlfly_LLC_HTTR_Machine_small--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The Inner Chamber of the HTTR (Heat Transfer Test Rig)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2232908/2232908_10864872_1739491209495_Owlfly_LLC_HTTR_Machine_small--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The Inner Chamber of the HTTR (Heat Transfer Test Rig)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The HTTR was used to test the thermal properties of YellowJacket prototypes.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Owlfly LLC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chris&nbsp;Alice&nbsp;Kratzer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">The Inner Chamber of the HTTR (Heat Transfer Test Rig)</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2232908/2232908_10864872_1739491388612_Owllfy_LLC_IRIS_Reaearch_small--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2232908/2232908_10864872_1739491388612_Owllfy_LLC_IRIS_Reaearch_small--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Infrared Testing on Biological Specimens\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2232908/2232908_10864872_1739491388612_Owllfy_LLC_IRIS_Reaearch_small--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Infrared Testing on Biological Specimens\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two insect specimens from the CUIC (Phymateus viridipes and Papilio arcturus) photographed using the IRIS under visible and IR light.
