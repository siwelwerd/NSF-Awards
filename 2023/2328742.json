 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to use innovative materials called \u201c2D materials\u201d to enhance the capabilities of modern integrated circuits. These materials have unique electronic properties that make them very promising for compute, storage, and sensing technologies. However, integrating them with existing silicon-based technology has been a challenge due to temperature restrictions. Luckily, a new group of materials called \u201cindium-based chalcogenides\u201d offers a solution, as they can be synthesized at low temperatures compatible with current technology. The project team plans to create a range of devices using these materials to accelerate the performance of energy-efficient spiking neural networks (SNNs). These brain-inspired microchips will revolutionize how audio, visual, tactile, and olfactory information is processed, making devices smarter and more responsive. Moreover, these microchips could be used in autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots, helping them navigate and avoid obstacles. The project also focuses on training the next generation of scientists and engineers and promoting diversity and inclusivity in the field.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to address the challenge of integrating novel 2D materials with the state-of-the-art silicon-based complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology at the back end of line (BEOL). The key innovation lies in leveraging indium-based chalcogenides, such as InSe and In2Se3, which can be synthesized at low temperatures, making them compatible with BEOL processes. The team plans to synthesize and characterize these materials to fabricate an array of sensing, encoding, computing, and memory devices for hardware acceleration of energy-efficient spiking neural networks (SNNs). The project will involve a cross-layer co-optimization approach that encompasses material discovery, synthesis and deposition techniques, process flow development, and device-circuit-architecture co-design. The goal is to develop brain-inspired SNN microchips through 2D/CMOS heterogeneous and monolithic integration, which will lead to substantial reductions in energy consumption and pave the way for sustainable computing paradigms. The broader impact of this work extends to applications on the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, where the brain-mimetic SNN microchips will enable advanced audio, visual, tactile, and olfactory information processing. Additionally, the project emphasizes education and training, promoting diversity and inclusiveness in the workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
