 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by gaining insights on the use of Undergraduate Research Experiences (UREs) at Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) as a means of creating inclusive learning environments in order to increase student retention, persistence, and success. In an effort to be truly Hispanic serving, evidence-based practices can be employed to reduce inequities in STEM education to increase academic outcomes for all students. Undergraduate research has been shown to be a high impact practice (HIP) that is useful in developing students\u2019 problem-solving skills, work habits, connecting their classroom experiences to the real world, and improving persistence with the benefit of helping students develop a \u201cscience identity.\u201d  In particular, evidence has established that undergraduate research experiences are known to significantly increase the number of underrepresented students persisting and graduating in STEM. The workshop plans to convene community college faculty from HSIs, undergraduate research organizations, professional societies, and various stakeholders who are experts in undergraduate research from across the Nation.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will convene HSI community college faculty and professional organization leaders to share their successes and challenges to achieve these main goals: (1) Promote inclusive learning environments to increase student retention, persistence and success in STEM through the high impact practice of undergraduate research experiences at HSI community colleges, and: (2) Provide a space for discourse on undergraduate research experiences by catering to the unique needs of the HSI community colleges. The workshop will enable thought leaders to give their insights through a think tank approach. The participants will be provided opportunities to discuss themes such as: equitable access to UREs for all students, scaling and sustaining UREs at HSI community colleges, measuring impacts on student learning and assessing the cultural value of the student experiences, and networks and partnerships. During each of the sessions, the discussions will focus on the aforementioned themes at the level of the institution, classroom (faculty), students, and professional societies. Expected outcomes from the workshop will (1) Determine the unique needs of the diverse student population among the diverse HSI institution types for adoption and implementation of the UREs for equitable access to UREs for all students; (2) Identify the opportunities and barriers for the adoption, scaling and sustaining UREs in the STEM fields at the level of the institution, faculty/classrooms, students, and professional societies. A white paper will be composed, based on the conference activities, outlining the unique needs of STEM students at HSI institutions along with identifying potential barriers to providing equitable access for students. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
