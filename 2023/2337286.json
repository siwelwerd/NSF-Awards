 "awd_abstract_narration": "Workshop to Grow Aspiring PIs in the Computer and Information Sciences in Alaska and Neighboring Regions: This one-day workshop will bring together researchers in Alaska and adjacent regions to grow aspiring PIs in Computing and Information Science and Engineering (CISE). The long-term goal is to grow core CISE research from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). This will broaden research participation and ultimately produce stronger research by bringing together different perspectives that can spark innovation, is more generalizable and inclusive with respect to society, and helps grow the field in terms of research products and the pipeline of students from undergraduate to graduate programs to industry.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will be held in Anchorage, Alaska in early 2024, by invitation only with approximately 40 participants. About 1/3 of the participants will consist of senior researchers who will help mentor the aspiring PIs. The workshop\u2019s objective is to train and mentor the aspiring PIs about NSF\u2019s Computer and Information Science and Engineering Minority-Serving Institution (CISE-MSI) program, how to submit a competitive proposal, and begin the planning process to submit a proposal.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
