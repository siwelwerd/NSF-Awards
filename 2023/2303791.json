 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to complete the development of \"The Phoenix\", a zero-fuel furnace that converts trash to ash and energy with 30% less greenhouse gas emissions per ton than landfills or conventional incineration. This technology enables municipal solid waste to be managed in a decentralized manner, avoiding the expense and negative environmental impacts of long-distance transportation. The zero-fuel Phoenix is very cost effective as the only inputs are water, filtration media, and labor to operate the machine. Amortizing the cost of the machine over 4 years, waste disposal cost is estimated at $20/ton which is half the cost of the cheapest landfill tipping fees in the US. Heat from the water scrubber can be utilized to generate 106.7 KWe of electricity, with a potential 5 to 10-fold increase if utilizing direct heat from the furnace. The ash byproduct has beneficial reuse as a construction material or soil amendment. Glass and metal are not destroyed by the process and can be retrieved from the ash chamber for recycling, reducing the costly process of separation. These circular economy benefits help increase the economic competitiveness of the U.S. recycling and waste management industry. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project focuses on the commercial application of low temperature plasma to enhance thermal degradation of municipal solid waste in a clean and highly cost-effective manner. The technology would complete the development of a patent-pending mobile waste disposal, low-temperature plasma furnace with electricity cogeneration while avoiding the generation of numerous toxic compounds, including dioxins and furans traditionally associated with conventional incinerators. An ion generator utilizes proprietary technology to break down the oxygen molecule into two oxygen atoms and thereby limiting the generation of complex pollutants. However, this process may still form carbon monoxide. The Phoenix system uses a catalytic process to convert carbon monoxide, CO, to carbon dioxide, CO2, at low temperature. The Phase II project will primarily continue to improve the emissions quality of multiple feedstocks with a focus on plastics.  The team will also select the most efficacious and cost-effective catalyst for CO conversion and perform extended testing to evaluate long-term operations of the unit.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
