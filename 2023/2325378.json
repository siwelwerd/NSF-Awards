 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support to students from US institutions to participate in the Doctoral Consortium at the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) in Vancouver, Canada, from June 18 to 22, 2023. The CVPR is the premier annual conference that attracts over 10,000 participants from all over the world and is widely considered the leading conference in computer vision. The Doctoral Consortium is designed specifically for Ph.D. students who are nearing graduation or who have recently graduated, offering them an opportunity to present their research and receive valuable feedback from experienced faculty and senior researchers. It is an ideal platform for discussions on research and professional development, networking, and career advancement. It aims to promote the development of students in STEM and increase the number of researchers and educators in the field. Furthermore, it plays a significant role in advancing the field of computer vision and addressing critical problems that have the potential to benefit society as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide group travel grants to support a diverse group of approximately 25 students from US-based institutions, including those from underrepresented groups and institutions and those who may not otherwise have the means to attend the conference. The selection of participants and travel support recipients will be determined by the 2023 CVPR Doctoral Consortium chairs. The travel award will cover partial conference-related expenses such as airfare, lodging, and transportation. The Doctoral Consortium will include a poster session, interaction discussions, and small group mentoring. It will be held in a hybrid mode to enable students and mentors with varying needs to participate. The event will be diverse in terms of gender, ethnic background, academic institution, and geographic location.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
