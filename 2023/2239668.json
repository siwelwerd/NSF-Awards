 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glaciers are created from annual snowfall which does not entirely melt during summer months.  Over time, this accumulated snow condenses to form glacier ice. Firn is a highly porous middle stage between snow and ice which often stores surface meltwater in its pore space.  Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have a good estimate of how much meltwater is stored in firn, how this water storage varies from glacier to glacier, or how this storage amount is changing due to climate change.  This project will determine several firn properties such as firn thicknesses, pore volume, water storage, and changes in water storage over time across the Juneau Icefield located in Southeast Alaska. We will use field observations and modeling to answer these questions and to estimate firn properties more broadly across Alaska and Canada.  This is important because Alaska and Canada glaciers are retreating (melting) faster than any other glacier system on Earth. Therefore, we expect changes in meltwater storage to occur.  Meltwater stored in firn has the potential to raise sea level by a significant amount and impact other Earth systems such as ocean microscopic life forms and fisheries if it is rapidly released from glaciers.  We will use results from this project in an interactive educational video game we build for classrooms and the Mendenhall Glacier Visitors Center which receives over 600,000 visitors per year. We will train hundreds of students to use the game and help with further game development.  Lastly, this project will partially support an annual Culture Camp with indigenous communities in Alaska and Northwestern Canada where strategies for reducing impacts from environmental changes will be developed.\r\n\r\nThis project will quantify spatial and temporal variations in firn thickness, density, porosity, water content, and volume change, across the Juneau Icefield (JIF) in Southeast Alaska and Northwest Canada. We will use a range of observations acquired during this project, previously acquired data, data assimilation, and modeling, to understand the impacts of firn volume change on meltwater storage, meltwater flux, and down-glacier impacts from changing meltwater processes. We have selected the JIF for this study because it is an appropriate analog to thousands of temperate glaciers across the globe experiencing firn loss and thinning.  This research will characterize spatial and temporal variability of meltwater and meltwater movement within firn over hourly-to-yearly timescales and cm-to-km spatial scales, resolutions rarely achieved across any glacier system. Temperate firn is poorly constrained and densification models of firn do not yet incorporate empirical observations of melt. Additionally, spatial data on firn thickness, changes to firn volume due to glacier retreat, and the associated changes to firn meltwater storage and down-glacier meltwater flux (thereby influencing down-glacier ecosystems), are largely unknown. This proposal will help tackle these challenges. This is important because Alaskan and Canadian glaciers are retreating faster than any other glacier system on Earth, so we expect changes in firn meltwater storage to occur.  Meltwater stored in firn has the potential to raise sea level by a significant amount and impact down-glacier terrestrial and marine ecosystems due to climate change. As part of this project, we will build an interactive educational video game for use in classrooms and the Mendenhall Glacier Visitors Center (>600,000 annual visitors). We will also train over 500 students to use the game and help with further game development.  Lastly, this project will partially support an annual Culture Camp with indigenous communities in Alaska and Northwestern Canada to brainstorm collaborative strategies for reducing impacts from environmental changes being observed in these regions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
