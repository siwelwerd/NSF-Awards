 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will help support the participation of US-based students in the Summer School: Inclusive Paths in Explicit Number Theory, scheduled for July 2--15, 2023, at the Banff International Research Station satellite site at the University of British Columbia-Okanagan in Kelowna, Canada. A primary goal of the summer school is to train students on the most recent techniques in explicit number theory and to further advance the field. For the first time, leading experts in the field will come together to provide mentorship to a new generation of student researchers that is more representative of our diverse community. The first week of the summer school will consist of lectures and activities on key topics as well as professional development activities. In the second week, small groups of participants will work on cutting-edge research problems in a collaboration with senior and emerging researchers. It is hoped that the complementary expertise of group members will facilitate tackling research problems and lead to publishable state-of-the-art results. \r\n\r\nThe field of explicit number theory is one of the most exacting flavors of number theory, focusing on simple-to-state yet notoriously difficult problems such as the Goldbach conjecture (every even number greater than 2 be written as the sum of two primes) and the Legendre conjecture (there is a prime number between every two consecutive squares). Producing important results in explicit number theory requires both scientific creativity and meticulous precision. In the past decade, there has been a flurry of activity in the field with significant explicit results for many L-functions, established by researchers in North America, Europe, and Australia. The summer school website is: https://sites.google.com/view/crgl-functions/summer-school-inclusive-paths-in-explicit-number-theory\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
