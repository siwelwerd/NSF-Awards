 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a full satellite communication (satcom) terminal commonly known as VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) for fixed and mobile platforms such as residences, manned and unmanned aerial vehicles, and maritime crafts. This novel satellite communication antenna can be used for Low, Medium and Geosynchronous Earth Orbits (LEO/MEO/GEO). Inexpensive, rapid prototyping will promote the proliferation of satcom technology that will serve disadvantaged communities, low resourced businesses in remote areas, transportation-related industries, and national security.  \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop a satcom antenna technology. The technology pushes the technical limits of current satcom antenna technologies (\u2018dish\u2019 antenna and phased-array antenna also known as electronically steerable antenna, flat panel, and others). The technical capabilities metrics include an extremely high data bandwidth output that is 100 times current bandwidth and a data traffic speed that is 100-times that of current technologies for speed performance. In addition, this approach provides reliable, dependable connectivity with a view angle capability that covers a large spatial angle. The large view angle, used in radar applications, enables a unique tactical scanning advantage of the sky for defense operations and provides simultaneous engagement capability to several flying targets at once, i.e., Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) or drones. With a relatively small footprint compared to current antennas, this approach addresses several capability gaps encountered in the defense industry.  It also addresses internet connectivity/voice communication issues that have plagued extensive areas of the earth, making urban cable communication networks and moving platforms such as leisure and commercial air and maritime transportation more accessible.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
