 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funding for the next three iterations of the long-standing Wasatch Topology Conference, which will be held in October of 2023 at the University of Utah, and August of 2024 and 2025 in Park City, Utah. Each conference will be held over 2-3 days, and will include research talks by leading mathematicians in geometry, topology, and dynamics. The conferences will cover a broad range of topics, include a diverse list of speakers and participants, and highlight the work of early career mathematicians. The Wasatch Topology Conference will advance knowledge in the field by providing a venue for the transfer of knowledge from experts to a wider audience. Research opportunities are also created through interactions between all conference participants and graduate students via their lightning talks. \r\n\r\nConference topics include low dimensional topology, geometric topology, dynamics, and geometric group theory, and within these areas, cover the broadest range of subjects. There is a concerted effort on the organizers' part in recruiting mathematicians to discuss their research related to significant and groundbreaking results. These conferences will serve as a venue to highlight new and hot topics in the research areas. In addition, the organizers are fully committed to diversity and inclusion in the selection of speakers and participants. and are deeply committed to the future recruitment of individuals marginalized along different axes including, but not limited to, race, gender, age, disability status, and socioeconomic status. A diverse pool of speaker-participants and participants will help to continue to foster diversity and inclusion within this subfield of mathematics and help to retain early career mathematicians marginalized along similar and other axes. The website for the Wasatch Topology Conference is https://www.math.utah.edu/wtc/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
