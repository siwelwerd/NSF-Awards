 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel award supports the participation of junior and senior US researchers in the African School for Electronic Structure Methods and Applications (ASESMA) school and workshop, to be held in Rwanda in June 2023. The researchers will serve as both instructors and mentors, each teaching one lecture in the school and giving one research project presentation during the workshop. School attendees will be educated in fundamental and advanced aspects of electronic structure theory and its numerical frameworks. The school and the workshop will lay down the foundation for establishing long-lasting research collaborations between US and African scientists.  It will also provide junior US researchers with a valuable international teaching experience and allow them to interact closely with prominent senior scientists in electronic structure theory from around the world.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
