 "awd_abstract_narration": "The El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation is the largest source of climate fluctuation on seasonal to year-to-year time scales. It has immense societal impacts around the world. Most El Ni\u00f1o events tend to evolve throughout the seasons in similar ways: beginning around May or June, reaching their peak amplitude toward the end of the calendar year, and dying off through the following (northern) spring. Despite these similarities, individual El Ni\u00f1o events evolve in slightly different \u2013 but important \u2013 ways, leading to different levels of impacts. The role of seasonality in controlling how El Ni\u00f1o evolves is not yet well understood. This project examines the seasonal evolution of different types of El Ni\u00f1o events by developing and utilizing a suite of complimentary tools. The study includes the development of empirical models to ensure that analysis is grounded in observations, the usage of physics-based model simulations that allow systematic testing of specific physical processes, and the application of new analytical tools that link theoretical ideas of dynamical systems to applied analysis of specific features of El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s seasonal evolution. The study will advance understanding of why and how different seasonally varying processes lead to the seasonal evolution of individual El Ni\u00f1o events.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this study is threefold. First, the study will advance our understanding of how El Ni\u00f1o events develop to inform efforts to understand and predict El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s wide ranging societal impacts. Second, the study will continue the development of powerful new empirical models that can be applied to understand and predict other societally relevant phenomena in the Earth system. Lastly, the project will contribute to training the next generation of climate scientists, with opportunities to work with scientists in federal laboratories who are developing the underlying theories of empirical model development as well as application of those models to real physical problems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
