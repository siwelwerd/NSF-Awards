 "awd_abstract_narration": "Illinois is an agricultural state with related commodities generating billions of dollars annually. The economic plan of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) emphasizes investing in research and innovation as one of its guiding priorities, with a focus on agriculture and agri-business. STEM technicians trained in water quality analysis and who can provide vital information to Illinois farmers are in high demand, and this demand is expected to continue. A consequence of large-scale agricultural production, however, is field nutrient loss as rain carries fertilizer run-off into local waterways, contributing to hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. The NSF ATE project at Illinois Central College (ICC) is designed to grow the Illinois economy and workforce while addressing environmental and health concerns generated by farmland nutrient loss. This project will create a pipeline of STEM technicians to meet the demands of regional employers, as well as contribute to scientific research by generating data for the Illinois\u2019 Nutrient Loss Reduction Strategy (INLRS) to measure nitrogen and phosphorous field runoff. ICC\u2019s project will accomplish these goals by: 1) improving student proficiency in conducting scientific experimentation and increasing student awareness of STEM technician careers; and 2) generating and sharing scientific data and agricultural strategies to support conservation and water quality.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide students with hands-on experience in conducting scientific experimentation and will better prepare them to enter the STEM technician workforce via enhanced course curricula and work-based learning activities. Over three years, 55 students will successfully utilize instrumentation for water sample analysis with 20 of those students demonstrating increased awareness of the INLRS and the health and environmental impacts of nutrient loss. As part of the project, selected students will participate in internships with industry partners, and it is anticipated that a subset of students will secure employment in STEM technician jobs within six months of associate degree completion. Additionally, this project will increase awareness of STEM and agriculture education and career opportunities for students by: 1) engaging approximately 200 high school students and teachers annually through an Agricultural Showcase and Field Day; 2) delivering professional development to high school teachers and college faculty on STEM teaching-learning strategies; and 3) providing STEM-focused professional development to guidance counselors, advisors, and career counselors at ICC. External evaluators will assess student preparedness as entry-level STEM technicians as well as the scientific efficacy of specific agricultural conservation practices. Results and data from this project will be disseminated regionally through the Illinois Sustainable Ag Partnership, the Illinois Corn Growers Association, the INLRS, and will be presented at the Illinois Association of Vocational Agricultural Teachers conference. Project results will be nationally disseminated through the Community College Alliance for Agricultural Advancement and through NSF ATE conferences. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation\u2019s economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
