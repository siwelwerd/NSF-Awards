 "awd_abstract_narration": "Magnetic reconnection and the Kelvin-Helmhotz Instability (KHI) are believed to be the two major coupling mechanisms between the magnetosphere and the solar wind. This coupling enables energy and particle exchange between the two regions. This project studies these phenomena to provide insight into the importance of Earth\u2019s dipole as a function of time for plasma transport across the magnetopause, the Ionosphere dynamic, and its implications for understanding space weather. The broader impacts include support of a graduate student and the research is led by early career woman scientists.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on the dipole tilt effects on the KHI at the Earth\u2019s magnetopause boundary and the associated geomagnetic perturbations using both in situ and MHD simulation data. The following Science Questions are addressed: dipole tilt effects on KHI and its characteristics under different IMF and solar wind plasma conditions, and the dipole tilt effects on KHI-associated geomagnetic perturbations on the ground. A combination of observational data (statistical study) and modeling with Open Geospace General Circulation Model (OpenGGCM) will be used to address the dipole tilt effects on KHI and how that affects the geomagnetic perturbations excited by KHI on the ground. The project utilizes NSF funded ground-based data sets including magnetometer observations and SuperDARN radar.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
