 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) on R/V Atlantis, a 274\u2019 general purpose research vessel, and R/V Armstrong, a 238\u2019 multidisciplinary vessel. Both are operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) as part of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF) which is scheduled by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). Both are owned by the U.S. Navy, have state-of-the-art instrumentation, and support all disciplines of oceanographic research.  The vessels work in all the world\u2019s oceans supporting science funded primarily by U.S government agencies. R/V Atlantis is specifically outfitted for launching and servicing Alvin, the human occupied submersible as well as other vehicles of the National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF). \r\n\r\nWith this proposal, WHOI provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following SSSE:\r\n\t\t\r\n1)\tIsotope Van HVAC Unit - RV ATLANTIS\t$8,359\t\r\n2)\t-80'C Utility Chest Freezer - RV ARMSTRONG\t$7,415\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$15,774\t\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
