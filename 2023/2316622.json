 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jimmie Adriazola is awarded an NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to conduct a program of research and activities related to broaden participation by groups underrepresented in STEM.  This fellowship to Dr. Adriazola, supports his research project entitled \u201cPostdoctoral Fellowship: MPS-Ascend: Coherent Control of Nonlinear Schrodinger Dynamics in the Presence of Uncertainty\u201d under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host institution for the fellowship is Southern Methodist University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Alejandro Aceves.\r\n \r\nDr. Adriazola will study two projects with a common theme: understanding and controlling wave dynamics governed by nonlinear Schrodinger-type equations. The first of these projects involves optimal control theory applied to coherent manipulations of stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equations, and the second involves a study of field operators governed by a quantum nonlinear Schrodinger equation modeling propagation of quantized light.\r\n \r\nDr. Adriazola will be an active mentor to undergraduate and graduate students from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM, both through teaching and through involvement in the community.  He will participate in and learn from workshops and conferences focused in bringing diversity to the STEM community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
