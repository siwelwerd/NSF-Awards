 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers, businesses, and governments use a variety of technologies to quickly map the Internet and understand how it behaves. Exploring these behaviors lets us understand things such as how organizations and governments control what websites people globally can visit or how networks are attacked. Unfortunately, current technologies largely concentrate on how quickly and how much of the Internet can be explored, and it is very challenging to ensure our understanding is complete and correct. This project will create the next generation of Internet measurement technologies that will improve measurement correctness and completeness by better understanding the structure and connections of networks, temporary behaviors, and the results of measurements. \r\n\r\nDeveloping next-generation Internet measurement requires understanding the complex real-world behavior of network operators around the globe. The project has three thrusts. First, the project will explore and develop methods to understand how routing impacts on-path measurements, globally, with an emphasis on Internet censorship. Second, the project will explore and develop methods understanding how routing impacts end-to-end in-path measurements, focusing on latency, non-determinism, and completeness, with an emphasis on whole-Internet scanning technologies. Third, the project will develop numerous open-source tools and datasets to facilitate the next-generation of path-aware active Internet measurement. \r\n\r\nInternet measurement is used for a range of tasks from influencing government policy, to identifying criminals and state-sponsored attacks, to understanding weather-induced network failures. The correctness of active Internet measurements facilitated by the methodologies, datasets, and tools from this project will enable researchers, industry practitioners, policy makers, and governments to more effectively and correctly achieve these diverse goals. Furthermore, this project will establish a community college-focused pathways program aimed at the dual goals of preparing community college transfer students for a successful experience at a research university, while also providing them network and security research opportunities. This integrated pathways program will improve the likelihood of transfer student's successful progression to graduate school.\r\n\r\nAdditional information about the project, including all research papers, datasets, code, repositories, tools, results, and outreach activities can be found on the project's website: https://cc.gatech.edu/~pearce/career/. The website will be maintained for a period of at least 5 years after completion of the project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
