 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract: Recent advancements in material synthesis and nanotechnology have led to the discovery of new materials with superior properties that arise from quantum confinement and electronic interactions, opening the way to the field of quantum materials and attractive prospects to establish new platforms for future high-performance electronics. In all cases, the practical use of quantum systems brings the challenge of training the broad and diverse workforce that is necessary to transform all this potential into a reality. This project focuses on workforce training while exploring light-matter interaction in quantum materials under irradiation with high-intensity optical fields, in a regime where light can change the material properties and create new quantum states on demand. This project combines transformative research with the development of a new education program in quantum materials and technologies at New Mexico Tech, under the Georgetown University mentorship, with the possibility of involvement of students from other New Mexico colleges and universities. The research activity, curriculum development, and collaboration between institutions provide education and training in quantum materials to Hispanic and other underrepresented minority students at different levels. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: The project's scientific goal is to investigate light-induced magnetism in Floquet-Bloch systems with a synergy of experiment (New Mexico Tech, Georgetown University) and theory (University of Chile-Santiago). Specifically, this project proposes experiments for the magnetometric observation of Floquet-Bloch states in 2D materials (graphene, MoS2, WS2) and 3D materials, e.g., graphite. Magnetometry is a novel and promising approach for detecting Floquet Bloch states. The specific experiments on magnetometry studies of Floquet-Bloch states proposed in this project focus on the development of a sensitive magnetometric measurement technique for Floquet research towards magnetic detection of: 1) Floquet edge-states-related currents in 2D materials; 2) the predicted occurrence of spontaneous non-equilibrium magnetism in graphene; 3) the observation of magneto- valleytronic phenomena in transition metal dichalcogenides and 4) magnetic detection of Floquet-Bloch states in 3D materials.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by The Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (MPS/OMA), the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and Technology Frontiers Program (TIP/TF).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
