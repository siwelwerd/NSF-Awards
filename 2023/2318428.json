 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of technology that can produce large torque without gear systems and with a higher efficiency than existing systems. From drills (small) to escalators (large), most high-torque products require gear systems to amplify the torque given the maximum capacity because the size of the product cannot be increased or decreased indefinitely. However, it is known that gear systems reduce efficiency by as much as 80%. Also, due to irregular loading utility, it experiences vibration and counter torque affecting the motor's life. Moreover, mobile systems requiring huge input power mostly rely on fossil fuels that pollute the environment. The proposed technology is anticipated to affect the electric motor market, especially high torque motors, and it will provide opportunities to form new markets that have not been explored due to the limited efficiency of motors.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a sustainable torque generator which is developed by utilizing multiple Control Moment Gyroscopes that can generate huge gyroscopic torque. However, since the torque generated by the Control Moment Gyroscopes is uncoordinated, singular, and non-permanent, it is difficult to make the Control Moment Gyroscopes a motor system that can generate torque in a constant direction. Nevertheless, by optimizing the configuration of multiple Control Moment Gyroscopes with this mechanism and developing the proprietary control algorithm, this solution can produce large torque without gear systems with higher efficiency than existing systems. This project will challenge the usage of the conventional motor and engine system and establish the benefits of a new gyroscopic effect-driven gearless torque generator.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
