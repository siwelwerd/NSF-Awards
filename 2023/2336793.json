 "awd_abstract_narration": "Western Washington University (Bellingham, Washington) will host the Pacific Northwest Section of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) meeting October 13-15, 2023, the conference website is: https://sites.google.com/view/siampnw23/home. This vertically integrated meeting brings together individuals from undergraduates to distinguished researchers at universities, national labs, and industry, mainly from the Pacific Northwest. These conference participants, working at the forefront of applied and computational mathematics have expertise in many of the key priority areas of the Division of Mathematical Sciences. This meeting will (1) provide a forum for the exchange of recent advances in applied and computational mathematics and their interdisciplinary applications in the applied sciences and engineering, (2) foster new, and reinforce existing collaborations between applied and computational mathematicians working in the Pacific Northwest region, (3) inspire undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers to pursue careers in applied and computational mathematics, and (4) encourage participation from individuals from under-represented groups and smaller regional colleges. Talks during the three day meeting will be organized into parallel blocks of thematic sessions (e.g. \u201cmini-symposium\u201d) consisting of four-five 20-minute talks. A total of about 80 talks are expected. Four distinguished plenary speakers will deliver hour-long talks on broader timely topics. Coffee breaks, catered lunch and a poster session and reception will facilitate an active exchange of ideas between conference attendees.  This year, we expect thematic topics on many traditional areas of applied and computational mathematics as well as topics in emerging areas of large scale optimization, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, energy sustainability, and challenges of  big-data.  This award will support student travel and local expenses to the meeting, partially support plenary speaker travel and the poster reception. \r\n\r\nSIAM is the largest US national organization representing applied mathematicians from both academics and industry. Like the SIAM Annual meeting, and its international counterpart the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM), our upcoming Pacific Northwest SIAM Section Biennial Meeting will be interdisciplinary and will have thematic sessions on a wide range of topics showcasing the diversity of research areas in applied math in the Pacific Northwest. The SIAM-PNW section reflects the larger SIAM organization in that computational mathematics is well-represented in the research areas of its members. Moreover, because the SIAM-PNW has such as large overlap with the Pacific Northwest Numerical Analysis Seminar (held in alternate years), and the Pacific Northwest has such a high concentration of high-tech industry that relies on advanced computational methods, we expect to have a significant number of thematic sessions on topics of particular interest to the computational mathematics communities. Gauging from scientific content of previous meetings, we can expect to have talks and mini-symposium sessions on numerical linear algebra, optimization, novel numerical methods for solving partial differential equations, image processing, statistics, inverse methods and data assimilation, high performance computing, computational algebra and geometry, and numerical modeling and simulation in the geosciences. The plenary speakers for this year's meeting have experise in these areas, as well as in emerging areas of convex optimization, online algorithms, adversarial robustness and machine learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
