 "awd_abstract_narration": "Piece-rate wage system is a popular payment mechanism in the manufacturing sector, but some employers find it difficult to switch to this system for many reasons.  While theoretical work argues that piece-rate wage motivates individual worker effort, it is unclear whether switching from a fixed-wage to piece-rate wage system increases overall worker productivity since piece rates affect labor productivity through multiple channels that may conflict with each other.  This research project takes advantage of an on-going process of change from a fixed wage to a piece-rate wage system in one garment manufacturing plant to study the effects of piece-rate wage on productivity.  The researchers will study how piece-rate wage payment system affects productivity through increased performance monitoring, motivation of individual efforts, as well as recruitment and retention of more productive workers.  The innovative research design will allow the researchers to unbundle the separate effect of each productivity changing mechanism.  The results of this research will guide US businesses on how to implement wage systems that reward productivity, hence increase economic growth and improve the well-being of citizens.   \r\n\r\n\r\nThis DDRIG research project will leverage the introduction of piece-rate wage system in a garment factory to study whether piece-rate wage system increases overall labor productivity relative to a fixed wage system and if so, the mechanisms through which these labor productivity changes occur.  The factory will implement two interventions---performance-based wage scheme and a worker monitoring system.  The implementation of these interventions is staggered, and this staggered roll-out allows the PIs to distinguish the mechanisms---increase monitoring, motivation of individual workers, or recruitment and retention of highly productive workers---through which performance-based wages affect labor productivity. Turnover and heterogeneous treatment of performance-based wages will allow the PIs to analyze  sorting of workers into different performance groups.  The results of this research will guide US businesses on how to implement wage systems that rewards productivity, hence increase economic growth and improve the well-being of citizens.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, the transition from fixed to performance-based pay is intricate and expensive. Past literature on performance pay studies has overlooked the fact that transitioning to performance pay is a long and multifaceted process that can affect productivity outcomes besides motivating individual workers.

Data analysis shows that in the first week of implementing the monitoring system, the treated lines exhibit a significant increase of 14 percentage points. This treatment effect increases to 23 percentage points by the 5th week, with an average rise of 20 percentage points over a 5-week post-treatment period captured by the data. At the individual level, the project identifies a significant positive treatment effect of performance pay on worker productivity. Treated workers in this group experience an average increase of 16.32 percentage points in productivity over a 4-week post-treatment period captured by the data. Due to the limitations of manually collected data, our observations are somewhat noisy and can only demonstrate the effect over a span of 3 weeks. However, this result still reflects a short-term increase in productivity caused by the implementation of the monitoring system.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>2. Impact of Performance Pay</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of performance pay led to a significant improvement in both line and individual-level productivity. Within the first week of implementation, treated production lines showed an average increase of 14 percentage points in productivity. This effect continued to grow, reaching 23 percentage points by the fifth week post-implementation. At the individual worker level, those under the performance-based pay system demonstrated an average increase of 16.32 percentage points in productivity over a four-week period post-implementation. This indicates that aligning financial incentives with performance goals can effectively motivate workers to enhance their productivity, contributing to overall factory efficiency.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>3. Worker Selection</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the project also revealed a positive selection effect among workers. Workers who chose to leave their jobs within two weeks of the performance pay implementation had productivity levels nearly 10 percentage points lower than those who stayed longer. This suggests that the introduction of performance pay may lead to a natural sorting process where less productive workers opt out, potentially raising the average productivity of the remaining workforce.</span></p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Conclusion and Future Directions</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In conclusion, this project contributes to the economic literature on performance pay by offering the first comprehensive analysis of its overall impact.

This offers practical insights for firms to improve efficiency without increasing costs. Moreover, our findings are relevant for the low-income labor market, especially for female workers in textile industries in developing countries reliant on piece-rate pay.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Moving forward, further research could explore longer-term effects and investigate how variations in incentive structures influence productivity in different industrial settings.
