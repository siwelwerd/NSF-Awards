 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Young Mathematicians Conference (YMC) is an annual undergraduate research conference hosted at the Ohio State University. Our diverse group of accepted undergraduate students (typically numbered from 40\u201365) are selected from a competitive application process and invited participants receive travel and lodging support to attend the conference. In addition to the high quality student presentations and poster sessions, the YMC also has plenary speakers from a diverse group of award winning mathematicians. Speakers in the past included recipients of the Fields Medal, the MacArthur and Sloan Fellowships, P\u00f3lya and Nevanlinna Prizes, as well as of the Haimo, Chauvenet, and Allendoerfer Awards for excellence in exposition and teaching.\r\n \r\nParticipants also have the opportunity (and are strongly encouraged) to attend the Graduate School panel where they meet representatives from  several math PhD programs. During the panel, students can ask questions regarding graduate school application process, particulars of the presenting program, and advice on putting together a competitive graduate school applications. YMC is also a gathering spot for selected faculty mentors and REU supervisors to exchange best practices,funding/support opportunities, and discussion of contemporary challenges in running REU programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
