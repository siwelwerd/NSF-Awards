 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ultra-high-energy neutrinos are unique astrophysical messengers as they interact only weakly with intervening matter and can therefore be used to probe high energy sources and extreme conditions throughout the universe, and to test physics at energies beyond the standard models. With support from this award, the PIs will expand the currently operating Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) to enable observations of the highest-energy neutrinos. When combined with observations from other messengers like photons, cosmic rays, and gravitational waves, observations of neutrinos made with RNO-G can further advance our understanding of the most powerful cosmic ray accelerators and explosive events in the universe. This award will engage people from a broad range of backgrounds in multi-messenger astrophysics through this research and through dedicated student workshops and activities.  This award addresses the priority areas of NSF's \"Windows on the Universe\" Big Idea.\r\n \r\nRNO-G\u2019s design is optimized to search for the radio flash generated by neutrino interactions in polar ice using modular stations that act as their own independent experiments. With the large footprint of the full array, RNO-G will have an unprecedented sensitivity and will be the first ultra-high energy neutrino observatory with a view of the Northern sky. This two-year program will continue to build the RNO-G array beyond the seven stations currently installed and operating in Greenland. The supported groups will improve the drill reliability and efficiency to more rapidly install stations in the ice. They will construct and install the instrumentation and commission the stations. They will study radio wave propagation in ice, crucial for accurate modeling of the instrument. They will operate the RNO-G stations in science data-taking mode and study the performance of the instrument.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
