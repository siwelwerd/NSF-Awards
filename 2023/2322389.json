 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader / commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is mass production of a standardized, large-area, silicon-based materials platform (wafer) for photonic integrated circuits. Photonics is the next step in information processing, using light signals instead of electrons. Such a materials platform is expected to revolutionize the silicon photonics market much like the introduction of silicon chips did for the microelectronics industry. The first step to successfully produce such wafers is to manage the extreme thermal stress arising from the combination of two materials (the optical material barium titanate (BaTiO3) and the silicon carrier chips) with very different rates of thermal expansion. Various processing techniques will be investigated to determine how such thermal stress can be mitigated. If successful, this new materials platform will used by telecom and data companies, and may enable new kinds of computing, such as photonic quantum computing.  The total of these industries is expected to exceed $100 billion in combined market size by 2030. \r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project will address one of the critical issues of scaling up barium titanate on silicon technology to thicker and larger area wafers. Barium titanate and silicon have very different thermal expansions and since the integration is achieved by deposition at elevated temperature, cooling causes large stresses to develop. The resulting stress may result in cracks in the film or even in shattering the wafer. Stress also affects the optical performance of the material and therefore, its management is crucial for subsequent device fabrication. The company is developing a process that mitigates this problem (e.g., programmed cooling) which will affect wafer production throughput. In addition, the company must control the direction of ferroelectric polarization, an important customer requirement for making devices. Solving these two issues is crucial to successful commercialization of this technology. Barium titanate films of thicknesses ranging from 0.2 to 2 micrometers will be integrated on silicon and subject to different thermal histories. Residual stress will be measured by x-ray diffraction and corroborated with polarized Raman spectroscopy. The resulting crystal structure, morphology, polarization distribution, and electro-optic performance will be used as metrics for determining if the thermal processing was successful.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It is expected to reach $7.8 Billion globally by 2027. Datacenter transceivers are by far the largest segment of the market and are very sensitive to the speed and power consumption of electro optic (EO) modulators. Our product, Si-integrated barium titanate (BTO), enables the fabrication of extremely efficient ultra-low power and fast integrated modulators, leading to significant energy savings for data center facilities. Since BTO-based modulators are extremely compact and fast, they are also important for ranging devices (automotive LiDAR) for self-driving vehicles and for optical interconnects between chips. Since BTO modulators work well at the telecommunications wavelength band (1550 nm), they will find applications in long-haul transceivers and fiber-based applications. In addition, integrated Si photonics has multiple applications in national security, including reconnaissance, sensing, encryption and optical computing (both quantum and neuromorphic).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For their operation EO modulators need relatively thick BTO films integrated on Si.&nbsp; La Luce Cristallina has developed a unique technology to deliver Si-integrated BTO films with thickness up to one micron. It is the only commercial supplier of this material on silicon. The current prototype that is being shipped to the customers is a small 2&rdquo; wafer. However, for volume manufacturing, large area 8&rdquo; wafers are desired.</p>\r\n<p>For the growth of very thick films and growth on large area wafers, it is critical to address large thermal stresses that can build up across the wafer as the system cools down to room temperature. Films that are thick can start cracking or even delaminating. In addition, one needs to control the optical properties of BTO. Thus the key objectives of this Phase I STTR were to identify causes of thermal stresses during growth and develop ways to minimize or mitigate them. We grew samples with BTO thicknesses from 150, to 1000 nm using sputtering at several different temperatures. We also used different heating and cooling rates. We also tested several different buffer layer (material that interfaces between Si and BTO) thicknesses of 4 and 10 nm. All films were characterized using reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) to study the surface of our films, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to study the compositional quality of the film, X-ray diffraction (XRD) to study the crystalline quality, residual stress and overall polarization direction. The measurements were done to characterize the electro-optic response.</p>\r\n<p>The main findings of Phase I are as follows. (i) We have found that a variation in the starting Si layer thickness, the quality of the crystalline buffer, and the quality of the buffer surface results in a large variation of the BTO quality, and must be tightly controlled before BTO growth. After we have obtained a consistent starting surface for both the Si wafer and the crystalline buffer, we have found that the BTO quality is generally good. The surface is flat with only a few protrusions and there is some residual strain left in the film.&nbsp; (ii) The amount of residual strain decreases as the film thickness increases from 150 to 500 nm, with about 0.25% strain still remaining at 500 nm. (iii) The cooling rate only seems to have a minor effect on strain relaxation but it does have a noticeable but slight effect on surface roughness.</p>\r\n<p>What this project has taught us is that all the observed variation in surface roughness and cracking is coming from the quality of the crystalline buffer. As a buffer, we use SrTiO<sub>3</sub> or STO. &nbsp;We learned to quickly assess the STO buffer quality using in situ RHEED using a technique developed in this STTR project. Once we selected only high quality STO buffers, the BTO film quality has become consistently better. Choosing poorer quality STO confirmed that it was the STO quality that determined BTO surface roughness and morphology.</p>\r\n<p>Another lesson we learned was during our customer discovery. We have demonstrated record low optical loss in monolithic BTO resonators along with excellent modulation. But the commercial impact of this architecture on the market may still be a few years away. The fastest way to break into the integrated photonics market is in the transceiver chips or transceivers that convert optical signals into electrical ones and back in order to ferry data between servers and processors. To capitalize on the existing device architecture while taking advantage of the incredible performance of BTO modulators, a hybrid approach where another material does the light guiding is needed. One needs wafers that combine the guiding and modulating layers in one. This can be achieved through a process known as wafer bonding. Therefore, in Phase II, La Luce Cristallina plans to develop a bonding process and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) protocols for 200 mm BTO wafers in order to be ready to use by transceiver chip makers.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/31/2025<br>\nModified by: Agham&nbsp;Posadas</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2322389/2322389_10895769_1743390861833_BTO_High_Q_Ring_Resonator--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2322389/2322389_10895769_1743390861833_BTO_High_Q_Ring_Resonator--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Barium Titanate High-Q Ring Resonator\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2322389/2322389_10895769_1743390861833_BTO_High_Q_Ring_Resonator--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Barium Titanate High-Q Ring Resonator\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Monolithic ring resonator fabricated out of barium titanate on silicon.
