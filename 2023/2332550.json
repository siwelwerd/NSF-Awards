 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will partially support a Doctoral Colloquium for a pair of co-located conferences, the ACM Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) and the International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC).  UbiComp and ISWC are premier venues for cutting-edge research in design, development, deployment, evaluation, and understanding of wearable and ubiquitous computing systems.  The Doctoral Colloquium of each conference has historically offered the top students in the field a valuable opportunity to present their work and receive feedback; many students who have participated in previous UbiComp Doctoral Colloquia have gone on to become leading academic and industrial researchers in the field. The funding will support students\u2019 participation, including student travel and lodging expenses, as well as the direct expenses of executing the Doctoral Colloquium.  The funding will also allow students who are not supported on existing grants to participate, broadening the composition and perspectives of attendees to everyone's benefit.\r\n\r\nBy combining the two colloquia, the organizers seek to preserve the individual attention paid to each student by the panel while maximizing the interdisciplinary interaction between students.  The event will bring together 24 dissertation-stage doctoral students in the fields of wearable and ubiquitous computing for a full-day session of presentation and discussion. Two panels of four internationally respected faculty and industrial researchers will be convened (one within each field); these mentors will provide detailed feedback to individual students, more general feedback on all student presentations at the colloquia, and career development advice through a closing joint panel.  Student participants will be selected based on a 6-page extended abstract describing their work and its contributions both to the research community and to broader impacts, with the selection committee considering both the value to the student and the value they will bring to the colloquium.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
