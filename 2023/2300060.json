 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to understand how plants produce chemicals in response to different environmental cues. The knowledge attained will augment basic understanding of the biosynthetic pathways for plant specialized metabolites which have important functions in plant communication and defense. It therefore also has the potential to improve crop resilience and agricultural productivity. Legumes are important crops providing a significant portion of protein in human and animal diets and are also essential in cropping systems contributing to sustainability. This project examines how legumes, in particular the model legume Medicago truncatula produces terpenoids, important chemicals that respond to diverse environmental stresses. To accomplish this goal a team of students comprised of undergraduates, doctoral students and postdoctoral scholars will be trained to carry out projects centered on discovery and biochemical analysis of genes involved in the building blocks of terpenoids. Concurrently, the researchers will generate genetic lines that are no longer capable of producing select terpenes to probe the direct eco-physiological importance of these chemicals. This work will provide an informative resource for research in crop legumes. Topics related to the research area are incorporated into an undergraduate biochemistry laboratory class as well as a short module focused on visualizing chemicals targeted at middle and high school students. \r\n\r\nLegumes are important crops because of their agronomic, nutritional and environmental benefits. It is imperative to understand factors that influence their yield and quality. Plants produce a diverse array of specialized metabolites to ensure adaptation to their ecological niche. Terpenoids, a major class of specialized metabolites, play an important role in gene-by-environment interactions, as demonstrated in agricultural crops such as rice and maize. However, terpenoid diversity, evolution and possible ecophysiological significance remains relatively unknown in legumes. Specifically, this project focuses on the experimental definition of gene to metabolite relationship of the terpenome through phylogenetic and biochemical analysis. It also examines the importance of terpenes in response to environmental stress through assessment of the effect of (a)biotic stresses in select genetic knockouts. Improved knowledge of the terpenome will give insights to molecular determinants of chemical responses which are an avenue for insight into improving crop resilience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
