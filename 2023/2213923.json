 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to advance the development of new components for the next generation high-capacity batteries. The rapid acceptance of electric vehicles has caused a high demand for new battery technologies capable of overcoming the existing hurdles. Battery applications such as power grid energy storage, electric aviation, etc. are also rising at fast pace. This project will develop and commercialize new anode materials using nanotechnology to meet the prevailing challenges in the battery industry. The new materials will offer the opportunity of developing high-energy-density, fast-charging, and durable batteries. The proposed technology can be implemented by manufacturers for electric vehicles, electric aviation, grid energy storage, etc. which may, in turn, improve the major global problems of increasing carbon dioxide emissions and decreasing petroleum reserves. The project will also enable several educational and leadership opportunities for students in product design, implementation, data acquisition, entrepreneurship and technology development.\r\n\r\nThe project will advance the use-inspired application of metal sulfide-filled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as anode additive materials and anodes in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Preliminary research suggests that nickel sulfide-filled CNTs can significantly increase the energy density of LIBs. This project will meet the following goals: scaling up the synthesis of nickel sulfide-filled CNTs from research-scale to bench-scale and pilot-scale, understanding the performance of nickel sulfide-filled CNTs as additive materials for commercial anodes such as graphite and silicon, optimizing the loading (weight ratio) of nickel sulfide-filled CNTs as an anode additive, and understanding the performance of nickel sulfide-filled CNTs synthesized on carbon-based substrates as full working anodes for LIBs in different form factors such as coin cells, pouch cells, cylindrical cells, etc. The expected results will fill knowledge gaps in the commercialization of metal sulfide-filled CNTs as anode additives and full anodes. The project will enhance the performance of future LIBs in terms of energy density, charging speed, safety, etc.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
