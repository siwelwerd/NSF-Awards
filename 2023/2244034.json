 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), located in Bar Harbor, ME, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during each summer in 2023-2025. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. Undergraduates will conduct hypothesis-driven research in genetics and functional genomics with JAX research mentors who lead active and collaborative research programs. The program supports student development of highly sought-after computational and data analysis skills. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done through the online SALG URSSA tool. The NSF ETAP system will be used to register participants (https://www.nsfetap.org/). Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nThe REU Site curriculum includes: an online course and certificate program through JAX-developed Minicourses, in-person coding workshops, a formal journal club, professional development seminars, and workshops on the ethical, legal, and social issues in genetics research including Science Advocacy panels. The REU cohort will join the JAX Summer Student Program, a Living Learning Community for up 30 students per year with a well-established structure. Possible student projects are in the areas of computational strategies using genetic data to understand complex genetic systems, fundamental questions in genetics and evolution, how protein glycosylation influences cellular signaling, using modern computer vision tools to connect genetics to tissue structure and organ function, and the genetics of complex traits. Program applications are available through the website http://jax.org/ssp and are generally due the last Monday in January and are reviewed by a team of professional JAX scientists on the basis of the candidate\u2019s research motivation as well as the candidate\u2019s ability to work independently and yet collaboratively.  Researchers inviting students into their labs for the summer make the final student selections. More information about the program is available by visiting http://jax.org/ssp , or by contacting the PI (Dr. Charles Wray, charlie.wray@jax.org) or the co-PI (Dr. Laura Muller, laura.muller@jax.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
