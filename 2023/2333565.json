 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund a two-day conference at the Verdanza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in June 2024 that will focus on viral social interactions. Viruses, often thought of as solitary entities, are in fact highly social. Evolutionary cooperation is key to the success of many viruses, underlying key traits such as genome replication and the construction of virions. At the same time, cooperation often breaks down in viruses, with exploitative viral cheats evolving de novo in almost all known viruses, driving viral population dynamics, evolution, and pathogenicity. Viral social interactions can affect every stage of the viral lifecycle, occur across the virosphere, and raise new questions for the evolution of sociality with broad implications across evolutionary biology. The combination of recent discoveries, new methods, and growing interdisciplinary interest, means that the time is ripe to exploit the social lives of viruses. However, the possibilities of this field are currently being held back, because evolutionary biologists are often unaware of the diversity, importance, or even existence, of social traits in viruses, while virologists only rarely make use of evolutionary theories and concepts that link social traits in viruses to other areas of biology.\r\n\r\nThe conference will target key topics for which synthesis between virologists and evolutionary\r\nbiologists is most useful: cheating in viruses; sociality across the virosphere; social evolution theory for viruses; new model systems; viral communication and cooperation. The principal objective of the meeting will be to foster new interdisciplinary collaborations to drive progress within the emerging field of sociovirology. There will be two additional objectives: (1) publish a perspective piece on sociovirology highlighting conceptual advances made during the meeting; and (2) provide information about the meeting and sociovirology as a whole in a format that can be widely disseminated to the general public, such as a podcast, YouTube video, or publication in print media.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Virus-virus interactions can affect every stage of the viral life cycle, determine the outcomes of infections, and play a key role in virus evolution. However, this important area has been understudied because it requires collaboration between scientists from different disciplines. The main objective of our meeting was to foster collaborations between diverse researchers who study topics related to social interactions in viruses, including researchers within evolution, microbiology, and virology. The meeting was attended by more than 50 scientists from various career stages, countries of origin, and disciplinary backgrounds. Feedback from our meeting was unusually positive. <em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">All</span></em> surveyed participants said they would attend the meeting again. Nearly 90% of participants considered this meeting in the top 10% or better of the meetings they have attended, with nearly half answering that it was \"the best meeting they&rsquo;ve attended in a long time\". As well as healthy exchange of ideas (53% said their favorite feature of the meeting was \"discussion\"), the meeting also led to concrete goals to advance science, with participants reporting connections that could lead to a new paper (44%), new fellowship or job application (33.4%), or new grant application (11.1%). The meeting also provided opportunities for broader impacts in outreach, education, and advancing minority careers, particularly in Puerto Rico where the meeting was hosted. The meeting was attended by graduate students, professors, government researchers from Puerto Rico (&gt;10% of participants). The meeting included a panel on virology challenges and opportunities in Puerto Rico, including local professors and an official from the local CDC branch. This panel raised awareness of potential collaborative and research opportunities in Puerto Rico and fostered connections with researchers stateside and internationally.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/31/2024<br>\nModified by: Samuel&nbsp;L&nbsp;Diaz</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2333565/2333565_10874200_1730404605633_group_picture.001--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2333565/2333565_10874200_1730404605633_group_picture.001--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Group Picture of Conference Participants\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2333565/2333565_10874200_1730404605633_group_picture.001--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Group Picture of Conference Participants\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Group Picture of Conference Participants at the Social Lives of Viruses Conference in Carolina PR June 5-7, 2024</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Conference Participant</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Samuel&nbsp;L&nbsp;Diaz\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Group Picture of Conference Participants</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2333565/2333565_10874200_1730404927584_countries_origin.001--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2333565/2333565_10874200_1730404927584_countries_origin.001--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Map of Countries of Origin for Conference Participants\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2333565/2333565_10874200_1730404927584_countries_origin.001--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Map of Countries of Origin for Conference Participants\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Map depicting the countries of origin for conference participants that responded to our survey.
