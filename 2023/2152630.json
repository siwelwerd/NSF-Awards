 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund the acquisition of a gas chromatography mass spectrometer and an isotope ratio mass spectrometer for biomarker identification, quantification, and measurement. Plant wax biomarkers serve as a protective coating on living plants and have proven the capability to yield geological evidence spanning decades to millions of years. There is considerable interest in tracking changes in the carbon cycle through time, changes in ecosystems, and changes in hydroclimate.  Future research of this group at the University of Southern California (USC) depends upon replacement of aging instrumentation. A particular focus will be on the Miocene time period, which is increasingly being recognized as a suitable analogue environment for future climate change. The principal investigator seeks a dense network of hydroclimate and vegetation records to assess response to global warmth. Allied to this will be understanding of the food-water-soil nexus via translational activities of this geological research to modern plant-soil continuums to optimize soil carbon sequestration and minimize plant water usage. \r\n\r\nIn addition to these research objectives, the new analytical capability will enable hands-on learning for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and some advanced undergraduate students toward career readiness in analytical sciences as demonstrated by recent placements of trainees. The principal investigator has a strong track record of developing research experiences for diverse STEM trainees with career interests related to their biogeochemistry laboratory and analytical experience at USC, that find careers in environmental, food and health sciences and engineering in academic, government and corporate sectors. Instrument related communications include a webpage with resources including laboratory protocols, scripts, parts list and instructional video on Youtube, to which new content videos will be added to support the development of the next generation of researchers. A new local connection with Santa Monica College (SMC), will offer flexible two-way mentoring and training connections, building awareness of laboratory instrumentation and research questions to SMC students, and providing project management and team-leading experience for USC graduate students towards career readiness.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
