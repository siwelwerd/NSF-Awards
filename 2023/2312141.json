The event will provide a forum for updates on NSF funding opportunities, policies and procedures. Additionally, participants will share successful practices in STEM broadening participation post-pandemic. Activities will include recognition of the 20th Anniversary of the Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity, established in 2003.  A career fair and the launch of the BD Mentorship Program, in conjunction with the Louis Stokes Midwest Regional Center of Excellence, a collaboration with CSU and Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), is planned.\r\n\r\nAll LSAMP program grantees, selected BD participants, and representatives from federal laboratories and the corporate sector will participate. Proceedings from the meeting will be disseminated broadly via the organizer's websites.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This convening of LSAMP stakeholders (NSF Program Officers &amp; Directors, Principal Investigators, Project Directors, Business &amp; Industry Partners, Bridge to Doctorate Fellows (BDs), and other LSAMP Associates and support staff) provided a forum for the exchange of information, instruction on new policies and procedures, as well as an examination of best practices and strategies for maximizing STEM Broadening Participation efforts post-pandemic. This meeting also celebrated the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate activity. This report highlights the key outcomes and impacts of the project and how this dedicated time of networking among LSAMP stakeholders is crucial to continuing efforts to closing the gap for minoritized population in STEM fields.</p>\r\n<p>As the first fully on-site NSF LSAMP PI/PD Meeting since the Covid-19 pandemic, this meeting attracted 211 in-person attendees, including 19 Bridge to the Doctorate Fellows who made presentations on their research. Over the course of the Meeting, stakeholders participated in a total of seven Plenary Sessions, three Keynotes, and Alliance specific breakout sessions. In addition, a separate track for BD Fellows included a special Opening Keynote focused on Overcoming Systemic Barriers to Achieve Success in STEM, as well as multiple sessions on student success and mentoring. An overarching goal of the PI/PD Meeting was to provide an inclusive atmosphere for engaging with the NSF leadership and Program Officers/Directors. Considering this goal, several sessions were devoted to funding opportunities, NSF Systems Based Platforms, grant award management, and a Q&amp;A session with the LSAMP Program Officers. There were sessions on&nbsp; targeted grant opportunities from ExLENT and specific NSF Directorates, including EES, EDU,&nbsp; and TIP. This type of direct conversation served to amplify both opportunities and challenges within the LSAMP community and provided a community centered approach to continued progress. The Meeting offered several options for professional development through coordinated meetings with Alliances and workshops, such as &ldquo;Recent Approaches to Improving STEM Learning Outcomes&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mentoring Minority Students&rdquo;, &ldquo;Encouraging Inclusive Innovation in LSAMP&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Culturally Responsive Evaluation&rdquo;. These plenary and breakout sessions served to enhance attendees resources and knowledge for continued elevation of their Alliance programming initiatives through new research and peer-implemented success strategies.</p>\r\n<p>Furthering the Meeting focus on the 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Bridge to the Doctorate, a considerable amount of knowledge exchanged centered on the impact of this program and its noticeable gains in broadening participation. For both BD Fellows and attending PIs/PDs, the conference addressed various approaches to eliminating barriers to the Ph.D., building resilient and resourceful students, and the increase in job prospects for Ph.D. students in both academia and industry. These efforts were realized in plenary and panel discussions, roundtable workshops on mentoring, and a resource fair that included representatives from colleges and universities, industry partners, and other NSF funded programs like Engineering Plus. Ultimately, the 2023 NSF LSAMP PI/PD Meeting was a valuable testament to the commitment, resilience, and impact of the LSAMP program and served to provide resources, engagement, and support to the national LSAMP community.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/28/2025<br>\nModified by: Christopher&nbsp;Botanga</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div
