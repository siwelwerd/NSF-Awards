 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solid catalysts play an important role in energy-efficient commercial processes used to produce fuels, chemicals, and energy, and also in pollution mitigation. Most commercial solid catalysts used today consist of metal particles supported on high surface area support materials. Improvements in these catalysts are needed to further improve their efficiency. Successful research in this area results in lower energy consumption and reduced environmental impact of many chemical processes. One approach to this goal is through control of the interfaces between the metal particles and the support materials. In this project, Dr. Nikolla (Wayne State University) and Dr. Medlin (University of Colorado) are developing an understanding these metal/support interfaces with the objective of discovering more active and efficient catalysts. Dr. Nikolla and Dr. Medlin actively engage in outreach activities related to the education of young students, especially those from underrepresented groups. For example, they are developing workshops for underrepresented K-12 female students to enhance their understanding and desire in pursuing higher education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Dr. Nikolla and Dr. Medlin are also designing activities to inform parents about STEM fields, so that the parents can encourage their children to pursue STEM education.\r\n\r\nWith funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Eranda Nikolla of Wayne State University and Dr. Will Medlin of University of Colorado are developing an understanding of solid metal/metal oxide interfaces in \"inverted\" catalytic systems with the objective of enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity in chemical reactions. They are synthesizing controlled metal oxide-encapsulated metal nanoparticles (i.e., M@MO structures) with systematic variations in structure and composition of both the metal and metal oxide components.  The research team correlates these synthetic variations to the surface chemical properties and catalyst performance. Fundamental insights from experimental model catalysts coupled with advanced characterization and computational studies on inverted catalyst systems are being used to advance the understanding of interfacial chemistry. The encapsulated catalyst systems are also being investigated as a platform for controlling the near-surface environment around the reactive interface through functionalization of the oxide pores with organic ligands.  Dr. Nikolla and Dr. Medlin are actively engaged with educational and research outreach activities aimed at inspiring and informing undergraduate and K-12 female students from underrepresented groups regarding STEM fields and research in the area of catalysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
