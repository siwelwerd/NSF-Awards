 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project at Minnesota Duluth promotes progress in fundamental neutrino physics and particle astrophysics.  The major part of the work supports the design and installation of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE).   The experiment aims to resolve mysteries about the matter vs. antimatter asymmetry of the universe, search for beyond-the-standard-model physics effects related to proton decay and dark matter, and measure neutrinos from a galactic supernova.   These are among the highest priority scientific goals in particle physics.   Undergraduate and M.S. students trained on this project, like recent students, go on to technical careers in technology, energy, and defense, some pursuing advanced degrees along the way.\r\n\r\nThe two PIs and the supported students contribute to the project goals in complementary ways, including sustained leadership positions.  One is working on sensitivity analyses for the DUNE oscillation experiment focused on the value added by proposed Near Detector designs.   The group is leading the inclusion of field-leading model systematic uncertainties drawn from MINERvA, operating experiments such as NOvA, T2K, and SBN, and recent theory developments.  The other PI has a major role in the installation of computing and electronics infrastructure.   These are needed for the full experiment, but a subset are designed especially to buffer data to enable non-beam analysis such as supernova neutrinos and proton decay measurements.   This project also supports continuing effort on the MINERvA and NOvA experiments.   The analysis and operational activities support completion of those experiment\u2019s scientific missions but simultaneously are an intellectual investment in DUNE.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
