 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists seek to understand the distribution and abundance of living organisms. However, translating ecological theory to effective resource management requires quantitative tools and practices including ecological models. This need for a more quantitative approach has led to an emerging but diffuse discipline: Predictive Ecology. Predictive ecology places prediction and forecasting at the center of both theoretical and applied ecology. Managing ecological systems at scales that are relevant to human wellbeing is a predominant goal in ecosystem ecology. There is a need to coordinate among scientists working with high frequency and large scale data to better model large-scale ecosystem change. This project supports diverse researchers to attend a Gordon Research Conference in Predictive Ecology held in June 2023. At the conference, a strong and broad foundation for predictive ecology over the next decade is developed. The activities at the conference and the supported individuals will advance a set of methods for the next generation of ecologists and ecosystem scientists.\r\n\r\nThe proposed program of 30 confirmed speakers is a diverse group of scientists including ecosystem scientists, ecologists, epidemiologists, economists, computer scientists, and data scientists. The short-term impact of the conference is to develop a road map and a set of best practices for predictive ecology. The conference brings together a wide variety of researchers to ensure that ecological models are integrated into social, environmental and resource management policy and decision-making. This conference develops the field of predictive ecology by developing a network of predictive ecology researchers and a clear framework defining best practices for predictive ecology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
