 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to investigate how the complex flow and transport processes that occur in microvascular networks regulate vessel remodeling. By integrating a novel computational model with high-resolution imaging data, the project will help unveil mechanisms underlying both structural adaptation of blood vessels and the crucial role of oxygen transport in tissue function. This project will lead to a better understanding of the relationship between blood flow, vascular remodeling, and oxygen transport that may lead to advancements in wound healing strategies, tissue engineering approaches, and the development of artificial organs. The research program will involve graduate and undergraduate students and outreach efforts based on creating an interactive visualization of the circulatory system for local high school students.\r\n\r\nVascular networks undergo structural adaptation driven by mechanical and metabolic cues, including vessel growth, shrinkage, and pruning. Microvascular networks undergo rapid and significant changes, making vascular remodeling a critical element of the flow and transport dynamics. While the circulatory system has been extensively studied, the flow and transport processes that occur within microvascular networks and their influence on vascular remodeling are poorly understood. In particular, the role of three-dimensional geometry, transvascular and extravascular flow in blood dynamics and oxygen transport on microvascular networks that are undergoing remodeling has been understudied partially because of limitations of existing computational methods. To bridge this gap, a unique computational method based on integration with in vivo imaging data through the diffuse-domain approach will be developed in this project. The model will lead to new fundamental understanding of the flow and transport processes that control structural adaptation of microvascular networks. This research has significant implications in diverse disciplines, offering a valuable tool to explore the intricate flow and transport processes in microvascular networks and their role in different biological phenomena, including wound healing and tissue regeneration. The project may also lead to advances in drug delivery and organoid development. The project will also use the data obtained from 3D simulations to produce an interactive visualization using a video game engine that will be presented in a local High School.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
