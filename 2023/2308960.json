 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel grant will be used for offsetting the cost of attendees participating at the 14th Annual Power and Energy Conference at Illinois (PECI). Beginning in 2010, PECI is the oldest annual, student-run IEEE international conference about power and energy technology. The conference is organized by the IEEE PES/PELS/IAS Joint Graduate Student Chapter at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and is advised by faculty in the Power and Energy area of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. PECI has become a perfect place in the Midwest for industry, academic researchers, and students to discuss future power and energy topics such as renewable energy, machines for electric transportation, smart grid reliability, security of cyber physical systems, and power electronics for emerging technologies. The travel funding for PECI 2023 will support underrepresented students such as those from primarily undergraduate or minority institutions. Students who apply for funding will be encouraged to present either a poster or paper and will compete for Best Paper and Best Poster Awards. \r\n\r\nThe travel funding for PECI 2023 will help introduce students to innovative power-focused technologies in both the academic and industry sectors, in fields such as machines, power systems, power electronics and entrepreneurship. This will advance the power engineering community by fostering discussion between the leaders of tomorrow and current academic and industry professionals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
