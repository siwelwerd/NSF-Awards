 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the 20th International Meeting for the Cell and Molecular Biology of Chlamydomonas, to be held June 4-9, 2023 at Princeton University, NJ.  Chlamydomonas is a fascinating single-celled swimming photosynthetic organism that has been used to understand photosynthesis as well as the formation and behavior of cilia, key structures that regulate interactions with the environment in cells of all larger species, including humans.  Recent advances in the field, including new technological capabilities, will be highlighted in this meeting. The meeting will bring together seasoned investigators with early-career scientists in both formal talks and discussion sessions to encourage informal discussion and sharing of latest research results on the formation of structures in the cell, swimming behavior, and regulation of photosynthesis during daily changes in light levels.\r\n\r\nThis meeting will be attended by undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, as well as senior researchers to discuss our understanding of all aspects of the biology of the photosynthetic single-celled green alga Chlamydomonas, which has long been used as a model for understanding photosynthesis and structure of cilia.  Talks will be presented on topics such as cilia and basal bodies, organelle biogenesis, cell cycle and circadian rhythms, environmental responses, and newly available methods for studying these organisms.  In addition to formal talks, engagement will be facilitated by two poster sessions to stimulate interactions between researchers.  NSF support will be used to defray travel costs to allow attendance of participants from early stages of their careers, especially for members of groups underrepresented in this field.\r\n\r\nThis award is funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
