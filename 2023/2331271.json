 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this Accelerating Research Translation award, George Mason University \u2013 in collaboration with the Center for Climate Strategies \u2013 will create university-wide programming that enables the rapid, low-cost translation of the science that local governments, community-based organizations, and local businesses need to support the development of sustainable, equitable, and climate-resilient communities. Climate-related disasters are increasing in frequency and intensity \u2013 and are costing the United States billions of dollars in damages each year. Communities in Virginia are already experiencing harmful effects of climate change as extreme weather and precipitation, extreme heat, and sea level rise damage infrastructure; disrupt work, commerce, and transportation; destroy livelihoods; and cost lives \u2013 but the wide-spread implementation of science-based solutions remains elusive. Drawing inspiration from the cooperative extension service, this award will establish a transformative new model for research translation; one that leverages the unique resources of higher education, in collaboration with community stakeholders, to address this gap and co-develop resilience to climate change. \r\n\r\nThis award will accelerate the translation of research into practice to create climate-ready communities throughout Virginia (objective 1); establish and foster a culture of translating research through community engagement, technical assistance, and the co-production of research-informed products (objective 2); and create a climate-ready workforce of scholars, practitioners, and leaders with the skills and expertise needed to put research on climate change into practice (objective 3). These programs will be organized into three distinct but interrelated and integrated categories of activity: (a) facilitated and coordinated outreach and ongoing engagement with municipal and other community-based stakeholders; (b) community-focused research translation that is propelled by a modified lean launchpad program that supports the development of seed translational research projects (STRP); and (c) integrated training programs to create a climate-ready workforce. The first two STRPs will focus on the co-production of solutions that mitigate flood hazards (STRP 1) and reduce the impacts of urban heat (STRP 2) on frontline communities. New instructional programs established by this award will create climate science-literate instructors, use-inspired scientists who are willing and able to translate their research into practice, and social entrepreneurs. Municipal and other community-based practitioners will also be trained in how and why to use science-based methods, tools, and data to plan and implement climate change resilience strategies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
