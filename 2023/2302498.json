 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the Southwest Local Algebra Meeting at the University of North Texas, March 4\u20135, 2023. The conference will catalyze interactions between students and faculty from institutions throughout the Southwest working broadly in rings, fields, and groups. Algebraists in the region pursue research on a variety of topics under the umbrella of pure and applied algebra, but the geographical distances between institutions make it difficult to establish new collaborations. This meeting will bring together students and faculty from a variety of backgrounds for lively talks, scientific interactions, and professional networking, with ample time to explore new research projects. About 80 \u2013 100 participants are expected from throughout the Southwest and South regions, including graduate students and both junior and senior faculty. The meeting particularly encourages participation of algebraists from groups historically underrepresented in mathematics, as well as nontenured faculty and faculty at non-PhD-granting institutions. \r\n\r\nAlgebraic structures are crucial to many branches of mathematics, including coding theory, cryptography, combinatorics, geometry, topology, number theory, and mathematical physics. At this conference, six experts will deliver hour-long talks accessible to graduate students, and students will present research in three hour-long poster sessions. The speakers are specialists in algebraic combinatorics, automorphic forms, homological algebra, algebraic geometry, non-commutative geometry, and both commutative and non-commutative algebra. This variety of interests is expected to bolster creative interactions between participants. More information can be found at the conference webpage: http://www.math.ttu.edu/~lchriste/slam2023.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
