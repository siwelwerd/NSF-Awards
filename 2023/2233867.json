 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a workshop for Postdoctoral Research Fellows in Biology, supported by the Broadening Participation of Groups Underrepresented in Biology track. The workshop is designed to serve fellows from the 2022 cohort by providing support for 24 fellows to attend a workshop facilitated by SACNAS (Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science). The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for promoting best practices and assessment of broadening participation activities, professional and career development, and to catalyze formation of a virtual cohort.\r\n\r\nPostdoctoral Fellows conduct research across all fields of biology supported by the Directorate for Biological Sciences. The Fellows in this track also increase participation at the postdoctoral level through training for advanced careers and engagement with other postdoctoral scientists from groups underrepresented in science. The workshop will allow Fellows to exchange ideas and learn from experts about best practices and assessment of activities to broaden participation. To promote professional development, senior scientists will share effective strategies and information for different career paths. The venue for the workshop is 2022 SACNAS \u2013 The National Diversity in STEM Conference. The activities will occur in a day-long workshop prior to SACNAS followed by meetings throughout the three-day conference. Common interests and interactions during the workshop will make possible the formation of collaborations that persist as the Fellows disperse to their home research institutions across the US. Overall the workshop will contribute to the national goal of increasing STEM diversity by supporting leadership in broadening participation and the career success of the Fellows, who themselves comprise a diverse group.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
