 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site: Interdisciplinary Research Experiences in Nanotechnology and Biomedicine at the University of Georgia (UGA) aims to attract and retain students from institutions with limited research opportunities in science and engineering and prepare them for graduate programs and careers in these fields. Nanobiotechnology research is an emerging interdisciplinary area at the interface of nanotechnology and biomedicine. This three-year project provides an interdisciplinary research experience to undergraduate students, leveraging the interdisciplinary expertise, resources, and training opportunities. Ten REU students over a 10-week summer program each year will participate in interdisciplinary research projects that apply nanotechnology to specific biomedical questions. Each REU student will be co-mentored by paired faculty from the nanotechnology and biomedical disciplines on a collaborative research project. This REU experience will recruit students from many backgrounds. Over 60% of participants will come from academic institutions where research opportunities are limited. This recruitment is expected to broaden participation within the next generation of scientists and engineers in interdisciplinary research endeavors.\r\n\r\nThis three-year REU Site: Interdisciplinary Research Experiences in Nanotechnology and Biomedicine at the University of Georgia (UGA) aims to attract and retain students from institutions with limited research opportunities in science and engineering and prepare them for graduate programs and careers in these fields. Nanobiotechnology research is an emerging interdisciplinary area at the interface of nanotechnology and biomedicine. Over a ten-week summer program, ten REU students each year will engage in an interdisciplinary research experience in nanobiotechnology, with research projects co-mentored by faculty in nanotechnology and biomedicine. The existing world-class programs, facilities, collaborative research culture, and inclusive environments at the university create a strong setting for this interdisciplinary site. Students will be recruited nationwide with particular emphasis on students from STEM limited institutions. Through the program, students will (1) design hypotheses-driven research experiments to solve biomedical problems with engineering tools; (2) develop skills for conducting interdisciplinary research; (3) gain confidence and a sense of self-efficacy to participate in science and engineering research, (4) develop a greater understanding and appreciation for the benefits of interdisciplinary research. Research mentors will also gain expertise in mentoring students in interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
