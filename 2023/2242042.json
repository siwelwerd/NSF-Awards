 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phytoplankton are microscopic plants that live in the ocean and act as the base of the marine food web. These microorganisms use inorganic nitrogen (N) from the water to make a variety of amino acids. Some of the amino acids keep the initial chemical signature (i.e., N isotope value) of their N source. Other amino acids are involved in metabolic processes that change the initial chemical signature (N isotope value). These distinct N isotope signatures are passed along to organisms that consume phytoplankton and throughout the food web. Thus, the N isotope values of individual amino acids can be used to obtain the isotope value of N sources supporting food webs and to estimate the trophic position of organisms in biota, particles, coral skeletons, and sediments. But, this requires a clear understanding of the N isotope patterns of amino acids produced by phytoplankton. This project will examine whether different phytoplankton species produce amino acids with distinct N isotope patterns when using the same N source. The project will also study whether the N isotope patterns produced by the same species of phytoplankton change under different growth and environmental conditions. Information from this study will improve the ability to use N isotope values in amino acids in ecological and biogeochemical studies. This collaborative project combines novel research with broader impacts focused on engaging the public and promoting diversity and inclusion at various levels. Three graduate students and one postdoc will participate in the research. Research opportunities will be provided to undergraduate students, especially those with backgrounds. Students will be recruited through the McNair and Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation program at Texas A&M Univ. at Corpus Christi, a Hispanic Serving and Minority Serving Institution. To share results broadly, the investigators and students will give talks about marine science to local K-12 students in Corpus Christi TX. The New Bedford High School (in MA) summer marine intern program will be engaged in this project. Public lectures will be given on the topic of algal blooms and a children\u2019s article will be written on the topic of isotopes. Outcomes of this project will also be incorporated into presentations to the Chesapeake Bay Program, Maryland Harmful Algal Bloom Task Force, and the Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee of the Maryland Coastal Bays. \r\n \r\nThe use of N isotope values of different amino acids (\u03b415N-AA) to retrieve the N source isotope signature of food webs and estimate trophic positions depends on information about the \u03b415N-AA produced by phytoplankton at the base of the food web which is still poorly understood. This study seeks to explore fundamental scientific questions to better understand \u03b415N-AA produced by phytoplankton. 1) Under the same nitrogenous nutrient and growth conditions, do \u03b415N-AA patterns vary between major phytoplankton groups? Are the unique \u03b415N-AA patterns in diatoms related to unique aspects of their N metabolism? 2) Do changes in phytoplankton physiology resulting from nitrogenous nutrient availability, N form utilized (ammonium, nitrate, and mixed), and/or other growth conditions independently produce significant changes in \u03b415N-AA? Phytoplankton samples will be collected from controlled culture (e.g., chemostat) experiments and from field studies in the Gulf of Mexico and Chesapeake Bay, especially during near-monospecific bloom events. By taking the advantage of newly developed analytical approaches, new knowledge of compound and intramolecular \u03b415N of poly-N AA such as arginine, asparagine, glutamine, and histidine in phytoplankton will be generated for the first time. This ground-truthing work will advance the understanding of \u03b415N-AA pattern produced by key phytoplankton species critical to the biological pump and harmful algal blooms under environmentally relevant physiological conditions. The expected outcomes from this work will enable new applications and more sophisticated trophic position analyses, studies of the efficiency of the ocean\u2019s biological pump, and paleo-oceanographic reconstructions using amino acids preserved in natural archives.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
