 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses the unique data set acquired by the gigaton-scale IceCube Neutrino Observatory, located at the South Pole, to explore for signatures of new physics. The IceCube data set comprises the highest energy neutrino interactions observed on Earth. The neutrino interactions to be used in the analyses supported by this grant are in a range that is x20 to x200 higher than the highest energy accelerator-produced neutrino interactions produced today. Because signatures for Beyond Standard Model Physics are expected to become more apparent with energy, IceCube data opens a new window on a rich array of predicted Beyond Standard Model effects, as well as an opportunity to follow up on anomalous behavior that may point to new physics.  The group will continue and expand upon the very successful CosmicWatch program that provides instructions for building simple muon detectors that can be used for teaching and other outreach activities.  \r\n\r\nThe project will allow for the first high-energy, full three-flavor search for Beyond Standard Model signatures in neutrino physics utilizing flavor-tagged events in the 1 to 100 TeV-scale. IceCube has the unique capability of  observing resonance signatures of matter effects induced if neutrinos with exotic properties pass through the dense Earth. The analysis will expand a data set developed by the PIs since 2014 that unites the Neutrino, Energy, Cosmic, and Rare Process Frontiers. The data set will reach 100~TeV and comprise more than one million upward-going neutrino events flavor identified on an event-by-event basis. The flux sources in the sample are atmospheric neutrinos and a highly-enriched astrophysical sample isolated through directional information - the first high-purity astrophysical sample below 60 TeV.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
