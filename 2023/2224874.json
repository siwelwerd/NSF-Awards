 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most plants and animals are multicellular- composed of millions or billions of cells with specialized functions.  Communication between these cells is essential, as it helps coordinate growth, development and physiology. Plants have a special mode of communication whereby they transport biological signals composed of proteins and nucleic acids between cells. These signals pass though nanochannels called plasmodesmata. Despite the fact that plasmodesmata are essential for plant survival, very little is known about how they control and transport different signals. A clearer understanding of this process has the potential to enhance crop productivity, and to control the spread of plant diseases. Hence, this proposal will advance knowledge in a fundamental area of plant biology, and has the potential to improve agricultural crops. The project will also train young scientists at various levels, from high school to post-doctoral, in cutting edge biological research. The PI serves as Director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Partners For the Future program, which immerses local high school students in active research labs. The project team will also develop an educational alliance with Genspace, a Citizen Science organization in Brooklyn, New York. This alliance will engage with a minority serving High School in Brooklyn, New York and will host college and career preparedness sessions, and teach labs and lead discussions in plant genetics research. These activities are aimed at sharing the excitement and applications of plant genetics research to students who otherwise have little exposure to the scientific method.\r\n\r\nMost plant cells are connected to their neighbors by specialized nanochannels called plasmodesmata (PDs).  PDs control the transport of signaling molecules, including proteins and mRNAs, as well as metabolites, allowing organismal coordination of physiology and development. This project will study the PD transport of mRNAs that encode homeodomain transcription factors, important for plant growth and stem cell fate. An RNA binding protein is required for trafficking of these mRNAs, providing a mechanism for how this signaling process may be controlled. The project will study protein-RNA interactions to ask how the RNA binding protein transports specific RNAs, and will ask which additional mRNAs it interacts with. The project will also develop chimeric plants and use single cell sequencing to screen for additional mobile mRNA signals. Trafficking of regulatory mRNAs provides a system to understand how plasmodesmata coordinate stem cell function during plant development. Application of this research in fine tuning of mRNA localization could allow engineering of crop plants to optimize their growth and responses to the environment, leading to increased productivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
