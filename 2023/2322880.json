 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the efforts of a team of undergraduate students from various STEM disciplines at the University of Virginia. The team will develop a low cost, non-invasive, effective topical treatment for Staphylococcus-based cellulitis for the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition in synthetic biology. The development and production of this device will provide undergraduate students with hands-on training in a variety of scientific areas, including synthetic biology, molecular biology and computational modeling. The project supports the bioeconomy by introducing students to and creating an opportunity for student-driven entrepreneurship within the field of synthetic biology.  In addition, student participants acquire a global perspective on innovation, strategic road mapping, and professional community, while recognizing structural barriers to fair resource sharing and access to new technologies.  Broadening participation in STEM research is an important goal of this project.\r\n\r\nThis project supports the interdisciplinary research training of a diverse team of undergraduate students at the University of Virginia. The team will develop skin-penetrating anti-microbial peptides that are specific for Staphylococcus and that have the potential to be produced at scale. The project will be developed for the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition in synthetic biology. The participants will receive training in a variety of STEM disciplines, acquire a global perspective on innovation and strategic road mapping, and have many opportunities to network with leaders in STEM fields such as synthetic biology, molecular biology and computational modeling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
