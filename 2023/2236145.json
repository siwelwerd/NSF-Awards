 "awd_abstract_narration": "Primates such as apes and monkeys are known for their unusual brain size and cognitive complexity. However, there is uncertainty about whether these exceptional traits have evolved across the entire spectrum of primate diversity. To better understand the evolution of complex intelligence in primates requires comparative data. Towards that end, this doctoral dissertation research project examines the ecology, sociality, and cognitive behavior of an understudied ancient primate lineage. Results can provide key insights into how cognitive complexity has evolved in primates. The project supports mentorship of student researchers and international research collaborations. It also involves an interdisciplinary collaboration that integrates ideas from biological anthropology and electromechanical engineering to develop novel remote biologging technologies. This collaboration can facilitate the future collection of spatial and movement data on many smaller-bodied nocturnal species for which this type of data has been traditionally unattainable.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to identify ecologically and socially relevant cognitive adaptations in a wild population of nocturnal strepsirrhine primates, thick-tailed galagos, to determine how socioecological pressures shape patterns of cognitive evolution in nocturnal strepsirrhine primates compared to diurnal gregarious primates. The researchers utilize manual behavioral observation, newly developed biologging technology, vocalization playback experiments, field-adapted cognitive tests, and comparative statistical analysis to collect and analyze relevant cognitive and behavioral data on thick-tailed galagos. If similar cognitive abilities are observed in the galago lineage as in gregarious, diurnal primate lineages, then there may be a preserved evolutionary blueprint of specific socioecological conditions selecting for specialized sets of cognitive adaptations in primates that predates the divergence of the galagos. Comparing cognitive adaptations between thick-tailed galagos and other primates presenting similar socioecological traits can help determine how specific socioecological pressures affect primate cognitive evolution across taxa and help contextualize the ultimate evolutionary origins of human cognitive abilities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As most research focuses on haplorrhine primates (monkeys and apes), we studied a strepsirrhine primate, the thick-tailed bushbaby, <em>Otolemur crassicaudatus</em>, to understand how cognitive abilities manifest in an enigmatic nocturnal primate as compared to in group-living diurnal primates. By doing so, we can better understand how ecological conditions and evolutionary history shape primate cognitive abilities across the spectrum of primate diversity.</p>\r\n<p>Our research reveals significant overlap in <em>O. crassicaudatus</em> home ranges, with multiple adult males, adult females, and juveniles living in the same patches. Importantly this means that <em>O. crassicaudatus</em> social networks are notably larger than previously thought, with a form a social organization most closely resembling the age-graded male groupings often observed in highly studied apes and monkeys. Members of <em>O. crassicaudatus</em> social groups communicate using nightly scent marking and vocalizations and, while they tend to utilize consistent home ranges, they demonstrate the use of flexible foraging pathways indicative of strong spatial memory abilities. These results suggest that, despite their nocturnal habits and distinct evolutionary history, <em>O. crassicaudatus</em> appear to converge with many diurnal, gregarious primates in aspects of cognitive complexity.</p>\r\n<p>Our project also generated significant broader impacts to the scientific community in our host country of South Africa. To collect data on the movement of the animals, we established a new automated radio-based tracking grid at the Lajuma Research Centre. Compared to traditional GPS-based technology, the trackers in our system are significantly less expensive ($210/tag) and consist of a combination of light weight (~350mg) and long-lasting batteries (1+ years) that GPS is unable to match. The tracking grid has become a permanent fixture at Lajuma, and the low energy/low-cost nature of the system allows for easy extension to study other species at the site. Expanding the system to the mammalian and avian communities at Lajuma will be incredibly informative for determining niche construction, modelling ecological competition, developing testable models regarding environmental community assemblages, and helping develop feasible conservation strategies at the site. This automated tracking system has already attracted external researchers to the site, and we intend that it be used as a resource for South African researchers for years to come.</p>\r\n<p>This project provided training and valuable experience in behavioral research for two South African students (Precious Vilakazi and Lindokuhle Mgwaba) working as research assistants. The students were exposed to and trained in different methodologies such as the use of ethograms, radio telemetry, GPS tracking, and camera trap monitoring. They were able to network with researchers from 6 countries across North America, Europe, and Africa while at Lajuma and forge connections that should benefit them throughout their careers. Further, since the conclusion of the research period, both assistants have since moved on to fill prestigious research positions as a direct result of their work on this project. Ms. Vilakazi has begun work on a master&rsquo;s degree at the most prestigious university in South Africa, while Mr. Mgwaba is managing a crane conservation project working for an international conservation organization.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/18/2025<br>\nModified by: John&nbsp;K&nbsp;Dalton</p></div>\n<div
