 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of an electrocatalytic formic acid production process directly from carbon dioxide (CO2) and electricity. This process will mitigate greenhouse gas emissions while producing formic acid, currently used in agriculture for silage preservation, leather tanning, and the chemical industry. The economic analysis projects that such an electrocatalytic process can currently compete with oil/gas-derived formic acid in the current market. Furthermore, this process has the potential to achieve net negative greenhouse gas emissions, meaning it will consume carbon dioxide in order to produce valuable chemical products. Immediate applications include using waste CO2 from sources such as bio-ethanol production, pyrolysis plants, landfill gas, power plants with carbon capture technology, etc. Formic acid production from CO2 feedstock in a renewable-powered, low-temperature process is expected to offset CO2 emissions equivalent to ~1 million tons, but with future further transportation and energy storage markets, the CO2 impact can reach the gigaton scale.\r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase II project develops a low-energy consumption electrolyzer for CO2 utilization in a process powered by electricity rather than heat. The electrolyzer combines the cathodic reduction of CO2 and water to formic acid with anodic water oxidation. Formic acid is a major commodity chemical used in agriculture, leather treatment, and environmentally-friendly deicing of roadways. Future markets include its use as a liquid hydrogen storage media. Electrosynthesis of carbon products from CO2 has generally been plagued with low electrical and process energy efficiencies that have prevented commercial development. The nickel phosphide catalyst class demonstrates a high potential to overcome these obstacles. Commercial application of electrochemical technologies require reaction rates three orders of magnitude larger than current research studies have shown, combined with high energy efficiencies and product selectivities. These goals can only be achieved by improving catalyst kinetics and optimizing the electrolyzer's mass transport. This development effort takes on the challenge of taking this process to high current densities and continuous operation in commercial CO2 reduction applications while minimizing the competing hydrogen formation reaction. Lastly, the electrolyzer design principles developed in this project are universal to this family of catalysts across many carbon products and are expected to further the field of carbon dioxide electrolyzer development more broadly.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
