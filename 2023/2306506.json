 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Fisk University seeks to strengthen the university's ability to recruit, retain, and graduate underrepresented students in STEM by adding a Biophysics minor to the existing degree programs. The program has the potential to offer a new pathway for life-science students to discover how quantitative methods can be applied to life-science applications of physics. \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of the project is to create a Biophysics minor program for STEM undergraduate students to gain an overview and applied knowledge of biophysics. The program is designed to present quantitative modeling and experimental techniques to a broad cross-section of life-science majors early in their academic careers. Two new courses will be launched, \u201cBiophysics and Physiological Modeling\u201d and \u201cExperimental Physics\u201d course, of both of which will be an extension of the introductory courses, yet broaden student knowledge in more complex systems including, osmosis, ligand binding and least-squares fits, diffusion using finite-difference computational methods, equilibrium distributions and entropy, energy and the Boltzmann factor, and the membrane voltage potential of transmembrane proteins. Professional development opportunities for students will be made available through the \u201cBiophysics Seminar\u201d course, where invited speakers will introduce students to current research topics in Biophysics research, as well as career opportunities. These activities, coupled with faculty mentor undergraduate research experiences, are anticipated to increase students\u2019 broad interests in STEM related fields, and more specifically biophysics, resulting enhancements in student self-efficacy, self-confidence, and career readiness in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
