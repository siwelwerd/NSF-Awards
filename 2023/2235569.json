 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by helping physics students develop deep conceptual and mathematical understanding of physical phenomena. This project is in the Engaged Student Learning track Level I. Decades of physics education research show that students struggle to connect complex physical phenomena to mathematical formalism, which can limit their opportunities to innovate.  Especially in advanced physics courses, these connections are dynamic: mathematical formalism can grow understanding of physical phenomena, and the complexity of physical phenomena can drive development of mathematical formalism.  This project will develop two specific software simulations for intermediate classical mechanics, a core physics course that is the first course to integrate high-level mathematics with physics.  These simulations -- called DynamicsLab -- will guide students in acquiring a deep conceptual understanding of both the mathematics and the physical representation of physical phenomena through linked, interactive visualizations of two physical phenomena and associated mathematical representations.  Additionally, this project will use design-based research to build deeper understanding of how to improve student learning of mathematics in physics contexts.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to iteratively develop, refine, and evaluate two interactive, browser-based, software simulations of mechanics concepts, specifically projectile motion with drag and the motion of a bead on a spinning hoop. The simulations are transformational in that they are the first to allow students to interactively explore the connections between the observed phenomenon and mathematical forms without requiring computer programming expertise. The simulation software will be developed through design-based research, supporting the iterative refinement of both the simulations and scientific understanding of how the design supports learning. Each of three iterations of the software will undergo usability testing through think-aloud interviews with individual users in order to refine the simulations and study their influence on student learning. Mixed-methods summative assessment will be conducted on the final version of the software using students enrolled in two intermediate mechanics courses. An additional aim is to investigate how students blend physical knowledge with mathematical form using analysis of the interviews and software log data through the lens of various epistemological frameworks. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
