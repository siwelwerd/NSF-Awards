 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's Indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions increases the opportunities for their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project at Nebraska Indian Community College (NICC) aligns with this goal through the development and delivery of the institution\u2019s first four-year STEM degree. Designed to specifically address Indigenous community contexts, students who complete the degree will possess a strong, multidisciplinary understanding of environmental problems, their impacts on human health and well-being, and solutions to manage those issues. Data compiled through a feasibility study indicate that workforce demand for this expertise and skill set is strong in NICC\u2019s region, providing significant career opportunities for graduates and contributing to the community\u2019s economic stability. The new Bachelor of Science in Indigenous Environmental Health will build on NICC\u2019s existing Associate of Science in General Science Studies.\r\n\r\nProject activities for developing and delivering this degree include curriculum design, hiring of additional faculty, equipping and enhancing additional STEM laboratories, and securing accreditations for the degree. The curriculum will include partnerships with Tribal elders and STEM professionals as students investigate local place-based environmental issues relevant to the Indigenous community. Core program requirements include the successful completion of a set of upper-level courses across health, environmental, and Indigenous science disciplines as well as the design and completion of both senior capstone and senior research projects. The delivery of this degree has the added significances of advancing NICC\u2019s STEM degree offerings to the baccalaureate level while providing culturally responsive career opportunities that will benefit its graduates and the community at large.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
