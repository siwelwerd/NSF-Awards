 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to potentially improve the quality of life for individuals suffering arm and hand impairments from stroke, through a medical device for telerehabilitation. Each year, ~800,000 people have a stroke in the United States, and about 65% of them suffer long-term upper extremity impairments. Due to many barriers such as cost, transportation, and time, many individuals do not obtain enough therapy for recovery. The telerehabilitation approach may reduce some of these barriers, allowing therapists and their patients to have meaningful remote sessions. For therapists, this may improve fiscal outcomes by automating the flow of reviewing patient progress, adjusting their rehabilitation treatments, and billing for services. \r\n \r\nThis project will advance the development of a personalized telerehabilitation system, specifically for hand and arm motor recovery, for individuals suffering from a stroke. New exergames designed for rehabilitation of the fingers, hand, and arm will be developed and added to the current library of games. Machine learning will be added to the system to create a versatile, engaging, and customizable solution. This novel approach to rehabilitation will personalize treatments that may be more effective by addressing individual user needs with predictive analytics. Machine learning will drive the recommendation system to synchronize the rehabilitation plan with the patient recovery trajectory. This synchronization will help the therapist provide personalized therapeutic exercises and possibly increase their patients\u2019 recovery outcomes. The games and machine learning algorithms will be evaluated with clinicians and individuals with stroke. The final step will be to test the feasibility of the system in a comprehensive stroke center. These capabilities of personalized virtual rehabilitation, remote clinician supervision, and progress tracking may offer a cost-effective way to improve patient outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
