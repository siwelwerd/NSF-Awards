 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF Regional Innovation Engines Development Award is focused on redefining resiliency for coastal regions, developing new technology to ensure resiliency for future generations, and catalyzing economic development based on innovation in the Caribbean. This project addresses the increased coastal vulnerability, increases resiliency and sustainability, and informs policy while transforming the region into a vibrant green economic zone focused on climate-related intellectual property, manufacturing, and workforce development. At the heart of the region of service, Puerto Rico serves as a \"living laboratory\" for exploration and data-driven innovation; with a history of infrastructure for manufacturing, a university system with eleven campuses, and key military bases, the island is an ideal location. Key partnerships in the region form a robust network of expertise, research capabilities, student exchange, and investment. The multi-disciplinary approach to research and innovation will build a significant ecosystem for discovery to address climate threats in the Caribbean and catalyze a new economy to meet the need for coastal resiliency. \r\n\r\nThe project's activities will be organized in six networks focused on facets of coastal vulnerability, including robust data collection, new designs to mitigate coastal erosion, increased biodiversity, renewable and sustainable energy, and policies to support resiliency. Each network will support the growth of four pillars (i) R & D on Coastal Resiliency for a better understanding of the variables of major hurricanes, climate change, and other factors, (ii) Innovation to drive employment, business start-up activity and an ownership economy, (iii) Workforce Development for a highly competitive, inclusive and diverse engineering workforce (leveraging micro-credentials in key strategic areas) related to resilient renewable energy, sustainable manufacturing, and federal contracting, as well as train first responders who can provide vital services, and (iv) Strategic Partnerships academic partners, industry groups, government entities, incubators and an existing will play critical roles in accelerating new technologies from the lab to the market. This project will promote technology transfer and the creation of new technologies related to sustainability and coastal resiliency based on the renewable energy-water nexus, microgrids, and data-driven system integration, seed cohorts of startups based on research outcomes and coordinate with regional and national early-stage investors and venture philanthropists committed to economic development in the region, ensuring maximum impact of research, supporting economic growth and expanding inclusion in the ownership economy--- and thus setting forward the path toward a full NSF Engine.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
