This meeting includes joint sessions that will allow discussion of topics of common interest and exploration of collaborative opportunities between the two NSF programs.\r\n \r\nThe meeting will consist of talks, panels, and discussions in breakout sessions with report-outs. Furthermore, all projects will prepare summaries of their work in posters and a short document in a prescribed format. These will be hosted on an open website. The activities in the meeting will be presented in a report delivered to NSF soon after the event. This report will include lessons from the current program and future implications identified at the meeting. It will also include a discussion of sustainability, best practices in cybertraining, approaches to broader impact/participation, metrics, and outcomes, identifying what succeeded and what was less successful. The meeting agenda will include identifying the community\u2019s needs to enable research workforce development and the gaps in coverage for future projects. It will also identify possible future collaborations, especially those with members of the Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
