The objective is to broaden the participation from graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, participants from underrepresented communities and women, and undergraduate students that aspire to learn more about the field of fracture and fatigue. Consideration in the selection process will be given to the inclusion of members of underrepresented groups, diversity of institutions that the participants represent, and diversity of programs within engineering. The aim is to grow the pipeline of US researchers interested in fracture and fatigue, which are topics that have applications in several fields including safety of mechanical, civil, and aerospace systems, improvements in health and quality of life, and homeland security.\r\n\r\nThe International Conference on Fracture is held quadrennially in different cities around the globe since ICF1 in 1965 in Sendai, Japan. It is considered the world\u2019s premier conference in the field of fracture in engineering materials and structures. Fracture in structural materials and components is a highly interdisciplinary topic and at the heart of the field of mechanics of materials, drawing upon researchers from mechanical, aerospace, biomedical, civil, materials engineering, and from the sciences. This conference brings together researchers from across the nation and internationally to share their research findings, foster and develop new collaborative ideas, and advance the professional development of a new generation of scientists and researchers to address problems where fracture impacts society. The conference will include 21 symposia across all areas of fracture where the most recent and novel research will be presented.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It has been held quadrennially in different cities around the globe since ICF1 in 1965 in Sendai, Japan. ICF15 was held in person in Atlanta, GA during the week of June 11-16, 2023. It was hosted jointly by Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA and University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR at a hotel in downtown Atlanta.\n\n\nFracture in structural materials and components is a highly interdisciplinary topic and at the heart of the field of mechanics of materials, drawing upon researchers from mechanical, aerospace, biomedical, civil, materials engineering, and from the sciences. The intellectual merit of the International Conference on Fracture stems from bringing together researchers from across the nation and internationally to share their research findings, foster and develop new collaborative ideas, and introduce the new generation of scientists and researchers to the vast range of problems where fracture impacts society. The week-long conference included 21 symposia across all areas of fracture where the most recent and novel research were presented. The conference promoted expanding the boundaries of the field that has widespread applications in safety of mechanical, civil, and aerospace systems, improvements in health and quality of life, and homeland security.\n\n\nThe primary objective of the award was to provide opportunities to young researchers, particularly those from diverse backgrounds, to attend the conference and interact with senior researchers and colleagues with the aim to grow the pipeline of US researchers working in this field. The award aimed to broaden our outreach to include larger participation from (a) US graduate students, (b) US postdoctoral fellows, (c) participants from underrepresented communities and women, and (d) US undergraduates that aspire to learn more about the field of fracture and fatigue. The award was used to pay registration fees of the selected participants to provide an opportunity for these participants to have a focused interaction with the international leaders in the fracture research community.\n\n\nAs an outcome of this award, the registration fees of 45 participants studying at US academic institutions or working at US National Labs were paid by the award. This included 32 PhD students, three MS students, three undergraduate students, and seven postdoctoral fellows. A poster session and mixer where senior fracture researchers were invited and specifically instructed to engage with the young researchers was held on Wednesday evening to further encourage communication between the young and senior researchers. This was a rare opportunity since the last ICF organized in the continental US was held in Houston, TX, in 1989, before most of the young researchers that the award supported were born.\n\n\nThe conference was successful in providing a boost for fracture-related research in the US and provided in-person opportunities to meet and network with colleagues around the globe. The supported participants were clearly impacted by ICF15 as expressed in the feedback received. Participants commented that the conference (i) was a great opportunity to share their work with the international fracture community, (ii) provided valuable insights into areas where new contributions can be made, (iii) provided a broader perspective on the wide-ranging applications of fracture mechanics that can impact society, (iv) helped the participants build networks both with their fellow peers as will as senior researchers from both US and international institutions, (v) enabled the participants to gain a better perspective on the field of fracture to facilitate ways to promote a long-lasting impact beyond the completion of their degree, (vi) helped build confidence as young researchers in presenting ideas, receiving constructive feedback, and advancing their ability to communicate to a broad range of audiences, and (vii) provided motivation toward future steps in their research.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/05/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RichardWNeu\n"
