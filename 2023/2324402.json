 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop ways to encourage access and broaden participation in research in higher education. The conference draws upon the topic of a culture of care. A focus on care reorients the research enterprise towards recognizing how institutions are made of systems and structures, as well as individuals. The goal is to find ways to enhance practices and processes that will facilitate the research opportunities of underrepresented researchers and ensure the U.S. remains competitive and agile in the face of global challenges.  \r\n\r\nThis conference is a partnership between a national professional society, the American Association of Geographers (AAG), an Emerging Research Institution, the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, (UCCS) and a research enterprise organization, the National Organization of Research Development Professionals (NORDP). Together, these organizations are well-positioned to catalyze scalable practices into diverse institutional and organizational contexts, especially at minority-serving and emerging research institutions. The conference will include three groups of participants: research enterprise professionals, leaders in institutions of higher education, and early career faculty. Participants will be placed in groups of 3 (or triads) with a member from each of the three groups. The triads will: 1) explore the lived experiences of researchers in navigating or supporting the research enterprise, and 2) recommend practices that are expected to broaden and strengthen the research enterprise workforce. The goal of the convening is to enable practitioners in the research enterprise field to encompass both knowledge discovery and critical reflection on the ethical, political, economic, and emotional aspects of research practice and knowledge production. Ultimately, the conference will offer opportunities to stretch horizons and expand the capacity of the research enterprise to enhance and improve science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

By prioritizing care, the project has created a sustainable framework for long-term improvements in research. The foundational paper developed from the convening captures insights and recommendations of participants, ensuring that these co-created efforts continue to influence research practices. The focus on the ethical and emotional dimensions of research has sparked broader conversations about how to structure research opportunities in more supportive and inclusive ways. These efforts are expected to lead to lasting changes in mentoring structures, funding accessibility, and institutional policies, better supporting researchers throughout their careers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Anticipated Future Actions</strong></p>\r\n<p>The project will focus on continued dissemination of the foundational paper and expanding the reach of the Ethos of Care Credential. Feedback from post-convening surveys will be used to refine the curriculum, and the project will explore continued collaboration and future partnerships with institutions and organizations to ensure the sustainability of the project.
