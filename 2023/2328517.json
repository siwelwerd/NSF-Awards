 "awd_abstract_narration": "After 18 months of public meetings and deliberation, the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) Task Force fulfilled its Congressional mandate, unanimously approving a guide to the policy and practical aspects of building a national resource for AI research. This process has been deliberative and included a wide range of stakeholders in considering an effective and equitable method of making resources for AI research -- including computing power, data, toolkits, and more -- available to a broader universe of researchers. With the advent of modern AI, this form of collaborative yet broadened investment has been deemed necessary by Congress and the Administration, and presents a necessary step forward to grow the U.S. scientific enterprise. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this workshop is to explore the findings of the National AI Research Resource Task Force's final report with a diverse group of stakeholders from the broader ecosystem, and to then determine practical next steps to begin building such a resource using existing and future mechanisms. In addition to the diverse cohort of attendees, a recorded live stream subsequent reporting will further disseminate workshop outcomes to the public.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
