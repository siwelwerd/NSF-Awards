 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project aims to develop and implement new statistical methodology for the detection and mapping of various aspects of delays and bandwidth quality in computer networks.  Part I of the project will develop the so-called extreme delay tomography, where network links experiencing extreme delays or congestion will be identified. The goal is to do so by using only end-to-end measurements from the perimeter of the network without observing all links directly. Part II of the project will focus on combining multiple data sets and measurements to build a state-wide and potentially nation-wide map(s) of broadband accessibility at the resolution of a US-census block. \r\n\r\nThe project brings together researchers from the University of Michigan, the University of California, Los Angeles, and Merit Network, with expertise in network tomography, statistics of extremes, and network measurement research.  One core goal is to utilize and develop new theory on statistics of extremes that can be used to detect and identify anomalous delays in the network from end-to-end delay measurements. This will expand the fields of statistics, network tomography, and provide novel tools for situational awareness and quality of service. The second core activity of the project will contribute new statistical methodology for integrating multiple observational data sets with existing demographic covariates for the purpose of mapping broadband access. This research activity will contribute to the fields of data integration and transfer learning.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project will be manifold. The direct impact of the research will be on: (i) Developing novel practical tools for network situational awareness and security; (ii) Mapping the broadband availability that will aid in understanding and identifying priority goals for public policy and also in addressing social disparities due to the broadband gap; (iii) The project will engage graduate and undergraduate students and thus contribute to training of the next generation of network measurement researchers and statisticians. The outcomes of the project will have a broader impact on the fields of statistics and network measurement research through novel theoretical, methodological, and algorithmic developments, data products and software.  The latter will be disseminated to the broader research communities through journal publications, conference presentations and open-source software.\r\n\r\nAn account of the research goals, achievements, and landmarks will be made publicly available on https://www.merit.edu/initiatives/#activeresearchprojects. This address will maintain pointers to data products, research reports, presentations, and events related to the sponsored research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
