 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a nanofiber cloth to filter carcinogenic chemicals such as formaldehyde when used in face masks. The innovation can be adapted for other airborne carcinogenic chemicals (e.g., benzene, toluene, and ammonia) detection and prevention. This innovation will have commercial and societal benefits and applications for various industries, including health, education, and fuel delivery. The project's interdisciplinary nature will advance electrospun nanotechnology, material characterization, and experimental techniques.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a filter fabric for a facemask or air filter, which will absorb airborne formaldehyde and pathogens, preventing human exposure. This project will use an electrospun nanofiber mesh technology to produce a unique, biofriendly fabric incorporating formaldehyde absorption and antibacterial agents. This fabric will be capable of filtering out airborne pathogenic molecules less than 120 nm. Electrospinning is an engineering process by which threads 1000 times less than a spider web can be processed into a non-woven fabric. The nanofibers have been used to coat implants (e.g., dental, knee, and bone anchor) and produce antibacterial bandages, bones, skin grafts, and intervertebral discs. The outcome of this project is an improved, cost-effective, and bio-friendly filtration material and production technology that will impact human health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
