 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to support students\u2019 participation in the 54th North American Power Symposium (NAPS), which was held at the University of Utah, during October 9-11, 2022. NAPS is a student-centric conference that brings together students, faculty, and researchers from the industry and national laboratories, in the power and energy systems area. The purpose of this symposium is to provide a forum for students, faculty, and industrial representatives to discuss the latest research ideas and findings and receive feedback from their peers. The requested funding will be used to cover part of the travel expenses, including meals, lodging for two nights, and discounted registration, for 50 students from US Universities. To promote student participation, regardless of financial status, NAPS will provide free lodging and discounted registration for students. NAPS is technically co-sponsored by IEEE Power and Energy Society, and the conference proceedings will be published through IEEE Xplore.\r\n\r\nThe NSF support for NAPS 2022 will boost awareness about issues related to the power and energy system, including decarbonization, resilience, and energy justice. The support will also provide a unique learning opportunity for the students in the STEM community by subsidizing their participation in NAPS.  The students are expected to receive feedback from their peers and the faculty participants, learn from their peers and connect with potential employers. Finally, support for NAPS will have a positive impact on the power and energy research community in the United States, as they work towards the nation\u2019s energy and climate goals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
