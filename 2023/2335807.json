 "awd_abstract_narration": "The metaverse refers to a computer-generated virtual space where users can interact with one another in real-time. It uses different technologies and platforms, allowing for widespread integration into various aspects of our lives. However, it also brings up a range of security and privacy threats. Although the metaverse is envisioned as the evolution of social media platforms, the metaverse blurs the boundaries between physical and virtual identities and incorporates virtual economies, creating unique security challenges like virtual crimes, theft, and fraudulent transactions. Teenagers, due to their vulnerable developmental stage, lack of experience, and technological fluency, are at risk for online scams, cyberbullying, and identity theft within the metaverse. The project team will develop metaverse-native security and privacy curricula. The developed curricula will assume a crucial role, akin to defensive driving courses, in preparation for entering the metaverse. Although participating may not eliminate all potential \"accidents,\" it will significantly reduce them and minimize the impact on teenagers\u2019 safety and privacy. Moreover, by involving students from communities currently underrepresented in cybersecurity in the design and development of the metaverse-native security and privacy curricula, we can foster their interest in the field of cybersecurity and ensure that the curricula are meaningful to their peers. This collaborative approach contributes to strengthening the national cybersecurity workforce pipeline. Additionally, the research instruments, assessment tools, and outcomes of this work will be disseminated through workshops, publications, presentations, and a web portal. By sharing knowledge and insights, we can promote awareness and empower individuals to navigate the metaverse safely and securely. \r\n\r\nThe project has two interconnected goals: to educate teenagers about the unique security and privacy challenges in the metaverse and to inspire them to pursue cybersecurity-related majors in college and subsequent careers in the field. To accomplish these objectives, the project team will collaborate with high school students to identify metaverse-specific security and privacy threat scenarios. Through their participation, we will design and develop metaverse-native security and privacy curricula. These curricula will be piloted with their high school cohort to evaluate their effectiveness and refine their content. The project will make significant contributions to cybersecurity education and workforce development, yielding several key outcomes. First, the team will create a set of prototyped metaverse cybersecurity scenarios designed to engage and motivate high school students. Second, the team will develop and document principles for iterative co-development with youth. Lastly, the team will produce materials that enable the monitoring and assessment of student learning and interest in cybersecurity. The project will conduct ongoing research and comprehensive formative and summative evaluations to gain insights and lessons learned, further advancing cybersecurity education in high schools. \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
