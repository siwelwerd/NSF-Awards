The project aims to aims to provide undergraduate and graduate students in the University of Nebraska\u2019s Radar Meteorology course an opportunity to use a research radar to collect data for small student-driven research projects; improve scientific literacy of students in a large-enrollment general-education meteorology course; and exhibit the DOW facility to local K-12 students. \r\n\r\nThe project will enable integration of field-based research experience into the course curriculum and advance student understanding of weather radar theory and application. The project will also contribute to the development of a globally competitive science, technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) workforce and improved STEM education by providing an educational opportunity that enables students to gain experience and professional skills in radar meteorology, field-program design and execution, scientific data collection and analysis, and scientific communication.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe 2023 University of Nebraska DOW Education and Outreach (UNDEO-2023) project was an 8-day educational deployment of a Doppler on Wheels mobile radar conducted in the spring of 2023 and based out of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The principal objectives of UNDEO-2023 were as follows:\n\nProvide undergraduate and graduate students in the University of Nebraskas Radar Meteorology course an opportunity to use a research radar to collect data for micro research projects;\nImprove scientific literacy by giving students in a general-education meteorology course opportunities to learn about the scientific method and see examples of its application;\nExhibit a valuable NSF-supported facility to local K-12 students.\n\n\n\nDuring UNDEO-2023 the 9 students in Radar Meteorology deployed DOW-6 near Parkdale, AR where data on severe thunderstorms were collected, 70 students in Weather and Climate, a general-education course at UNL, were provided opportunities to increase their scientific literacy, and the DOW was exhibited to 193 high school students in the Lincoln Public School system.\n\n\nOverall, evaluation scores of UNDEO-2023 by Radar Meteorology students were as good if not better than the mean of the previous 6 UNDEO projects. Weather and Climate students found that the educational component contributed to their understanding of basic concepts related to weather radars and the scientific method.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/02/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AdamLHouston\n"
