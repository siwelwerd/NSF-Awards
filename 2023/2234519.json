 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an individual security biometric-based access technique. The proposed commercial market is cars and device access while the proposed technology solves the problem of losing a car key, and of having a lost or stolen phone accessed by the wrong person. Currently, $2.7 billion is spent annually in the U.S. replacing lost items. Phones and car keys are in the top five lost items. In addition, cars may be stolen if those items are used by other users, but using the proposed solution car theft may be prevented. Another potential application includes building access. Identification (ID) cards are used commonly to control access to buildings. However, companies spend thousands of dollars each year to replace lost ID cards, which may be mitigated by using the proposed technology. In addition, the proposed touchless technology may be useful to reduce the spread and costs associated with COVID-19 and other highly transmissible diseases. \r\n \r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a biometric authentication method. Facial and fingerprint recognition have become popular methods in the biometric authentication market.  The proposed technology is a photoplethysmography (PPG)-based authentication solution using signal processing and machine learning algorithms that can gather physiological data by using integrated sensors on smartphones. It is a touchless monitoring method to measure data and does not require additional hardware to recognize users.  Current biometric authentication solutions, including facial recognition and physical fingerprint, require external hardware components that may limit use and raise privacy concerns as well as the need for contact monitoring, and expensive investments for manufacturers.  The proposed touchless biometric-based authentication solution may cost less, protect user privacy, and eliminate touch points to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
