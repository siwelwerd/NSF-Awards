 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators in this project will conduct laboratory and theoretical research to advance our understanding of the atmospheric chemistry of isoprene, which is emitted by plants and can lead to the formation of atmospheric ozone and aerosol. This work seeks to specifically study the pathways that cause isoprene to form secondary aerosol in order to improve atmospheric chemistry models and allow us to better address pressing air quality issues. The research will expand our understanding of atmospheric chemistry and train new undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe research team seeks to determine the structure of yet-to-be verified early-generation oxidation products of isoprene, the secondary organic aerosol compounds that subsequently form, and to characterize these oxidation products and their ultimate chemical fate. To address these challenges, this project team has identified three specific research aims: (1) the refinement of protocols for the analysis of isoprene secondary organic aerosols; (2) the characterization of gas-phase oxidation products of re-volatilized multiphase chemical products; and (3) the confirmation of these early-generation gas-phase oxidation products and their secondary organic aerosol forming potentials. This work will support and train undergraduate and graduate students and could potentially advance atmospheric chemistry and climate models, which could subsequently be used to inform pollution control strategies and air quality policies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
