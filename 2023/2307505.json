 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project from the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute (BAERI) and the University of Alabama, Huntsville seeks analyze observations of sunspots from National Science Foundation\u2019s (NSF\u2019s) Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST). This highest ever-resolution data in different wavelengths offers a unique opportunity to explore dynamics of jets and dots in sunspots. Improving understanding of fine-scale dynamics in the strongest magnetic field regions on our nearest star, the Sun, has broad social impact. Large scale features such as coronal jets and coronal mass ejections, which are responsible for space weather. Small-scale features, such as those examined in this study, have some similarities to large scale structures, but also contribute to the complexity of the solar environment. The broader impacts of this project include training REU students, and high school interns, who will not only be introduced to solar physics research but can also get motivated to pursue a career in any science. The proposed work will also increase the partnership between three institutions, BAERI, University of Alabama, Huntsville, and the National Solar Observatory.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project seeks to utilize data from Hinode\u2019s Solar Optical Telescope, NASA\u2019s Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and DKIST in combination with MHD simulations of sunspot penubrae to (i) understand the mechanisms that generate jets and bright dots in and around sunspot penumbrae, (ii) investigate to what extent penumbral jets contribute to transition region and coronal heating, and (iii) investigate whether penumbral jets have mixed-polarity field at their base, and whether they spin, similar to X-ray jets.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
