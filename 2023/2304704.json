 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Moab Topology Conference, which will be held May 1-3, 2023 at Utah State University's Regional Campus in Moab, Utah. The goal of the conference is to integrate research and education between students and established researchers in the field of topology. Topology is a fundamental field in mathematics with well-forged connections to many scientific fields, including physics, engineering, and data science. The organizers will achieve this goal by planning a mix of expository, research, and student talks together with informal discussion sessions and a career development panel. Speakers and participants will represent a diverse range of institutions, geographic regions, and career stages.\r\n\r\nThe conference will focus on recent developments in various subfields of geometric and quantum topology and their related representation theory. The plenary speakers are Thang Le (Georgia Institute of Technology, quantum groups in low dimensional topology), Ina Petkova (Dartmouth College, Heegaard Floer homology), and Lisa Piccirillo (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, topology of 3- and 4-manifolds). Each plenary speaker will deliver one introductory lecture and one research lecture. The remaining talks will be delivered by early-career mathematicians, including graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The conference website is https://www.usu.edu/math/geer/conference2023/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
