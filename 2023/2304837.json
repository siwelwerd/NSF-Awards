 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program in the Division of Chemistry, and partial co-funding from the Environmental Chemical Sciences and the Environmental Engineering programs, the groups of Francisco Fernandez-Lima and Fahad Saeed at Florida International University are developing new analytical detection and processing tools for the analysis of complex mixtures, with a focus on dissolved organic matter (DOM). DOM is the fundamental source of bioavailable carbon transported from terrestrial environments to aquatic ecosystems and plays a crucial ecological role as a source of nutrients for aquatic microorganisms, as protection for aquatic organisms by controlling light penetration, and as a medium to mobilize metals and aquatic contaminants. Using newly devised analytical protocols, the project is addressing long-standing basic DOM science/environmental questions and providing a data resource for the research community. The project outreach program \u2013 FIUMASS - seeks to enhance learning and exposure to modern analytical techniques for students (including those underrepresented in science) in partnership with local community colleges.\r\n\r\nThe team aims to develop and integrate complementary, multidimensional analytical separations and data processing tools for the characterization of complex mixtures at the molecular structural level, with a focus on dissolved organic matter (DOM). To this end, a platform combining tandem ion mobility spectrometry and ultra-high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (IMSn-FT-ICR MSn) is being developed, along with data acquisition, processing, and visualization tools. The existing FIUMASS educational and outreach program is being expanded to include offerings related to \u201cFollowing Environmental Transformations at the Molecular Level.\u201d The program\u2019s multi-level approach integrates seminar series, curriculum development activities at the undergraduate and graduate level, laboratory open-house events, hands-on MS experiences, and MS visual experiments and summer internships for students from underrepresented minorities (URM). Working synergistically with local community colleges and URM minority programs at FIU, this plan seeks to enhance learning and exposure to the modern MS techniques and to recruit URM students into STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
