 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create reusable satellites that can refuel directly from the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. These satellites will have two key advantages over the existing satellites. First, they will fly significantly lower than current satellites providing superior Earth Observation and satellite broadband communication quality. Second, they will enable refuellable space tugs that can perform a servicing mission and then descend into the atmosphere to refuel. Furthermore, by flying in these low orbits, satellites will naturally de-orbit at the end of life and leave orbits uncluttered. Finally, the proposed space tugs will reduce the need for powerful chemical rockets (for both launch and in-space maneuvers). \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to investigate satellite air-breathing electric propulsion. While technologies necessary to enable air-breathing electric propulsion have been maturing for the last few decades, a viable system has not yet been demonstrated. This project will address the last remaining technological gap to enable a viable air-breathing electric propulsion system that will unlock access to ultra-low Earth orbits (ULEO), between 200 km and 300 km. The propulsion system consists of an electric propulsion thruster, such as a Hall Effect Thruster (HET) and an air-scoop that collects atmospheric air. This proposed project presents the first step in developing such a system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
