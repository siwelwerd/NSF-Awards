 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to bring new and more diverse audiences to circuit design and digital fabrication through an integrated STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and math) approach.  Research shows that the STEAM approach is especially successful for reaching underrepresented minorities, girls, and women. This project continues the development of the Phase I circuit design software and accompanying physical toolkit for do-it-yourself (DIY) digital fabrication of circuits on paper. Through the design, development, and evaluation of this toolkit, the team will contribute to the scientific understanding of human computer interaction design for STEAM learning. By introducing the novel category of technology-integrated crafts to mainstream education and craft markets, open market opportunities create a new ecosystem of products and accessories, customers, and inventors. This innovation brings the digital manufacturing of electronics out of traditional technical environments and into entirely new, more mainstream, and more diverse audiences.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the development of the Phase I activities towards commercial deployment. The team is developing a novel electronics design software that greatly reduces the complexity of existing computer-aided design tools and prepares a custom toolkit optimized for the do-it-yourself digital fabrication of circuits. The research objective is to blend engineering activities with arts and crafts in innovative ways to radically reduce the barriers to entry for learning, designing, and producing electronic circuits. The team will develop a production version of their software that includes advanced simulation and design features, as well as a library of projects and resources to scaffold the circuit learning and design process. The team will also refine and manufacture the toolkit for user testing and deployment at scale. In close partnership with K-12 educators and hobby crafters, the technology will be developed to meet the needs of target users.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
