 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the REU site \"Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Industrial Mathematics and Statistics at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.\" Twelve students per year will participate in a 9 week summer REU program. The program provides participants with a distinctive educational experience in the mathematical sciences by introducing them to the ways in which mathematicians and statisticians use mathematics outside of the academic environment. Students work in teams on two to three research problems of industrial and mathematical significance; these problems are provided directly from industry and are of immediate interest to the companies affiliated with the program. Students coordinate with company representatives to define the problem and to develop solutions. They work closely with faculty advisors to maintain a clear focus on the mathematics and statistics at the core of the project. This summer research program involves challenges not faced in traditional undergraduate programs and engages participants with some of the many career possibilities open to students with a strong mathematical background.\r\n\r\nParticipants in this industry-focused REU program begin by developing a project goals statement, in consultation with a faculty advisor and a company liaison. Over the course of the summer, students conduct the actual research while presenting their progress to both an academic audience at the host institution and a corporate audience at the sponsoring company. During the final week of the program, students give an oral presentation in both settings and submit a final written report. Professional development activities presenting mathematical career options in academia and industry complement the research program. The selection process focuses on students with a strong academic background but with limited opportunities for research in mathematics at their home institutions. One emphasis in the selection process is an openness to pursue a range of research directions consistent with the nature of an industry-inspired research problem.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
