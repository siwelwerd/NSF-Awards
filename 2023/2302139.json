 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CombinaTexas 2023 conference will be held at Texas A&M University, College Station TX on April 22-23, 2023. The conference will feature six fifty-minute plenary lectures and a number of contributed talks in various areas of Combinatorics and Graph Theory. The aim of the CombinaTexas conference series is to enhance the educational and research atmosphere of combinatorialists in Texas and the surrounding states, increase communication between mathematicians of the region, and provide a forum for presentation and discussion of the most recent developments in the field of Combinatorics. Ever since Texas A&M University hosted the first conference in 2000, it has been held almost every year at different institutions in the South Central United States. CombinaTexas 2023 is the nineteenth conference in this series.\r\n\r\nThe topics of the CombinaTexas Series include all branches of Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and their connections to Algebra, Geometry, Probability Theory, and Computer Science. In 2023 the confirmed plenary speakers are Sergi Elizalde (Dartmouth College), Patricia Klein (Texas A&M University), Bernard Lidicky (Iowa State University), Jesus de Loera (University of California Davis), Andrew Suk (University of California San Diego), Sheila Sundaram (Independent). They will cover topics in Algebraic Combinatorics, Combinatorial Representation Theory, Commutative Algebra, Discrete Geometry and Ramsey theory, Extremal Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Combinatorial Algorithms, and Computational Applied Mathematics. About 70 participants are anticipated, with estimated 20 contributed talks in parallel sessions. More information about the conference will be available at the webpage https://www.math.tamu.edu/conferences/combinatexas/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
