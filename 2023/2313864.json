 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Miami proposes to provide fleetwide operational support for the various X-band radars that exist in the Academic Research Fleet (ARF). Although this proposal was submitted to the Oceanographic Instrumentation Program, it will be considered under Oceanographic Technical Services (OTS) which is more appropriate. There are salaries involved, and the proposal follows the model of centers of expertise throughout the fleet that provide specialized support for a particular discipline (e.g., ADCP, MAC, R2R, etc.). All these centers are funded through OTS. This is a proposal for a 3-year continuing grant. The Program will recommend the initiation of a pilot program to pursue the goals outlined in the proposal. Continued support for Armstrong and the addition of Sikuliaq to the project are the starting points. The goal is ultimately to expand the support to all vessels in the ARF that have these radars. The first year will be recommended at proposed levels. It will be a 3-year continuing grant with the outyear funding being negotiated with the Program based on the receipt of the annual report. The Program recommends an award of $292,547 for the first year.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
