 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal provides travel support for 13 promising graduate and undergraduate students to attend the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP 2023), co-located with the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Conference on Collective Intelligence (CI). HCOMP and CI are cross-disciplinary conferences that combine human-centered methods and traditional computer science to address fundamental questions in human computation and crowdsourcing systems, which typically aggregate many small contributions to accomplish larger tasks such as information extraction from images, labeling data for use by both AI algorithms and qualitative researchers, and running surveys and experiments with many participants. The funding will be used to support students who might not otherwise be able to afford the conference, but who would benefit from interacting with experts in the field, gaining feedback on their research ideas, and forming connections with peers. Supported PhD students will also be able to participate in the Doctoral Consortium to gain expert insights on their dissertation work.\r\n\r\nBoth undergraduate and graduate students may apply for conference travel funding to allow for students at all career stages to share their work, form professional connections, and engage with current research in HCOMP and CI. Selection criteria will include students\u2019 research interests specific to the conferences, prior attendance at these conferences, having a paper or poster accepted at this year's conferences, and the potential for conference attendance to be a transformative experience. The proposers will also coordinate with the HCOMP doctoral consortium committee to select for a diversity of institutional, student, and topical backgrounds, which will provide both a necessary breadth of research expertise as well as opportunities for building new collaborations and including students from groups that are historically underrepresented in computing. Students will be able to attend both conferences, further increasing their exposure to a wide set of research ideas and approaches.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
