 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of U.S.-based mathematicians in the international conference \u201cHarmonic Analysis, Partial Differential Equations, and Geometric Measure Theory in Bilbao 2023\u201d, to be held at Bizkaia Aretoa, a conference center in Bilbao, Basque Country, Spain, June 12--16, 2023.  The conference will bring together experts in the subjects of harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, and partial differential equations to foster the exchange of ideas and to disseminate the latest research. The inclusion of U.S.-based researchers in this event will promote and facilitate the ongoing engagement of the U.S. research community with its global counterparts.\r\n\r\nThe conference will focus on recent developments in three areas: harmonic analysis (including singular integrals, restriction theory, and decoupling theory), partial differential equations (including boundary value problems, elliptic and parabolic equations, and dispersive equations), and geometric measure theory (including rectifiability, fractal and combinatorial geometry, and area minimizing currents). A particular focus of the event will lie on the mutual interactions amongst these fields. The conference will especially benefit early-career researchers, as it will provide ample opportunities for dialogue and the fostering of new international collaborations and partnerships.\r\n\r\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/hapdegmt-bilbao-2023?pli=1\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
