 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2023 Molecular Genetics of Bacteria and Phages Conference will be held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison from August 7-11, 2023. The \u201cPhage\u201d meeting is the oldest scientific meeting focused on the molecular biology of bacteria and their phages, originating in the 1940\u2019s at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) and continuing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison since 2009. The Phage meeting is an exciting forum for presentation and discussion of the latest advances in modern molecular biology of bacteria and bacteriophages across many disciplines, including genetics, molecular and cell biology, developmental biology, physiology, immunology, evolution and ecology, and biotechnology, among others. The rich diversity of topics and disciplines provides ample opportunities for cross disciplinary exchange of scientific ideas among researchers from diverse backgrounds and career stages. In 2022, the Phage meeting had 475 attendees representing 35 US states and 13 countries, and the same is expected for the 2023 meeting. The program includes seminars (>70% chosen from submitted abstracts) and poster sessions, as well as mentoring sessions for discussion of career paths, inclusivity, and diversity, the Sternberg Thesis Award for the most outstanding PhD thesis on bacterial or phage molecular genetics, trainee poster awards and community building events including the Hatch Echols 5K fun run.\r\n\r\nThe rigor and inclusivity of the scientific program of the Phage meeting, the focus on increasing the diversity of trainees, and the opportunities for interaction will positively impact the broad field of research on bacteria and their viruses, while providing numerous opportunities for trainees to present their work and start building their scientific network and career.\r\n\r\nThis meeting is supported by the Genetic Mechanisms and Systems and Synthetic Biology programs (Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences) and the Symbiosis, Infection, and Immunity program (Division of Integrative Organismal Systems) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
