 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for students to participate in the Twentieth Summer School on Exotic Beam (EBSS) Physics at Michigan State University, July 6 - 10, 2023. The school is designed for graduate students, senior undergraduate students who are actively involved in research and postdocs (within 2 years of their degree). The school will consist of morning lectures and hands-on activities in the afternoons. Students will also have an opportunity to present their research. The aim of the summer school is to educate the next generation of scientists who will drive the research at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) when it comes online and other existing rare isotope facilities. In years to come, substantial progress in low-energy nuclear physics will have a broad impact on society, ranging from our understanding of the origin of the elements to the enhancement of national security. \r\n\r\nPrevious sessions of these summer schools have had broad participation of under-represented minorities, with approximately 30% of the participants of the previous four summer schools being female. The organizers of the Eighteenth EBSS will continue the use of accepted best practices to increase diversity and have an inclusive summer school\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
