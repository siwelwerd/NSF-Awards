The conference program features talks on a variety CRISPR-related subjects, including CRISPR\u2019s applications in synthetic biology, genome editing technologies, and epigenetic and RNA editing. The conference covers a broad range of research areas and applications of CRISPR technology, which creates a unique environment for people with diverse expertise to gather and exchange information. Additionally, the conference aims to give students and early career professionals opportunities to share their work, to network with the foremost leaders in the field, and to develop their careers.\r\n\r\nThe field of genome editing with CRISPR technologies is one of the fastest growing and highest impact areas of modern research, with applications in agriculture, ecology and medicine. The 2023 International Conference on CRISPR Technologies (ICCT) will bring together biologists, chemists, and engineers to discuss CRISPR\u2019s ability to address fundamental and applied problems. The sessions feature a broad range of emerging technologies and a diverse set of topics that will impact the next decade of research. ICCT is designed to bring together researchers and experts from academia, government and industry in a highly interactive and engaging meeting. Early career and established researchers will have opportunities to interact during organized talks, poster sessions, panels, and many informal gatherings. This platform will allow established and early career scientists to discuss challenges in the field and to establish collaborations to address these challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
