 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing 2023 (ACM HPDC \u201823) is a premier forum for presenting the latest research findings on the design and use of parallel and distributed systems for high-end computing, collaboration, data analysis, and other innovative applications. Conference attendance is a critical component of training and professional development for Ph.D. students in these study areas. Students trained in these areas take careers crucial for supporting the development, maintenance, and improvement of US public and private cyber infrastructure. This project helps fund the travel of eligible students from US institutions of higher learning to HPDC \u201823. This support is distributed through travel grants based on financial need and application merit to domestic Ph.D. students in high-performance, parallel, and distributed computing domains. \r\n\r\nWe will provide 10-20 student travel grants to support student registration and travel. The travel grant co-chairs, together with a selection of PC members, will prioritize students based on several factors: financial need (particularly in the case of student authors of accepted or submitted papers), stage of their education (early-year graduate students will be preferred), the fit in terms of technical interests, and institutional and individual diversity. The committee will document the applications received and how the selection criteria were applied to each of the applications. Our travel grant report will be shared with the conference organizers of 2023 and the subsequent years.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
