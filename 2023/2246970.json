 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animal cells respond to mechanical forces both in health and during mechanically caused diseases. The forces change cell signaling through a process known as mechanotransduction. Mechanical forces are known to influence fundamental cellular and tissue level functions, but the cellular sites for mechanotransduction remain poorly understood. The nucleus is the largest and perhaps most critical structure of a mammalian cell since most of the DNA is stored there. Proteins located on the outside of the nucleus experience mechanical force, and the nucleus can be seen deforming when a cell is loaded. Deformation of the nucleus by forces suggests that the nucleus could be a site for mechanotransduction. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program research project will determine how and when the nucleus experiences mechanical force using a new kind of force transducer, and then determine how these forces regulate cellular functions. These studies have the potential to identify a new fundamental mechanism of mechanotransduction that would be present in all animals cells. Research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to engage in interdisciplinary research projects are planned, as well as K-12 outreach activities, and using research results to improved graduate engineering education.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus is directly connected to the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton by a group of proteins that form the LINC (linker of nucleoskeleton to cytoskeleton) complex. Mutations in LINC complex proteins are associated with impaired development, human genetic diseases, and cancer; thus the linkage of the cytoskeleton to the nucleus appears to be essential to cell function and homeostasis. Proteins in the LINC complex experience mechanical force, suggesting that the LINC complex could be an important structure for mechanotransduction. The goal of this CAREER project is to develop novel force biosensors for LINC complex proteins nesprin and SUN, and then use these sensors to study the mechanical and force-dependent biochemical processes associated with the LINC complex. Identification of the relationship between nuclear force and the forces on the outside of the cell will provide a better understanding of how forces are transmitted within a cell, helping to validate or advance theories of cellular biomechanics. Additionally, the force biosensors used in this project are expressed with plasmid DNA and imaged using fluorescent microscopy, allowing for other laboratories to adopt this force measurement technique",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis NSF CAREER grant was used to support a research project studying cellular mechanics and mechanobiology. Specifically this research was focused on understanding how mechanical forces are transduced onto the nucleus and how these forces regulate fundamental cellular processes.\n\n\nA major outcome of this award was an improved understanding of the factors that contribute to nuclear forces. This includes externally applied mechanical forces to the outside of cells, actomyosin contractility, and chromatin condensation.\n\n\nA second major outcome of this award was an understanding of how the nuclear LINC complex, a critical protein structure, maintains cellular homeostasis. Although the nuclear LINC complex is conserved from single cell organisms (e.g. yeast) to plants to mammalian cells, its functional role in cells is not fully understood. Through careful studies we were able to show that the LINC complex is required for cells to adapt to mechanical perturbations, using endothelial cell mechanoadapation to fluid shear stress. Additionally, we showed that loss of the LINC complex leads to increased cellular contractility and can result in an eversion of apical-basal polarity in epithelial spheroids, in which the cells flip inside-out.\n\n\nA third outcome of this work was looking at how other factors beyond the LINC complex, influence mechanoadapation of cells to forces. Specifically we observed that nuclear lamin stiffening, as well as chromatin condensation can both prevent adaptation of endothelial cells to fluid shear stress.\n\n\nA final outcome of this work was the development of new biosensors for measuring mechanical forces on nuclear lamins. These new biosensors were based on lamin A/C nanobodies and were able to show that a nanobody-based biosensor can be used to measure strains across complex, filamentous protein networks. In our first year since publishing these new sensors, we have distributed these new sensors to over a dozen labs, which indicates that these sensors are being rapidly adopted by the broader scientific community. We are also developing new nanobody-based sensors to study other important protein networks, such as the actin, vimentin, and keratin cytoskeletal networks.\n\n\nThe broader impacts of this award include the additional information regarding the importance of nuclear to cytoskeletal mechanical connections through the LINC complex. Broader impacts to society include the training of one graduate student, who recently defended their thesis and is applying to jobs in industry. Several undergraduates have been supported by this research project as well, and they have all graduated and taken positions in medical school, graduate school, or obtained research-related jobs in industry. Research as part of this proposal also was used in undergraduate and graduate education at two different academic institutions.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DanielConway\n"
