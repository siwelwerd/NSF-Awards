 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from this grant, SIAM Interdisciplinary Conferences in Applied and Computational Mathematics, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will organize and run a series of conferences and workshops in the mathematical and computational sciences. These SIAM conferences form an important part of the research, education, and technology transfer infrastructure for the mathematical and computational sciences. SIAM conferences and workshops provide a welcoming environment for scientists and engineers to establish the collaborations that are required for interdisciplinary research. The funding from this grant will support travel of students, early career professionals and invited speakers to the conferences, and video capture and dissemination of key conference presentations.\r\n \r\n\r\nSIAM conferences and workshops are highly interdisciplinary and foster the communication of the latest fundamental and applied research and applications to mathematical and computational scientists, physical and social scientists, and engineers from academia, industry, and government. SIAM conferences are designed to identify and disseminate knowledge of emerging areas of research. A sampling of conferences to be held during the award period include those on the following topics: Computational Science and Engineering, Financial Mathematics and Engineering, Imaging Science, Life Sciences, Mathematical Aspects of Material Science, Mathematics of Data Science, and Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
