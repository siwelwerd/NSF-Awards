 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide travel support for junior investigators to attend the Workshop on Musculoskeletal Biology at the 50th Annual Meeting of the Orthopedic Research Society (ORS); Midway, Utah; 22-27 July 2023. This workshop promotes interdisciplinary communication among biologists, engineers, and clinicians in the area of musculoskeletal biology, biomechanics and mechanobiology; stimulates interactions among investigators in all levels in their careers; builds for-life scientific networks; emphasizes active participation of junior faculty and students; and is unique in that discussion time equals or exceeds time allotted for presentations. The focus of the workshop is broad and highly multidisciplinary. Sessions address significant current problems, limitations, potential solutions, and approaches applicable to both basic science and clinical. The attendance of this Workshop represents a significant number of students, young investigators, women, and underrepresented minorities. Partnership with the ORS provides maximum visibility through broadcast emails and links on the ORS website, where abstracts will be posted.\r\n\r\nThe scientific theme of the 2023 workshop is \"Musculoskeletal cells: identity, targeting, stimulation, and manipulation for therapeutic gain.\" Sessions will address significant current problems, limitations and potential solutions, and approaches applicable to both clinical and basic science. The Plenary Lecture \u201cRemodeling in Bone\u201d (RIB) is entitled \u201cBone mechanobiology: harnessing the power of skeletal loads.\u201d Six scientific sessions will cover (1) New insights into osteoarthritis pathogenesis from single-cell -omic technologies; (2) Skeletal stem/progenitor cells; (3) Imaging mechanobiology at work; (4) Osteoclasts: origin and fate; (5) Connective tissue targeting: delivering molecules to musculoskeletal tissues; and (6) How the molecular pathophysiology of rare bone and mineral diseases informs treatment and biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
