 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harnessing the exotic features of quantum mechanics to reach beyond the limits of classical physics has emerged as one of the most prominent themes of technological innovations set to define this century. Rather than displace, quantum rules are poised to substantially extend the capacity of existing technologies, with the most promising thrusts being in the realms of computation, sensing and simulation. This project focuses on the last two aspects as their benefits can have a broad impact:  Sensitivity to acceleration and force fields can be dramatically enhanced by quantum effects, with direct applications in metrology and systems control. It has also been long recognized that quantum effects are most effectively simulated by quantum systems.  The fragility of quantum states when interfaced with the human scale continues to drive a quest for better platforms. This project investigates an alternate platform comprising of ultracold atoms confined to a ring-shaped periodic lattice, a system that is robust, yet encompasses all quantum features relevant for applications.  The essence of quantum mechanical advantage lies in the deep hierarchy of correlations within a system that transcends classical notions of locality. Furthermore, applications require a system to evolve in time, necessitating a thorough understanding of its quantum dynamics.  This research will conduct a thorough analysis of these two fundamental aspects of the ring lattice system in the context of utility in multiple pathways for simulators of quantum processes and development of an array of quantum sensors that push the limits of sensitivity.  Training of numerous undergraduate students in physics research will be a priority, building on success under prior grants to leverage the experience to channel students into STEM career paths, including many from under-represented demographics.   \r\n\r\nSensor development will prioritize a mechanism patented under a prior grant to do high precision sensing of rotation and magnetic fields. Instead of interferometry, the staple of precision sensing for over a century, the operating principle is based on a localization transition for coherent media in ring lattices.  Its development and deployment will hinge on how dynamics and quantum correlations impact sensitivity and calibration. Quantum advantage will be sought in enhancing sensitivity with effects like spin-squeezing and multimode coherent dynamics, that can utilize inter-atomic interactions constructively. The ring structure and its generalization to cylinder or torus, with optional lattice structure will be developed as a comprehensive quantum dynamical simulator: Mimicking electronic transitions in atoms with those of the modes of a ring lattice can simulate quantum optics with external degrees of freedom; Quantum entanglement can be generated in collective spin states and applied to effects like quantum teleportation; Matter wave counterparts of optical effects as well as parity-time (PT) symmetric physics that involves atypical non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, can be simulated within the novel context of closed loop lattices; The non-trivial topology supplemented by rotation allows simulation of dynamical topological effects associated with the quantum Hall effect and synthetic gauge fields; The finite unbounded configuration of a ring lattice allows simulation of many-body physics, including phase transitions and quantum dynamics with fewer approximations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
