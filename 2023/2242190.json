 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shifts toward remote warfare have disrupted the prior division between deployment and home life. The decompartmentalization of work and home is like to affect how members of the military engage in the work of remote warfare and to affect family relationships as households are less fully separated from military activities. To understand these dynamics, this doctoral dissertation project uses qualitative methods to investigate how the boundaries between home and work and between military and civilian life are being redrawn for service members and their families. The work advances our understanding of the dynamics of military operations as they spill over increasingly into home life. The project trains a graduate student in scientific cultural anthropology and disseminates results broadly to academic, non-academic, and stakeholder audiences. \r\n\r\nThe labor of warfare has always seeped in some ways into homelife, but remote warfare has made the boundaries between work and home and between military and civilian life blurrier than ever before. To understand how porosity in these boundaries impacts military operations, this doctoral dissertation uses semi-structured interviews and participant observation of service members and their families to investigate the following: 1) how military personnel share military experiences with their families; 2) whether and how conducting warfare from home affects the conduct and experience of military operations; and 3) how military personnel and families understand and experience the shifting boundaries between work and home. The study advances scholarship in the anthropology of labor, kinship theory, and identity theory and more generally sheds light on questions of work-life disruptions that have been pervasive during the Covid-19 era.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

During her funding period, Dr. Butcher spent her research period at a base in the American south conducting interviews with drone personnel on and off base to better understand the experience of the remote warrior and how it challenges conceptions of service in the US military, war, and remote work more broadly. Additionally, she spent one week camping with anti-drone activists in Alamogordo, NM, conducting interviews and participant observation at protest activities to collect data on the way that activists are challenging the military&rsquo;s narrative around drone warfare.&nbsp;Butcher accomplished the goal of her research by expanding the amount of qualitative research done on drone personnel, which adds nuance and the voices of drone personnel themselves to the predominantly quantitative research conducted on them. Additionally, the voices of drone personnel on the job challenges ideas present about personnel currently circulating in the public sphere, largely through whistleblower accounts or media exposes. This research has demonstrated that personnel are negotiating a new form of war with new expectations of the warrior, especially given that because they are not deployed, it is assumed that they are largely removed from harm. However, this research has shown that while personnel are not deployed, they still experience things that until this point have largely been associated with deployment, namely hyperawareness of their surroundings. Additionally, while the military has long participated in shiftwork, shiftwork has remained largely understudied as a component of the contemporary military experience. This research has shown that shiftwork, while seen as essential to the mission, is not considered sustainable by the personnel. It is not sustainable because personnel are expected to participate in their homelives as if they are not on a shiftwork schedule, making it difficult and stressful to maintain healthy sleep and eating patterns, but also maintain relationships. Additionally, because personnel participate in a secret form of war, they are expected to mentally compartmentalize their home and work lives, creating a divide between their family and their work. While some consider this divide essential, others find it creates drastic separations between these two spheres of life.&nbsp;During participant observation with the anti-drone activists, Butcher found that the activists were challenging a form of war that had largely been accepted by the community in which they were protesting. Local community members often pointed out that the base was the community&rsquo;s primary economy, and by coming in and protesting the base, activists were actively challenging what the local community had come to accept as essential to their livelihood. Despite this, Butcher found the activists continued to challenge the what the local community had accepted as &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; This included things like the military&rsquo;s local and global ecological contamination and damage to servicemember&rsquo;s bodies.&nbsp;This dissertation research ultimately culminated into an article, a conference presentation, and a successfully completed dissertation which was defended in May of 2024.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 06/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Georgia&nbsp;Butcher</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
