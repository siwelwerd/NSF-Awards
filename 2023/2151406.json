 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a scalable, on-demand, research-based innovation for learners in virtual and recorded training programs. Research has shown that underrepresented populations arrive at an undergraduate institution less likely to have the advanced study skills or confident awareness to seek assistance when faced with uncertainty in the classroom. This project provides on-demand responses to in-lesson queries and helps develop deep study skills. Additionally, for the students who arrive at college without sufficient familial or academic support, the proposed product becomes a resource to participate successfully in an undergraduate environment. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will build an engine that automatically identifies the discipline of a course based on the extracted words and phrases spoken or visually presented in class, and then will identify terms important to the learning objectives of the course, garnered via categorical arrays of discipline specific keywords. Automatic creation of personalized study guides is initiated based on the learners' individual queries or class discussions. This innovation is applicable to the remote learning industries, where it may increase the value of their customers\u2019 online content and enable teaching professionals to strive for higher levels of equity in the student population.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The centerpiece of our innovation is a search tool, a technological marvel that functions much like a fast-forward button to the pivotal moments of educational videos. This tool has shown to shave minutes off study sessions. Students at the University of Michigan were among the first to experience this transformation, as it was integrated into the campus Learning Management System (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).

For students with special needs, who require precise and tailored information, it has become not just an aid; it is a bridge to self-sufficiency and empowerment.
