 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award supports research that aims to understand why and how sinkholes form above defective buried pipes. Sinkholes induced by defective buried pipes have become a substantial threat to community safety, resulting in fatalities, damage to buildings and infrastructure, and economic loss. However, the collapse mechanism of sinkholes above buried pipes remains unclear, making prediction of sinkhole collapses difficult. In this project, the research team will identify the most susceptible soil and water flow conditions around  defective pipes leading to sinkhole initiation and develop models to predict their growth. Currently, the US has more than one million miles of pipes nearing the end of their service lives that pose a sinkhole risk to their communities. This project will expand our understanding of  formation and collapse mechanisms of such sinkholes to provide predictive capabilities. The research will also be complemented by establishing a responsive and flexible educational and outreach program based on curriculum development and K-12 summer camps that can motivate young students to pursue their college education in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe research goal of this project is to predict sinkholes caused by defective buried pipes based on understanding of progressive formation and collapse mechanisms. To achieve this goal, the objectives are to (i) identify critical hydrogeological parameters leading to initiation of soil internal erosion around defective pipes through soil erosion tests in the laboratory; (ii) model the time-dependent progressive evolution of sinkholes induced by defective buried pipes using a sinkhole simulator; and (iii) develop an analytical method to predict the collapse timing and size of sinkholes considering external loads based on time-dependent soil arching models. This project will test three hypotheses: (1) internal soil erosion around defective buried pipes initiates when the ratio of hole diameter to D85 (i.e., 85% percent fines) of soil infill surrounding the pipe reaches a threshold value related to the hydraulic gradient; (2) sinkholes in a submerged zone will be cone-shaped with an angle from the horizontal direction that equals to the surrounding soil friction angle; and 3) sinkholes above the submerged zone will be dome-shaped, and collapse of the dome will be exaggerated by external loads. This project will allow the PI to advance  knowledge of the sinkhole formation and collapse around defective buried pipes and to lay a firm foundation for his long-term career focused on safety and sustainability of buried civil infrastructures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
