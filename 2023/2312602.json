 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stress impacts our natural world in complex ways. Understanding how those complexities manifest in water, nutrient, and pollutant movement through the natural and human landscape requires bringing together scientists with expertise in a range of topics. This interdisciplinary approach has been referred to as catchment science, which deliberately seeks to include not only hydrologists, but also soil scientists, ecologists, chemists and others. Together catchment scientists can tackle complex environmental problems at a scale that leverages useful system boundaries. This award supports early-career and diverse researchers to attend a Gordon Research Conference in Catchment Science in June 2023. This conference and its associated seminar for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will foster the professional development of the next generation of researchers in catchment science and the development of a core foundation of research to tackle the stressors of today and tomorrow. \r\n\r\nThe confirmed program includes a diverse group of scientists from different career stages and backgrounds, including multi-scale modeling, pharmaceuticals and emerging contaminants, microplastics, drought, fire, and emerging tools to integrate data from these overlapping stressors. Over the coming months, this conference will provide direction to research on environmental stressors and how to disentangle and predict their likely effects. Over the coming years, this conference will support a more diverse and connected international community of catchment scientists and new tools and conceptual models in catchment science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
