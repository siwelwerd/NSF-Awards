 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the renewal of a 10-week research experience program for ten undergraduate students each year at Cornell University. The student interns will be involved in research projects which include current and future planetary missions, exoplanets, time domain radio astronomy, gravitational waves, star formation across cosmic time, and astronomical instrumentation, all under the direct guidance of a cohort of dedicated mentors. The students will also participate in personal and professional development programs that encompass (e.g.) psychosocial support, hands-on computational tutorials, career path options in STEM, research and communication skills, and scientific writing, as well as half-day workshops on various cutting- edge topics in astronomy. The REU student experience will also feature local field trips, including one to a fossil rich stone quarry.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing an immersive scientific research experience, the program also emphasizes inclusivity by actively working to increase the participation of under-represented minorities and women, as well as non-standard students (e.g., single parents with young children, veterans, and 1st generation college students) in astronomy and related STEM fields. Their continued success in these efforts is a highlight of the program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
