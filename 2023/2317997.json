 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate change is disproportionately affecting polar regions, with the Arctic now warming nearly four times faster than the global average. Polar warming drives coastal erosion and increases sediment delivery to the coastal ocean, affecting ecosystem processes ranging from primary productivity to carbon sequestration. Tracking changes in sedimentation rate is urgently needed to determine current conditions and measure further change. In polar regions, however, two of the most globally reliable sediment tracers, the radioisotopes lead-210 (210Pb) and cesium-137 (137Cs), have yielded mixed results. To understand the distribution and usefulness of these radioisotopes at high latitudes, this research makes use of a wealth of polar sediment cores archived at the Oregon State University Marine and Geology Repository combined with data synthesized from the literature. Results provide the first systematic study of Arctic and Antarctic sediment accretion. Improving the tools we use to track changes in sedimentation will help coastal managers and decisionmakers understand how climate change is impacting polar coastlines and marine environments, and what local communities should expect in the future.\r\n\r\nSediment cores will be subsampled and analyzed for the activities of 210Pb (half-life = 22.3 years) and 137Cs (half-life = 30.1 years) using alpha and gamma spectroscopy, respectively. To provide context related to depositional environment, select subsamples will also be analyzed for sediment bulk density, grain size distribution, and organic content. A subset of samples with no measurable 210Pb or 137Cs activity will be analyzed for 14C to determine whether the lack of radioisotopes in a sample is because the core is simply too old, the true surface layer is missing, or because the shorter-lived radioisotopes did not accumulate. By undertaking comprehensive spatial analysis of the distribution of 210Pb and 137Cs in Arctic and Antarctic sediments, this research will achieve three goals: first, measure the activity of short-lived radioisotopes in archived sediment cores, a service to the science community that is urgently needed before the isotopes decay beyond detection; second, produce a comprehensive pole-wide atlas of sediment accretion rates; and finally, conduct a temporal analysis of sedimentation rate changes over the last ~60 to 125 years along the Beaufort Sea coast of northern Alaska, an ecologically and economically important region experiencing environmental transformation due to climate warming.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
