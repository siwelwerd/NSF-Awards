 "awd_abstract_narration": "The underlying flexibility in nervous system structure and function, broadly known as neural plasticity, is the basis for nervous system development and how the nervous system can adapt when organisms are confronted by change. The \"West Virginia Network for Functional Neuroscience and Transcriptomics\" (WV-NFNT) project seeks to build human and physical infrastructure capacity in neuroscience and data science. This project will examine the ability of the nervous system to change during development and in response to stimuli along two themes: 1) circuit plasticity during development and adulthood; and 2) synaptic structure and plasticity as a result of altered function. WV-NFNT will expand the capability and diversity of those working in the fields of neuroscience and data science by implementing specific education and workforce development activities that will engage students, especially rural, first-generation college students, and those from other groups traditionally underrepresented, in these research areas. New collaborations among neuroscientists and bio-informaticists from four institutions across the state will position West Virginia to be a center for neuroscience research. The project will be administered by the Higher Education Policy Commission in collaboration with four institutions: Marshall University, Shepherd University, West Virginia University, and West Virginia State University.\r\n\r\nThe WV-NFNT project will contribute to one of the most impactful neuroscience research areas \u2013 circuit and synaptic plasticity. Despite the importance of neural plasticity, the mechanisms by which the brain changes are not fully understood. WV-NFNT is specifically designed to use advanced techniques including stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and single-cell and/or spatial transcriptomics to understand neural plasticity of circuits, neurons, glia, and synapses in various animal models. New methodologies to elucidate structure-function relationships at high resolution are advancing the ability to examine how synapses, cells, and neural circuits are controlled at a level of spatial detail not possible until recently.  The WV-NFNT project brings together researchers who work on these questions and provides the infrastructure to address key gaps in knowledge about neural function. The project will grow the neuroscience and bioinformatics community in West Virginia, and a significant portion of the research component of this project will be conducted by graduate and undergraduate trainees. Formalized training and mentorship of trainees in neuroscience and data science research, coupled with access to internships, will contribute to the goal of placing West Virginians in competitive post-graduate programs or employment in STEM industries. WV-NFNT will also expand the capability and diversity of those working in the fields of neuroscience and data science by implementing specific education and workforce development activities that will engage trainees across the career continuum\u2014especially rural, first-generation college students, and those from other groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
