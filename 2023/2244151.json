 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to Duquesne University, located in Pittsburgh, PA, supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2023-2025. Funded by the Division of Chemistry, the Duquesne REU site continues to impact the professional chemistry careers and education of undergraduates and faculty from Appalachian regional institutions with limited research infrastructure and/or from underrepresented populations. To meet this challenge, Duquesne University delivers a quality research experience, with a focus on computational and theoretical chemistry, that motivates undergraduates and faculty to achieve their highest academic performance and best prepare them for scientific research and discovery. The core idea is to establish meaningful, year-round, and long-term research collaborations driven by the need for academic productivity and excellence in undergraduate training. The REU site serves national interest by promoting advances in the basic sciences, training and support of the U.S. scientific workforce, and advancing prosperity and welfare.\r\n \r\nThis project focuses on strong financial and infrastructure support of research collaborations that invigorate PUI/HBC/LSAMP faculty, who in turn directly impact students and learning environments at their home institutions. Duquesne has NSF-funded resources, established research programs, proven record in student placement, and strong partnerships with local industry. REU students receive explicit training to reinforce the scientific method, scientific writing and speaking, ethics, safety, and workshops on state-of-the-art instrumentation to complement their experimental research and build invaluable skill sets. Each student has the opportunity to present their research locally, regionally, and nationally to expand their professional exposure and networking to make more informed career decisions and best prepare for graduate school. The PUI/HBC/LSAMP faculty are empowered through meaningful and productive academic collaboration to enhance their professional development. The broader impacts of this work include meaningful research experiences to attract and retain the nation\u2019s diverse student talent pool, which has the consequence of enhancing and diversifying the U.S. workforce by adding experts in the fields of chemistry or biochemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
