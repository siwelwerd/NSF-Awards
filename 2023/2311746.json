 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) will lead the Bridge to Postsecondary Computer Science (CS) project and host convenings of the CS Education community and produce a report outlining recommendations on the content of a high school computer science course to satisfy a graduation requirement, the alignment of such a course with Advanced Placement computer science courses and introductory post-secondary courses, and model pathways for high school computer science beyond an introductory course for all students. The Bridge to Postsecondary CS project seeks to understand and provide recommendations based on how these forces should inform the future of foundational high school computer science, AP Computer Science, the introductory experience at institutions of higher education, and course pathways in high school. Timed to provide recommendations ahead of updates to the CSTA Standards and AP computer science course frameworks, the results of this project have the potential to influence content used by over 40 state departments of education, curriculum and professional development providers across the field, and high school courses taken by tens of thousands of students annually.\r\n\r\nAcross 18 months, the Bridge to Postsecondary Computer Science (CS) project will host convenings of the CS Education community and produce a report outlining recommendations on the content of a high school computer science course to satisfy a graduation requirement, the alignment of such a course with AP computer science courses and introductory post-secondary courses, and model pathways for high school computer science beyond an introductory course for all students. With the long-term goal of creating clear alignment of CS courses that fulfill a high school graduation requirement, AP computer science courses, and introductory post- secondary computer science courses, Bridge to Postsecondary CS partners expect the following project outcomes over the grant period:  (1) three meetings of representatives from across the K- 13 CS education landscape (including teachers, administrators, 2- and 4-year college instructors, curriculum developers, and industry), with written summaries shared with the public; (2) release of a written report with recommendations on the content that should be included in courses satisfying a high school graduation requirement, and how future CSTA standards and AP courses could be adjusted to align with such a course; (3) models of high school computer science courses (high level course descriptions and outcomes) that create potential pathways beyond an introductory course for all students; and (4) a framework that enables a systematic and deliberate process for examining and recreating similar pathways in the future. To broaden participation, the project will seek to align various stakeholders, at a time when momentum is on CS education\u2019s side, to create an aligned and coherent course framework that could increase access, participation, high school and college course credentials, and have it aligned to industry needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
