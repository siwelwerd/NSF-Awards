 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of advancements in geophysics and engineering using environmental and geospatial solutions by utilizing models based on remote sensing and other spatial data. This project may impact areas such as urban sustainability, water quality and quantity monitoring, and risk analyses based on natural and climate change. Nowadays, with significant satellite remote sensing observations availability and advances in machine learning and cloud computing, new analyses could inform various stakeholders and policy makers. Satellite data are advantageous because of their spatial (from local up to global scale) and temporal coverage (some from decades ago) which could significantly lower the costs of alternative, ground-based, data collection and processing. Particular topics such as water quality monitoring (including Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) detection) and identifying a resilient solution for pedestrians during heatwaves using satellite data are among the technology and services to be explored in this project.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of high spatial and temporal resolution satellite data products using data processing, machine learning, and validation efforts. The project defines the existing gaps that could be filled with remote sensing and data processing technologies such as: algorithms to statistically develop a high spatio-temporal resolution downscaled satellite data; models to identify cool corridors and open street paths as a resilient solution and response to urban heat islands (UHIs) which will mitigate the adverse health impacts of UHIs; and algorithms for small water-bodies and lakes water quality monitoring using fine resolution satellite imageries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
