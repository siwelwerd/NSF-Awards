 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in a workshop \u201cGender Equity in the Mathematical Study (GEMS) of Commutative Algebra\u201d that will take place at the University of Minnesota, November 10-12, 2023. It will focus on forming a community of women and non-binary mathematicians interested in commutative algebra but will be open to people of all genders. The workshop is primarily aimed at graduate students in their first through third years of a Ph.D. program. It will include presentations from a diverse group of prominent researchers, active group work, opportunities for participants to present their own research, and community building activities. The goals of the workshop are to (a) introduce participants to cutting edge research topics in commutative algebra and surrounding fields, (b) facilitate the formation of mentoring relationships, (c) strengthen the network of women and non-binary mathematicians in commutative algebra and surrounding fields, and (d) develop collaborative relationships that cut across subdisciplines and involve diverse groups of researchers. This meeting will give young women and non-binary commutative algebraists access to the mentoring it is well understood is essential for retention in STEM fields. It will also provide them with role models to help them see themselves as professional mathematicians and build their sense of belonging to the mathematical community.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will introduce graduate student participants to contemporary and exciting research in commutative algebra. The workshop will have three 50-minute plenary lectures given by faculty, three 20-minute talks given by senior graduate students, and a poster session for all participants to share their own research. The talks will highlight not only pure commutative algebra but will also highlight interactions between commutative algebra and adjacent fields, such as algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and even neural network modeling.  In order to help participants better understand the techniques and methods presented in the plenary talks, there will be problem sessions for active work. These activities will promote the growth of mathematically collaborative relationships among participants and will build their mathematical skills. More information about this conference can be found at https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/gems-of-ca-2023/home\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
