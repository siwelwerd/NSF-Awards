 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate strategies to quantify, evaluate, and improve physical accessibility of everyday clothing using minimalistic, garment-based assistive soft robotics.  To this end, a collaborative effort brings together experts in apparel design, soft robotics, human-computer interaction/human factors, and rehabilitation to explore open questions both in design for accessibility and in garment-based robotics.  The project will lay the groundwork for a large-scale study to pursue a future of universally accessible clothing that seamlessly blends everyday garments and soft robotics, and which accommodates users with a variety of abilities, limitations, needs, and objectives.  Project outcomes will ultimately lead to new approaches to both evaluate and robotically customize/support body-garment interfaces for a wide range of wearable systems, from everyday clothing to robotic exoskeletons to orthoses/prostheses. \r\n\r\nProject goals will be pursued through two specific thrusts: (1) Formulate a set of generalizable user-identified evaluation criteria / metrics for assessing accessibility of garments; (2) Design and implement a self-tightening / fastening \"robotic belt\" as a proof-of-concept prototype of a soft robotic \"garment\" to establish preliminary evidence of the feasibility and transformative potential of the approach.  The novel garment accessibility evaluation metrics and soft-robotic technology proof-of-concept combined will set the stage for the development and deployment o several garment-based soft-robotic accessibility solutions and evaluation of their impact at improving accessibility of everyday clothing compared to existing passive accessibility solutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
