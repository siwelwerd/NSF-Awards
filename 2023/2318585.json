 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides complimentary registration for 100 students and postdoctoral fellows studying in the US to attend the 17th US National Congress on Computational Mechanics (USNCCM17) which will be held 23-27 July 2023 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The objective is to broaden the participation from graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, participants from underrepresented communities and women, and undergraduate students that aspire to learn more about the broad discipline of computational mechanics. Consideration in the selection process will be given to the inclusion of members of underrepresented groups, diversity of institutions that the participants represent, and diversity of programs within engineering. The aim is to grow the pipeline of U.S. researchers interested in computational mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe US National Congress on Computational Mechanics (USNCCM) has been the biennial congress of the US Association for Computational Mechanics (USACM) beginning in 1991. USNCCM17, organized in collaboration with staff from Sandia National Laboratories, will provide a forum for bringing together students, researchers, and practitioners from academia, industry, government, and laboratories from all over the world to discuss the latest advancements and future directions in various fields pertaining to computational engineering and sciences. With over 85 topical minisymposia, the conference includes research areas across the broad spectrum of computational mechanics and engineering science, as well as additional themes that represent special topics of current importance including data-driven modeling and machine learning, advanced manufacturing, climate modeling, and exascale computing. Congress highlights include plenary and semi-plenary lectures, minisymposia with keynote lectures and regular presentations, and product displays by various industries and software companies. The Congress will include a networking event for female researchers, a student poster competition, a career panel, a funding agency information session, and several short courses addressing advances in current topics of interest in computational engineering and science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
