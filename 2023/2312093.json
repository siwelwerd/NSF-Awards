 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) project aims at designing theories and algorithms for scalable multi-agent planning and control to support safety-critical autonomous eVTOL aircraft in high-throughput, uncertain and dynamic environments. Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging air transportation mode in which electrical vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft will safely and efficiently transport passengers and cargo within urban areas. Guidance from the White House, the National Academy of Engineering, and the US Congress has encouraged fundamental research in UAM to maintain the US global leadership in this field. The success of UAM will depend on the safe and robust multi-agent autonomy to scale up the operations to high-throughput urban air traffic. Learning-based techniques such as deep reinforcement learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning are developed to support planning and control for these eVTOL vehicles. However, there is a major challenge to provide theoretical safety and robustness guarantees for these learning-based neural network in-the-loop models in multi-agent autonomous UAM applications. In this project, the researchers will collaborate with committed government and industry partners on the use-case-inspired fundamental research, with a focus on promoting safety and reliability of AI, machine learning and autonomy in students with diverse backgrounds.\r\n \r\nThe technical objectives of this project include (1) Safety and Robustness of Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning: in order to address the \u201csafety critical\u201d UAM challenge, the PIs plan the min-max optimization for single agent reinforcement learning to formally build sufficient safety margin, constrained reinforcement learning to formulate safety as physical constraints in state and action spaces, and the novel cautious reinforcement learning that uses variational policy gradient to plan the safest aircraft trajectory with minimum distributional risk; (2) Safety and Robustness of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: in order to address the \u201cheterogeneous agents and scalability\u201d challenge, a novel federated reinforcement learning framework where a central agent coordinates with decentralized safe agents to improve traffic throughput while guaranteeing safety, and a scaling mechanism to accommodate a varying number of decentralized aircraft; (3) Safety and Robustness from Simulations to the Real World: in order to address the \u201chigh-dimensionality and environment uncertainty\u201d challenge, the researchers will focus on the agents\u2019 policy robustness under distribution shift and fast adaptation from simulation to the real world. Specifically, value-targeted model learning to incorporate domain knowledge such as the aircraft and environment physics, and a safe adaptation mechanism after the RL model is deployed online for flight testing or execution is planned.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
