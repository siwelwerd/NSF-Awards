 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal ecosystems provide numerous economic benefits through shipping and trade, fishing, and tourism, but are facing significant challenges from climatic and man-made disturbances. A diverse, skilled, and integrated workforce is needed to assess and meet imminent challenges associated with managing coastal ecosystems across sectors to balance commercial, conservation, and tourism interests. To create such a workforce, this project will develop a training program Biological Opportunities And Training in Science (BOATS) to prepare the next generation of leaders to tackle contemporary and future problems. Many recent university graduates lack access to meaningful research experiences and tangible applied skills in modern baccalaureate degree programs. Gaining such experience is hampered when students, particularly those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, must work during their undergraduate years instead of pursuing internships or work study opportunities. Thus, students may complete their degrees only to find limited job availability due to lack of experience, which can lead students to leave the sciences completely. Targeting students with limited training opportunities during their undergraduate degrees, the Alabama\u2019s Marine Environmental Sciences Consortium (MESC) will develop a postbaccalaureate internship program in collaboration with local government and nonprofit organizations to provide hands-on training, tangible career focused skills, and networking opportunities. This training coupled with professional development will facilitate the pursuit of graduate education and/or future careers in ocean science for BOATS participants and help develop future leaders to address complex problems in coastal ecosystems.\r\n\r\nCoastal marine ecosystems are experiencing radical changes due to widespread climactic and anthropogenic disturbances. These stressors affect habitats, organisms, and food web dynamics, ultimately changing ecosystem services and resources relied upon by coastal communities. Situated between the Mobile-Tensaw Delta (i.e., America\u2019s Amazon) and the Fisheries Fertile Crescent in the Northern Gulf of Mexico, Alabama\u2019s MESC is well poised to address how multiple stressors influence organisms\u2019 distribution and interactions. Environmental change is driving species northward (i.e., topicalization), while simultaneously causing unprecedented changes in hypoxia, salinity, temperature, and alkalinity. Coupled with pollution and overfishing, environmental change poises significant challenges for coastal ecosystems. Understanding the synergistic interactions among these factors is paramount for both basic and applied scientists. The BOATS training program involves cutting edge research on interactions among multiple stressors while providing training and experience with academic and nonacademic scientists to address complex issues in coastal environments. Ongoing collaborative research and facilities are in place for the BOATS program to be impactful for basic and applied science while preparing the next generation of leaders and their mentors to solve complex problems in coastal ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
