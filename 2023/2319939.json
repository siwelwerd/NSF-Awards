 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation Program, the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). It supports the acquisition of instrumentation for ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-qToF) by Mississippi State University, strengthening the research instrumentation infrastructure in Mississippi. High-resolution mass spectrometry is a critical instrumental technique for the characterization of new synthetic chemical species and is a sensitive method for detecting and characterizing low-concentration species, for example in biological and environmental samples. Twelve research groups in the Department of Chemistry are identified as users and the instrument will also be available to other researchers from across campus and beyond. In addition to supporting research activities, the instrument will also be used for educational activities, including training of student researchers and incorporation into laboratory courses. \r\n\r\nThe new instrument will ensure that researchers at Mississippi State University continue to have access to state-of-the-art high-resolution mass spectrometry required for the characterization of novel syntheses and reaction monitoring. Several projects will make use of this aspect of the instrument, with examples including characterization of heterobimetallic complexes for hydrodenitrogenation processes relevant to production of cleaner fuels, characterization of catalysts and reaction products aimed at performing organic transformations in sustainable solvents like water or ethanol, and characterization of catalysts and reactions aimed at improving stereo- and site-selective functionalizations and transformations relevant to pharmaceutical manufacture among other applications. The new instrument has excellent sensitivity and is coupled to an ultra-high performance chromatography instrument, allowing for analyte species to be measured in low-concentration and/or complex matrix samples. Examples of research that will benefit from these aspects of the instrument include characterization of the adsorption and decomposition of polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with modified biochar and the characterization of ionic liquid degradation products that may be relevant as emerging environmental contaminants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
