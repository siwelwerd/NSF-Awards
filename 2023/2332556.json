 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the first half of the 20th century, there was a serious debate between the Cambridge and Gottingen schools about the role of viscosity/friction in generating lift over a wing; the former school asserts that viscosity is necessary, and the latter does not see any contradiction in generating lift by an ideal (non-viscous) fluid. This debate is deeply rooted in the 300-year-old paradox in fluid physics: d\u2019Alembert paradox, which asserts that ideal fluids are forceless; they cannot lift an airplane. This century-old debate is rejuvenated due to a recent result which asserts that the flow field evolves to minimize total curvature; and a minimum-curvature flow over a wing is lifting even if the fluid is non-viscous. This principle of least curvature, which dates back to Hertz in the 19th century, is quite generic; it is applicable to fluids as well as other mechanical systems. For example, according to general relativity, a planet orbits the sun in the least curvature way over the space-time world. The goal of this Research Advanced by Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering (RAISE) cross-disciplinary grant between engineering and physics is to test the following hypothesis: Can an ideal flow generate lift? Since a superfluid (e.g., Helium II below 2K) behaves like an ideal fluid below a critical velocity, the following testable hypothesis will be investigated instead: Can airplanes \ufb02y in super\ufb02uid? \r\n \r\nThe above hypothesis will be tested by creating a superfluid wind tunnel allowing a superfluid to flow over small wings of different shapes and measuring the resulting lift force and its time evolution.  This research will lead to a new theory of lift from first principles in physics in contrast to the classical theory. Moreover, this research will correct the accepted wisdom that prevailed over a century about the viscous nature of lift generation. Hence, this study will resolve the 300-year-old d\u2019Alembert paradox by showing that d\u2019Alembert\u2019s zero-force solution was only one of many possible solutions of Euler\u2019s equation. And in numerous cases, Nature selects a lifting solution. This research will show the physics of the unsteady lifting mechanism, which is currently solely attributed to viscous effects. Ultimately, this research will lead to a new understanding of the role of viscosity in fluid mechanics.\r\n\r\nThis project was funded by the NSF ENG/CBET Fluid Dynamics, ENG/CMMI Dynamics, Control and Systems Diagnostics, and MPS/DMR Condensed Matter Physics programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
