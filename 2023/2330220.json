 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides support for students based at U.S. institutions to attend the 29th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (ACM MobiCom 2023), held from October 2, 2023 to October 6, 2023 in Madrid, Spain. In addition to the regular conference program, MobiCom 2023 includes a set of workshops, panels, research demonstrations, and a poster session.  MobiCom attracts world-leading researchers and practitioners to attend and present their work and participate in panels and keynote sessions. For these reasons, attending MobiCom provides students with an invaluable learning opportunity and learn from the very best researchers in mobile computing and networking technologies.\r\n\r\nMobiCom is dedicated to addressing the challenges of mobile computing and networking and has emerged as one of the leading conferences covering networks, systems, algorithms, and applications that support the convergence of mobile computers and wireless networks. The travel grant program has a proven record of providing students the means to benefit from this educational experience. Participation in MobiCom is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, provides students with an opportunity to interact with more senior researchers, and exposes them to leading-edge research in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
