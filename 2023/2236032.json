 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing undergraduate chemistry students\u2019 competency to engage in the practices of scientists, as well as facilitating students\u2019 beliefs in their abilities to engage in these science practices, which is known as science practice self-efficacy (SPSE). Facility with scientific practices and confidence in carrying them out are critical for students\u2019 ability to apply their scientific understandings both in school and in post-school life. The project team plans to implement a novel approach to engaging chemistry learners in science practices. They also plan to develop new survey instruments to generate evidence that can be used to better understand the relationships among students\u2019 science practice competency, self-efficacy, science identity, and chemistry course performance. The findings have the potential to improve introductory chemistry education and support the development of scientifically literate STEM graduates.\r\n \r\nThis project is a collaboration between researchers at University of Nebraska-Lincoln and California State University-Fullerton. Project activities will include (1) developing and testing high-quality instruments for measuring science practice self-efficacy and science practice competency, (2) conducting a quasi-experimental study in general chemistry and organic chemistry courses to identify how engaging chemistry students in science practices supports their science practice competency and SPSE, and (3) modeling the relationship between SPSE and relevant outcome variables using a structural equation model. The project will leverage the complementary expertise of the research team and tailored expertise of the advisory board members to ensure the quality of all products generated through research activity. The measures of science practice self-efficacy and science practice competency to be developed will have the potential be useful for researchers across STEM education fields. These products will be disseminated through publications and resource databases accessible to the wider chemistry education community such as the Chemistry Instrument Review and Assessment Library (CHIRAL) and Organic Chemistry Educational Resources (OrganicERs). The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
