 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a workshop entitled \u201cDynamical Systems in the Life Sciences\u201d (https://sites.google.com/d.umn.edu/dsls2023/home), to be held in Columbus, Ohio from July 13-15, 2023, in the week preceding the planned 2023 Society of Mathematical Biology (SMB) annual meeting at the same location. The workshop will bring together a diverse mix of researchers representing a broad spectrum of backgrounds and diverse expertise and experience within the modern mathematical biology community. This will provide an excellent opportunity for fostering collaborative interactions among researchers with common interests in dynamical systems and in life sciences. The discussions during talks, poster sessions and social events will give ample opportunity to share different perspectives and suggest new scientific projects. Besides invited talks, there will be two nearly two-hour poster sessions during day 1 and day 2 of the workshop, along with contributed talk sessions. These opportunities are designated to provide junior researchers, especially those from under-represented groups, with a platform to to present their research and actively engage in the problems of theory of applied dynamical systems and its applications in modern life sciences.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will emphasize new advancements in mathematics, especially the dynamical systems theory, that were inspired by biological applications. Accordingly, a majority of talks during the workshop will be 30-35 minutes and technically detailed, creating better opportunities for interdisciplinary interactions. The workshop format also promises to attract a broad representation of the mathematical biology community, including researchers from underrepresented groups, early career researchers, and researchers from R2 universities. The specific topics covered by the workshop presentations will include: biomechanical models, cancer modeling, free boundary problems in cardiovascular  and autoimmune disease, pattern formation, models of homeostasis  and diseases spread. The workshop will also help foster mentoring across career stages and expose early-career researchers (particularly those from the underrepresented groups) to new research and collaboration opportunities in one of the most important areas of modern interdisciplinary STEM research. The workshop presentations and materials will be disseminated broadly across the mathematical biology community through the conference website and a special issue in the pre-eminent mathematical biology journal, Mathematical Biosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
