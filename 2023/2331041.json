 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of radar absorbing materials (RAM) for high-temperature harsh environments.  Currently, radar absorbing materials are too heavy and possess limited temperature survivability in harsh environment applications. The proposed technology utilizes ceramic composites rather than traditional polymer, carbon, or iron materials for its radar absorbing properties, which represents is a new approach to stealth coatings that may have wide application for the defense industry.  The technology is aimed at aerospace and defense applications, such as aircraft engine nozzles and their aerodynamically heated parts and may be used in the stealth coating industry.  The development of high-performance, microwave-absorbing materials may have an impact on the stealth warfare market, especially that of fighter jets and missiles. The proposed material system lowers the observability of stealth aircraft, enhances the air defense capability, and may increase national security.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of high-temperature, microwave-absorbing ceramic nanocomposite materials.  The proposed materials have a wide microwave absorption bandwidth covering the entire Ka-band (26.5-40 GHz), and can sustain at high temperatures (>1000 C). Compared with current radar absorbing materials, which are heavy and possess limited temperature survivability (<400 C), the proposed nanocomposite design provides high-performance microwave absorption in high and low temperatures and harsh environment applications.  There is interest in ultra-high temperature ceramics because of their high melting points, retained mechanical properties under high temperature, excellent corrosion resistance, and the refractory oxide on the surface to provide good oxidation resistance. In addition, their high electrical conductivity is another distinguishing property that may further be explored and manipulated.  Radar absorbing materials developed for high-temperature harsh environments may be highly desirable for aerospace and defense applications, such as aircraft engine nozzles and their aerodynamically heated parts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
