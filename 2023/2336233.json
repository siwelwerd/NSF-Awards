 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 1st Conference of Magnetic Technologies and Clinical Applications in Neuroscience (MagCAN Conference) will be held on August 24 - August 25, 2023, at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. The conference will cover research areas on the latest developments in magnetic devices and systems, with a particular emphasis on their potential applications in brain stimulation and sensing, diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, and brain-inspired technologies. Poster sessions will also be held following the oral sessions and will feature posters from the invited speakers and accepted contributing posters. The organization committee consists of notable people in the field of magnetism and neural engineering. This is a travel request is to support US students to participate in the conference. Students will be able to present posters and improve their presentation skills. There will also be opportunities to interact with the leading experts in the field of neurostimulation and magnetics through various sessions.  The organizers of the conference are particularly encouraging women and underrepresented minorities to participate. MagCAN 2023 will play an important role in the education of young scientists and researchers in a fast-moving and high impact fields of brain disorders. The students will learn both fundamental as well as highly advanced concepts in neurostimulation and magnetics related technologies through talks delivered by the leading experts and poster presentations. This proposal will help US graduate and undergraduate students to present and participate in the conference and broaden their perspective in an interdisciplinary field.\r\n\r\nThe technical topics for Magnetic Technologies and Clinical Applications in Neuroscience (MagCAN Conference) include: Neurostimulation based on Magnetic and Related Technologies addressing Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), Micromagnetic and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (MMS & amp TMS), Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS), Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS), Neuromodulation for chronic pain management, Neuromodulation for movement disorders, Closed-Loop Neuromodulation; Neuron Sensing based on Spintronics and Related Technologies addressing Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), Implantable Neuroelectronic Devices, Electroencephalography (EEG), Magnetoencephalography (MEG), Neural Decoding, Neural Signal Processing, Neuron Networks; and  Brain Inspired Technologies based on Magnetic and Spintronic Materials addressing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Neuromorphic Computing, Cognitive Computing, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), Biomimetic Sensors.  The goal is to leverage the knowledge gained from these advances in magnetic and spintronic research and their related principles to develop innovative and novel concepts in neuro-electronics and neuro-technologies that mimic the workings of the brain. Invited talks, contributed talks and posters will be presented in the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
