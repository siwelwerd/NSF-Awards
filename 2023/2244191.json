 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to the National Science Foundation's mission to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; or to secure the national defense, this REU Site on Computational Sciences and Engineering exposes a diverse body of students to different problems in computational sciences and engineering and solving them through the application of methods from cybersecurity, data analytics, machine learning, process automation, structural engineering, and data driven safety management. Students get direct, hands-on experience in research projects that help address important societal problems. Such hands-on experiences significantly enhance students\u2019 scientific problem-solving skills and appreciation of the role of the scientific method for investigating and solving technical problems. Applying theory to solving real-world problems helps solidify students\u2019 interest in STEM and is the key to increasing retention and graduation rates for minority serving institutions and providing upward mobility opportunities to students from underrepresented communities. With the program\u2019s research activities, year-long faculty mentoring and coaching, and continuing engagement through research presentations and publications, the interest of participating students in STEM education are significantly increased. The research and educational opportunities offered are the stepping-stones in educating undergraduate students as scientists and researchers.\r\n\r\nThis REU aims to increase and solidify the interest and proficiency in STEM among rising sophomore, junior, and senior undergraduate students as well as students from community colleges by providing: a stimulating research environment; active research engagement; pursuit of new knowledge and solutions to important societal challenges; and follow-up support of cohorts with eight undergraduates per year for three years.  Specifically, this REU helps to achieve the following objectives by significantly improving participating students\u2019: 1) desire to pursue STEM careers; 2) confidence to do well in STEM; 3) desire to pursue computational sciences and engineering related careers; 4) desire to pursue graduate studies; 5) desire to challenge themselves for continuous self-improvement; 6) academic performance in STEM courses; 7) soft  skills; and 8) ability and motivation to graduate with STEM degrees for future research careers. The preceding objectives are achieved through the implementation of the following three strategic components: i) 8-week summer research experiences for participating undergraduate students; ii) Year-long follow-up coaching and mentoring for participating students; and iii) Dissemination of research results through presentations and/or publications (locally and nationally).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
