 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Old Dominion University (ODU) Re-envisioning Inclusive and Sustainable Excellence (RISE) project is designed to make a significant contribution to ODU's efforts to eliminate systemic gender and racial inequities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Gender and racial biases produce gaps in recruitment, hiring, tenure, and promotion, and contribute to adverse departmental climates. Using an intersectional lens, the RISE project team will adapt evidence-based strategies from previous ADVANCE programs to ODU\u2019s specific STEM environment. The RISE project seeks to achieve sustainable change that will transform ODU\u2019s campus community into one that embraces a vibrant and diverse STEM faculty.\r\n\r\nThe ODU RISE project has three goals: 1) Improve STEM faculty recruitment and hiring processes; 2) Address equity issues related to the tenure and promotion process, and 3) Improve departmental climate to enhance inclusivity. Using an intersectional lens, the RISE project\u2019s structured interventions include: 1) providing resources for STEM departments for hiring and holding departments and deans accountable for their hiring practices; 2) creating processes for equitable launch upon hire, equitable distribution of service, and increased transparency in the evaluation of scholarly work and promotion and tenure guidelines; and 3) implementing strategies and programs that foster academic culture change and result in departments where diverse STEM faculty can thrive. The goals and activities are mutually supportive, reciprocal, and necessary for progress and sustainability. The RISE project aims to raise awareness about equity issues among faculty members and improve the departmental climate of all STEM disciplines. The outcomes of the RISE project will be disseminated locally, regionally, and nationally by ODU media professionals and the Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). The RISE project will promote mindfulness about the implementation of intersectional strategies that enhance inclusivity in STEM at other similarly situated institutions across the nation. \r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.\u202f Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.\u202f ADVANCE \"Adaptation\" awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based strategies to academic, non-profit institutions of higher education as well as non-academic, non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
