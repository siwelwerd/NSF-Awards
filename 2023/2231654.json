 "awd_abstract_narration": "This IUCRC planning project will investigate the feasibility of a multi-site center for Aviation Big Data Analytics (ABDA) that aims to address two fundamental issues: limited access to aviation big data; and a shortage of robust workforce with integrated big data analytics and aviation competencies. The proposed ABDA Center will advance research and education through discovery and innovation at the confluence of big data analytics and aviation. Its mission is to develop big data analytics solutions specially designed for the aviation industry to ensure the safety, security, and prosperity of the U.S Aviation Ecosystem.\r\n \r\nABDA has two sites: Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU), and New Mexico State University (NMSU). ABDA\u2019s research will focus on four thrust areas: (1) Data characterization and data requirement identification; (2) Development of next-generation big data-enabled systems, services, and applications; (3) Development of diverse ABDA-capable U.S. Workforce of the Future; and (4) Development of AI/machine learning solutions towards sustainable aviation. NMSU brings expertise in energy-aware autonomy of emerging electrified aircraft for advanced air mobility, energy cost and emission assessment, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. Complementary expertise at the other site includes aviation data science and business analytics, flight research, unmanned aerial systems and autonomous systems, and aviation cybersecurity.\r\n \r\nABDA Center's research is expected to have three major societal implications: (1) to foster novel big data analytics/AI/machine learning approaches that ensure the safety, security, and prosperity of the U.S. Aviation Ecosystem; (2) to foster a research community committed to advancing research and education at the confluence of big data analytics and aviation, and to transitioning its findings into industry practice; and (3) to collaborate with a minority serving institution site to recruit more underrepresented students and develop diverse ABDA-capable U.S. Workforce of the Future. NMSU will advance diversity by recruiting and educating students. \r\n \r\nAll data, software, and artifacts produced in this project will be archived and preserved, according to standard institutional security and privacy practices and policies, for at least five years.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
