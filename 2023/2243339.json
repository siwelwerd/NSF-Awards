 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need of recruiting, developing, and retaining a diverse and talented group of high school science and mathematics teachers with the knowledge, practices, and dispositions to enact culturally relevant STEM education. The project will identify and attract high-achieving STEM majors through systematic outreach efforts and a \"Try Teaching Stipend\" opportunity. Recruitment will target a diverse and qualified pool of applicants that includes people of color, first generation college students, veterans, and multilingual speakers. Scholars will complete Loyola University Chicago\u2019s initial teacher education program, aligned with Illinois\u2019 Culturally Responsive Teaching and Leading Standards, and designed to support development of teachers\u2019 deep understanding of subject matter and how it can be transformative to students\u2019 lives. Coursework also embeds preparation for educating multilingual learners and ensures eligibility for the state's English as a Second Language (ESL) endorsement. Induction support will include participation in field experiences and coaching \"shadow days\" in partner schools, as well as ongoing mentoring and collaborative professional learning, all designed to support instructional effectiveness and retention. \r\n\r\nIn this project, Loyola\u2019s School of Education, College of Arts and Sciences, School of Sustainability, and Center for Science and Math Education will partner with Illinois District 219 and Chicago Public Schools. Five project goals guide the execution of the project. First is to provide financial and other supports to at least 19 high-achieving prospective biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics teachers who commit to teaching in high-need schools. Second is to increase the number and diversity of STEM majors and professionals entering teaching. The third goal is to prepare candidates to work with culturally and linguistically diverse students, ensuring that 100% of Scholars fulfill requirements for the state English as a Second Language (ESL) endorsement. Fourth is to retain teachers in Chicago high-need schools through rigorous preparation combined with high-quality, multi-dimensional induction support. Finally, the fifth goal is to study program data to inform understanding of urban STEM teacher preparation, mentoring, and induction support. Specifically, program research will study potential connections among culturally sustaining instructional practices, induction supports, and teacher retention. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
