 "awd_abstract_narration": "The height and shape of mountain ranges exert a profound influence on the world around us. Mountains host a variety of ecological habitats, provide much of the water and nutrients necessary for life, the critical minerals needed for society, and influence climate and weather patterns. The size and shape of mountains reflect the underlying solid Earth processes responsible for how the crust deforms, for earthquakes, and for related natural hazards. Despite their importance, it remains exceptionally difficult to recover the history of mountains including how changes in their height and shape interact with the atmosphere to drive climate and weather. This project seeks to apply new advances in the atmospheric and geosciences to a natural experiment in central Asia where the height and shape of the Altai Mountains over the past 50 million years are thought to have precipitated a major change in atmospheric circulation and in climate. The Altai are one of the major ranges in Asia that substantially modify regional climate and ecosystems and spawn some of the largest intracontinental earthquakes ever recorded. This research will use a novel weather model to predict changes in atmospheric circulation and climate in response to the size, height, and growth history of the Altai. These model predictions will be measured against field and laboratory data gleaned from the sediments shed from the Altai. Using rock magnetic data preserved in the sediments, and the steepness of river channels carved into the mountains, the principal investigators will be able to construct an age model consistent with the onset and growth history of the Altai range. This interdisciplinary approach will be pursued by a multi-university, diverse team in the U.S. that includes early-career professors, graduate students and undergraduates in collaboration with Mongolian colleagues at the Institute for Astronomy and Geophysics. The project will train three PhD students, three early-career scientists, and one undergraduate in inter-disciplinary geosciences and build international exchange opportunities. The results of this research will improve understanding of the coupling among solid Earth and atmospheric processes and contribute to addressing societal challenges, such as building resistance to climate change and to earthquake-related natural hazards.   \r\n\r\nMountain topography reflects complex couplings among tectonic, dynamic, and surficial processes and influences climatic evolution, marine and terrestrial biogeochemistry, and even the development of biodiversity. Unfortunately, the climatic proxies which are so often used to reconstruct past topography are themselves dependent upon a variety of other factors. Consequently, constraining the tectonic and/or dynamic processes that are responsible for the height of mountains remains exceptionally difficult. This project will leverage novel advances in the atmospheric sciences to understand topographic growth beyond the simple upslope model of orographic rainout. The project focuses on the Altai Mountains of northern Central Asia, a poorly understood Cenozoic rejuvenation of the Central Asia Orogenic Belt that rises more than 4 kilometers, casts a substantial rain shadow, and is associated with some of the largest intracontinental earthquakes on record. Altai uplift has been variously attributed to far-field stress propagation from the collision of India and Eurasia or to dynamic support from a mantle plume, a subducting slab, or lithospheric delamination. Each of these uplift mechanisms predict a unique spatial and temporal pattern of rock uplift and of regional climate change, based upon how and when these uplift mechanisms modified the height, shape, and orientation of the Altai. Existing data are contradictory; sedimentary, geomorphic, and thermochronologic data indicate that tectonic uplift began in the Paleogene, whereas paleoclimate data from both windward and leeward basins suggest no clear climatic change until the late Miocene, when there appears to be substantial aridification in western Mongolia. The project focuses on collecting new spatially-resolved rock uplift data using inversions of fluvial topography and new stable and clumped isotope records of paleoclimate from leeside basins. The age model for both rock uplift and of climatic change across western Mongolia will be constrained by magneto- and cyclostratigraphic-based age models of adjacent, syn-deformational basin sediments. The Weather Research and Forecasting model will be used to predict the climate impact of distinct Altai topographic histories. Combined, these data sets permit tests of the theories that seek to explain Cenozoic Altai uplift.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
