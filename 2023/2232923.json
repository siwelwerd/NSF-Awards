 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an integrated, single needle filter which removes glass shards from injectable fluids.  Liquid pharmaceuticals and medications are often stored in glass ampoules. To gain access to these medications, each ampoule is manually broken at the neck by a health care provider. This can result in glass shards entering the medication that can cause patient hematomas and/or internal bleeding. United States regulations currently mandate all ampoules must be filtered by health care providers prior to injection which requires a multi-step filter process using multiple needles and needle exchanges. This project aims to develop a single, effective, inline filter which that requires half the time of this current process, while improving safety for the patient and the healthcare worker by reducing the risks of needle stick injuries. The commercial potential is to become the standard of care for the $3 billion global filter market and consumes over six billion disposable glass ampoules every year.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel, disposable, inline, mechanical filter with optimal porosity and density to remove glass ampoule shards. The current practice of breaking ampules at their neck to access medication results in shards that are currently manually filtered using a filter needle prior to administration into the patient. The filter needle must be removed and discarded, and a second sterile needle placed on the syringe for injection. The company aims to develop a novel, all-in-one, integrated filter and needle system utilizing a single inner blunt needle with a novel filter located at the distal end versus the current proximal end where the Luer loc is located.  This solution will enable a single step process for glass filtering and medication injection. The scope of activities includes engineering and validation tests of leakage, pull force, dead volume, labeling and packaging, handling safety, repeatability/consistency, and accelerated aging of the company\u2019s proprietary design concepts. This project aims to provide an assembly suitable for human use that is manufacturable at scale in a cost-effective manner.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Technical goals for the Phase I NSF award consisted of the following: the filter needle shield shall be able to be removed from the hypodermic needle without the use of excess force; the seal tube will properly fit for the hypodermic needle; the pull force during filtering must be within industry standard; and FROG must remove all glass shards from patient medication. It is necessary that medications should flow easily through the FROG filter tube in an amount of time that does not disrupt workflow. Via conducted internal user trials consisting of 21 end users, it was observed and concluded that FROG users did not need nor use excessive force to remove FROG when preparing for injection and the filtering process could be performed correctly, efficiently, and without error with use of FROG. The inner seal is an integral part of FROG as it must align and fit snug with the inner, non-concentric needle and ensure air tightness and, therefore, no leakage. Performed seal testing concluded that a perfect seal equates to a specific draw volume of fluid. The average draw volume with a non-concentric needle equated to 19.38ml. FROG fits within the dimensional tolerancing and maintains the concentricity requirement. Further testing conducted by device engineering company, Root-3, concentrated on validating the optimal pull force when drawing medications. It was discovered that there is a direct correlation between filter length and pull force showing that the larger the filter, the greater pull force required during medication draw, with sterilized filters requiring a 53% higher pull force than unsterilized filters. Further research in the length and filtering is needed to evaluate and select the ideal filter length for FROG. External filtration studies conducted by contracted company, Nelson Labs, showed that FROG filters approximately 50% better than BD Nokor filter and 80% better than the B-Braun Filter Straw. The findings concluded that prior to sterilization and after sterilization with a T0 and T6 accelerated aging, FROG dramatically outperformed both the BD Nokor filter needle and the B-Braun Filter Straw.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 06/05/2024<br>\nModified by: Sue&nbsp;E&nbsp;Carr</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2232923/2232923_10889226_1715807678292_FROG_5mL_BOM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2232923/2232923_10889226_1715807678292_FROG_5mL_BOM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"FROG\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2232923/2232923_10889226_1715807678292_FROG_5mL_BOM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"FROG\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">FROG- Filter Removal of Glass</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sue E Carr</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sue&nbsp;E&nbsp;Carr\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">FROG</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2232923/2232923_10889226_1717613204392_FROG_Device_CarrTech--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2232923/2232923_10889226_1717613204392_FROG_Device_CarrTech--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"FROG Image\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2232923/2232923_10889226_1717613204392_FROG_Device_CarrTech--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"FROG Image\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">FROG Device Completed</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sue E Carr</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sue&nbsp;E&nbsp;Carr\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">FROG Image</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2232923/2232923_10889226_1717614062038_Blunt_FROG_Assembly__MA_203001_001--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2232923/2232923_10889226_1717614062038_Blunt_FROG_Assembly__MA_203001_001--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Blunt FROG Assembly\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2232923/2232923_10889226_1717614062038_Blunt_FROG_Assembly__MA_203001_001--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Blunt FROG Assembly\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Blunt FROG Assembly</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Root-3 Labs</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sue&nbsp;E&nbsp;Carr\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Blunt FROG Assembly</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
