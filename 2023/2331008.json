 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, allowing the institution's faculty and administrators to design and develop a comprehensive plan for improving and expanding STEM instruction.\u202f \r\n \r\nTurtle Mountain Community College (TMCC) serves the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians. In response to a state mandate for teacher credentialing in cybersecurity and computer science in K-12 grades, TMCC is undertaking a self-study, planning, and development project addressing these crucial fields.  The community served by TMCC is underrepresented in cybersecurity and computer science, so developing a program of study to offer to the K-12 professional community to maintain their credentialing, expanding access to the instruction to the students of the college, with community input, and developing a strategic plan to add computer science as a field of study is seen as a means to prepare students for service and employment for and in the community.  TMCC has assembled a highly experienced team of instructional professionals and advisors to conduct the self-study and produce a compelling design for implementation into the college\u2019s STEM degree offerings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
