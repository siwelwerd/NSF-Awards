 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop will be held to discuss opportunities and strategies for promoting ambient energy use in buildings. Experts in ambient energy systems and materials, design, construction, marketing, finance, policy and social science will be assembled to provide their perspectives. The result of the workshop is to be a white paper outlining needs in research, education, and dissemination to increase the use of ambient energy and, thereby, help address the looming climate crisis. The workshop is to be held at DOE in Washington DC, tentatively during July 2023. \r\n\r\nBuildings account for nearly half of US carbon emissions. Further, emissions are projected to increase due to the doubling of built floor area by 2060. All-electric net-zero buildings will not solve the problem, because utilities are expected to still burn fossil fuel for nearly half of all electricity by 2050. Locally harvested ambient energy offers a transformational alternative. Nearly ten times more solar energy is incident on buildings than they consume. A number of historic and modern buildings have been heated and cooled entirely from ambient sources. Solar energy can also heat water, dry clothes, cook food, and provide lighting. 100% solar heating has been proven by numerous buildings over many decades. For current technologies, more wide-spread adoption may require innovations in education, training, marketing, and incentives. Thermal, economic and environmental performance could be advanced by new technologies, including heat pipe systems, polymeric solar collectors, phase change materials, transparent insulation, vacuum-insulated panels, and electrochromic surfaces. Adoption could be enhanced with improved design tools and incorporation into building performance standards and codes. It is estimated that with local ambient energy systems serving demands for which they are well-suited, the remaining need for utility-level electricity could be smaller in 2050 than it is today. The workshop will discuss opportunities and strategies for promoting ambient energy use in buildings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A white paper is under review for publication.</p>\n<p><strong>Defining the problem</strong> - Arguably the greatest challenge of the 21st century is to limit climate change while providing for health, wellbeing and quality of life. Buildings consume 71% of US electricity and 25% of natural gas [EIA 2022], and are responsible for 42% of carbon emissions [Architecture2030 2023]. Addressing buildings is, therefore, an essential component of the climate/energy solution. Electrified, and even net-zero, buildings are insufficient, because grid conversion to renewables is too slow. By 2050, 44% (compared to 60% in 2021) of electricity will still be produced by fossil fuels [EIA 2022]. Energy efficiency is fundamentally incapable of eliminating conventional energy use. Because built floor area will double by 2060 [Global ABC 2017], fossil fuel combustion for buildings will <strong><em>increase</em></strong> if performance standards remain the same. An intervention beyond current strategies is required to change this trajectory.</p>\n<p><strong>The potential of ambient energy</strong> - Ambient energy offers that change. Over half of home energy is for heating and cooling (55% in 2015 [EIA 2018]) (Fig. 1). Other applications for ambient energy include hot water, cooking, drying clothes, daylighting, and refrigeration.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Figure 1</strong></p>\n<p>The solar energy striking a building (Fig. 2) greatly exceeds average US consumption. At its simplest, all it takes to heat a building is allowing solar gains through south-facing windows [Mazria 1979].</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 2</strong><em><br /></em></p>\n<p>Ambient cooling sources include outdoor air, sky and ground (Fig. 3) [Robinson, <em>et al</em>. 2015]. Heat transfer between ambient sources and the building is managed to maintain comfortable indoor temperature (Fig. 4). Thermal mass moderates indoor temperature swings when an appropriate source is unavailable.</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 3</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 4<br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Historic ambient-conditioned buildings</strong> - Classic ~100% ambient buildings include Telkes&rsquo; house, which used building-integrated solar collectors and phase change storage (Fig. 5) [Sherburne 2010, Sharp 2023a]. Hay&rsquo;s house uses a roof pond with moveable insulation to absorb solar energy in the winter and radiate to the sky during summer [Haggard 1977]. Shippee&rsquo;s house is earth-sheltered and has Beadwall windows that fill with insulation at night [Shippee 1979]. Warren used a design similar to Saunders&rsquo; 1981 Shrewsbury, MA house [Shurcliff 1983] with rock-bed storage below the floor and water storage in the attic [Warren 2023].</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 5<br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Modern ambient-conditioned buildings</strong> - Modern houses include those of Riggins [Riggins 2011, 2012, 2017] and Sharp [Sharp 2023b] (Fig. 5). These houses have more insulation, less thermal mass and smaller solar apertures, but have similar ratios of solar gains to envelope losses and similar thermal time constants (ratio of thermal capacitance to envelope losses) [Sharp 2021, 2022]. These ratios are universal for achieving high performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambient energy improves resilience and energy equity</strong> &ndash; Indoor temperature in conventional buildings can quickly reach dangerous levels when the power goes out. With more thermal mass and high levels of insulation, ambient buildings remain comfortable for days, and livable indefinitely, without utility electricity. Low-income families often live in buildings with poor thermal performance and spend approximately three times more on energy than non-low-income [Schaeffer 2022]. Upgrading buildings with ambient conditioning improves energy equity and could save&nbsp; 250 billion USD per year.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambient energy is cheaper</strong> - An all-renewable US electric grid will cost 8 - 21 trillion USD [Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2019, Gielen <em>et al</em>. 2021]. The fraction devoted to space conditioning alone is 14,000 &ndash; 50,000 USD per building. By comparison, historical passive solar homes cost 4-8% extra to construct [Balcomb 1992]. Riggins&rsquo; house (Fig. 5) cost about 5,000 USD extra for nearly 100% ambient conditioning, up to 10 times less than that of expanding the renewable grid to serve the same load.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong> &ndash; The white paper contains specific recommendations for promoting ambient energy through policy, codes and standards, education, design software, research, and demonstration.</p>\n<p><strong>References bibliography available upon request (brian.robinson@louisville.edu)<br /></strong></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/23/2024<br>\nModified by: Brian&nbsp;S&nbsp;Robinson</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2318673/2318673_10849397_1713895453734_Figure_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2318673/2318673_10849397_1713895453734_Figure_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2318673/2318673_10849397_1713895453734_Figure_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Average solar radiation on horizontal and south-facing vertical surfaces compared to mean residential and commercial building energy use rates.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Authors</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Brian&nbsp;S&nbsp;Robinson\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2318673/2318673_10849397_1713895605392_Figure_5--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2318673/2318673_10849397_1713895605392_Figure_5--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2318673/2318673_10849397_1713895605392_Figure_5--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Six entirely or nearly 100% ambient-conditioned homes.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Authors</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Brian&nbsp;S&nbsp;Robinson\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 5</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2318673/2318673_10849397_1713895552350_Figure_4--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2318673/2318673_10849397_1713895552350_Figure_4--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2318673/2318673_10849397_1713895552350_Figure_4--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Indoor comfort is maintained by regulating gains from a hot source and losses to a cold sink.
