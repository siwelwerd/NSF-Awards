 "awd_abstract_narration": "Improving the societal benefits of science requires systematic attention to the ways in which research is conducted and how different approaches may result in various kinds and degrees of impact. Existing studies on research impact drivers suggest that more engaged approaches\u2014where researchers meaningfully collaborate with societal partners during the research process\u2014can increase the use of research to support decision-making. However, we know relatively little about how various forms or levels of engagement result in different societal benefits in the real world; some types of engagement may even be harmful or counterproductive. Improving understanding in this area requires empirical and critical study of the types of engaged research and their outcomes. A primary aim of this project is to build connections and coordination capacity among the many approaches to understanding, supporting, and improving engaged research and its uses. The team will convene scholars and institutional leaders across sectors to synthesize existing evidence and identify future directions related to the impacts and uses of engaged research.\r\n\r\nThe heart of this project involves planning, execution, and follow-on reporting from an interdisciplinary and solutions-oriented workshop facilitated. The workshop will convene a small group of experts from a diverse range of disciplines, issue areas, geographies, and types of expertise for a weeklong intensive dialogue. The participants (n = approx. 30) will work together to synthesize existing knowledge, identify gaps, build understanding and connections, and forge next steps on the relationship among 1) the quality, intensity, and longevity of engagement in the research process, 2) research impact (e.g., use of evidence in decision making), and 3) outcomes of interest (e.g., improved health or educational outcomes). The output from this meeting will include a report and a call to action intended to inspire and inform decision-making at scientific institutions, including the National Science Foundation, keenly interested in expanding their support for engaged research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
