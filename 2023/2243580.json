 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent decades, many marine species in Caribbean coral reef ecosystems have been impacted by disease. A well-documented mass mortality event affecting the long-spined black sea urchin Diadema antillarum in the early 1980s stands out because it had wide-ranging impacts on reef ecosystems. The urchins function as gatekeeper grazers, feeding mainly on macroalgae and preventing algae from overgrowing reefs. In the 1980s, an unknown disease killed over 90% of these urchins across the Caribbean, changing the reefscape from coral to algal dominated. Nearly 40 years later, black sea urchin populations have yet to recover. In early 2022, a new mortality event of D. antillarum was reported along the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico. This RAPID project is identifying the microbes involved in the current mortality event. The investigators are also assessing urchin populations under contrasting environmental conditions and disease incidences. Results are providing a better understanding of the causes and consequences of disease in Diadema, and insights learned may help prevent or mitigate future mortality events. The project is providing training for underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in microbiology, bioinformatics, biochemistry, and ecology.\r\n\r\nWith use of multi-omics technology, this RAPID project is advancing our understanding of the current die-off of Diadema in the Caribbean, including host-pathogen interactions and how these are influenced by environmental factors. The investigators are pursuing the following questions: (1) Are the microbial and biochemical profiles of diseased urchins similar to healthy ones? (2) Do environmental factors, i.e., temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen, influence disease incidence? (3) Are different size classes of urchins differentially being affected by the disease? This project is focusing on four study sites along the eastern and northern coast of Puerto Rico, where demographic and biochemical data have been previously collected. At three-month intervals, healthy and diseased D. antillarum urchins are being evaluated for changes in the microbiome using metagenomic and untargeted metabolomic strategies. In addition, urchins from eight transects per site are being counted and measured to determine how disease modulates life-history traits, i.e., population size-structure and density, and to assess disease incidence. The relationship between disease incidence and environmental measurements is being assessed. These multidisciplinary approaches and cutting-edge techniques, combined with the existing demographic and microbial data, make this a one-of-a-kind project to study the progression and effects of the disease at the metabolic, microbial, population, and ecosystem levels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

No diseased D. antillarum individuals were observed and, therefore, have been collected thus far. The population size structure and density of the sea urchin across all sites were also estimated during the field trips. Adverse weather conditions have prevented us from estimating the coral cover in northern sites during the late summer/early fall surveys. Nevertheless, we have successfully completed these estimates for eastern sites.The fieldwork was carried out by a dedicated team consisting of Carlos Toledo-Hernandez (CTH), Claudia P. Ruiz-Diaz (CPRD), Ruber Rodriguez-Barreras (RRB), Samuel Suleiman-Ramos (SSR), and Marcos A. Qui?ones (MAQ) and four volunteers.</p>\n<p><strong>DNA and Metabolites extration:</strong> DNA/Metabolites from the the collected individuals, plus the water and sediment samples have been extracted and storaged accordingly.The molecular and biochemical analyses must align with the completion of sample collection. This ensures that all the necessary samples, including sea urchin tissue, water, and sediment, are gathered before commencing these precise sequencing analyses. This approach minimizes the risk of errors and ensures accurate and reliable results. Lab work has been completed by Filipa Godoy-Vitorino (FGV) and Nataliya Chorna (NC), and Elif Kardas (EKA).
