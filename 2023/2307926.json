This workshop will bring together a diverse group of researchers, including modelers and observational scientists, to identify research priorities and approaches for improving source attribution of observed greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, with a focus on modeling and improved understanding of surface-level processes. The workshop will take place over two days and the primary output will be a report to guide future research in this area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
