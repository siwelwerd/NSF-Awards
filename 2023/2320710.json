 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award is for the acquisition of a profiling cloud radar.  Cloud radars transmit shorter wavelengths than traditional weather radars and are more sensitive to small scatterers, like cloud droplets and even insects.  The radar will be incorporated into the University of Alabama in Huntsville\u2019s (UAH) Mobile Atmospheric Profiling Network (MAPNet) facility which is available for wide community usage.  This radar will complement the existing MAPNet remote sensing instrumentation and allow users to address a variety of new science topics.  The radar will be used for hands-on educational experiences for students and enhance outreach activities.  \r\n\r\nThis award is for the acquisition of a Ka-band profiling radar (KaPR) that would be integrated into UAH\u2019s MAPNet.  MAPNet is part of the current AGS Community Instrument and Facility (CIF) cohort and is available for deployment by members of the scientific community supported by NSF.  MAPNet currently lacks a cloud radar, which would provide important information on cloud depth/top, cloud water phase, refined estimates of cloud water content, precipitation characteristics, and hydrometeor type.  The specific instrument to be acquired is the ProSensing dual antenna Quadratic Phase Coded, continuous wave radar.  This new radar has improved signal to noise ratio, lower range sidelobes, and a much smaller minimum range.  The research team has identified the following areas of study that could be enhanced by the use of KaPR:  cool season stratocumulus clouds, convective system environments, cloud electrification, hurricane boundary layers, aerosol-cloud interactions, convective snow bands, mammatus clouds, and biological flyers.  \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Physical and Dynamic Meteorology program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
