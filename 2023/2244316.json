 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Summary:\r\n\r\nSemiconductors, like silicon, are fascinating materials with unique electrical properties on which modern computer chips are fabricated before being incorporated into products like computers, smartphones, medical devices, and automobiles.  However, the vast majority of computer chip manufacturing currently takes place outside of the United States, which presents significant economic and cyber security concerns. Moreover, advancements in new materials are driving innovations in computing technologies, which will  drive advancements in next-generation computing devices.  The Materials Science and Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) will host a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site titled \u201cMaterials for Future Computing\u201d that supports the development of an engaged and qualified workforce for the semiconductor industry.  Working with local colleges and minority serving institutions (MSIs), the site welcomes students from diverse backgrounds who have not historically had as many opportunities to conduct scientific research. Participants take a hands-on approach to learning about the structure and properties of electronic materials as well as the fundamentals of nanofabrication processes relevant to the computer chip industry.  The experience incorporates field trips to local companies and direct use of the state-of-the-art CMU Materials Characterization and Nanofabrication facilities.  Students attend regular seminars to learn about best practices in conducting research and are paired with a research mentor to work on an individual research project, which is communicated in a final closing ceremony.  The program perpetually evaluates the student experience including outcomes beyond the 10-week period so that the long-term goals of the program are tracked.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary:\r\n\r\nThe Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site \u2013 Materials for Future Computing - exposes students to state of the art facilities for nanofabrication and advanced structural characterization of materials.  As highlighted in the SRC 2020 Decadal Plan for Semiconductors, energy consumed from computation could soon be comparable to global energy production. Thus, the discovery, fabrication, and characterization of new materials is paramount to improving the energy-efficiency of modern computers. The Materials for Future Computing experience leverages existing CMU facilities including the Carnegie Mellon nanofabrication facility (CMNF) and Materials Characterization Facility (MCF).  Students are paired with a faculty research mentor where they will conduct research on an individual project related to electronic materials.  In addition to the individual research projects, students are offered a range of universal experiences including weekly tutorials related to best practices in research, weekly workshops held within MCF and CMNF including three off campus field trips, regular collegial meetings, and roundtable discussions with the PIs. A primary objective of this proposal is to expand opportunities to students who have historically not had equitable opportunities to pursue scientific research.  The proposed REU site takes steps to recruit underrepresented minorities (URMs) and promote gender diversity through outreach to minority serving institutions (MSIs) and existing engineering professional societies.  The Principal Investigators work with local colleges in the Greater Pittsburgh Area that have limited research opportunities and do not offer graduate school programs including 2-year community colleges.  The long-term impact of this site is to broaden the participation of students in engineering and to strengthen research and development in the semiconductor industry in the United States.\r\n\r\nThis Site is supported in part by funds provided to the National Science Foundation by the Semiconductor Research Corporation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
