Approximation Theory has emerged as an interdisciplinary research area with significant impacts on various fields. Applications areas at the conference will range from computer-aided geometric design to image and signal processing, geophysical and medical modeling, and data science.   This conference will help identify emerging trends and opportunities for future research that will likely impact these application areas in addition to other applications in science, engineering, and information technology. Additionally, the conference aims to promote the career development of graduate students, early-career mathematicians, women, and minorities, and aim to provide a platform for their integration into the scientific community.\r\n\r\nThe field of Approximation Theory provides common links and tools across the mathematical sciences, natural and life sciences, and engineering. Its importance has grown considerably in recent years with new developments and broad applications through wavelets, frames, radial basis functions, spline functions and more. The goal of the conference is to highlight computational mathematics in this area and its connections to interdisciplinary research areas. The conference will focus on the latest state-of-the-art developments in learning theory with application to signal/image processing, computer-aided design, manufacturing and related areas.   The insights gained from the discussions and presentations at the conference will likely lead to new research directions and opportunities, ultimately resulting in the development of innovative solutions to important problems in diverse areas of science and technology. The conference website is located at https://my.vanderbilt.edu/nashville2023.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
