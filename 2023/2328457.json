 "awd_abstract_narration": "The HDF5 User group (HUG) meeting 2023, to be held in Columbus, OH from August 16-18th, 2023, will bring together a diverse set of experts to discuss the design, development, and usage of HDF5 libraries and tools that form an ecosystem based on HDF5. The associated presentations and discussions bring a plethora of opportunities for graduate students working in HPC and experimental / observational data management and analysis to get a range of benefits. The HUG meeting is unique in nature. The event will include a set of invited talks from researchers, users, and library developers, who are experts in the field. The event also includes contributed presentations that are submitted through an open call for presentation and selected by the HUG organizing team. The event also contains tutorials and presentations from the HDF5 Group and expert HDF5 developers on tuning and optimization strategies for various HDF5 library components and troubleshooting guidelines. The HUG meeting is organized by a leading group of experts in HDF5 and data management technologies. The project will fund students to participate in the meeting, to engage with the HDF5 research and user community. The funding provided by NSF will have a significant impact on increasing readiness of students for entering the workforce at national laboratories, HPC centers, cloud companies, and academia.\r\n\r\nHDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format version 5) provides a data model, library, and file format for storing and managing data. Due to the versatility of its data model, and its portability, longevity, and efficiency, hundreds of thousands of scientific applications use HDF5 as part of their data management solution. The HUG 2023 meeting organizers are recruiting students wishing to participate in the event from a diverse set of institutions. To increase the participation from the under-represented communities in computer science, the event organizers will engage with communities such as The Ohio LSAMP Alliance. Prospective participants will have to apply, and submissions are evaluated by a committee for scientific merit and for promoting diversity. The students will get several benefits from attending the event, including: (1) exposure to the latest data management, analysis, and I/O technologies (computing platforms, accelerators, and networks), their features, and their impact on designing HPC, cloud, and edge computing software environments; (2) in-depth exposure to the challenges and techniques in designing, developing, and maintaining open-source software environments for HPC systems and cloud environments; (3) exposure to the sustainability aspects of software development; (4) training on systematic tuning and optimization of data management and storage software stacks.; and (5) Interaction with national laboratory and industry professionals related to data management. The project will promote the progress of science as it provides a forum to disseminate research efforts, connect researchers, and train the next generation of diverse workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
