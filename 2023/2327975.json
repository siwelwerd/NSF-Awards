This seminar is associated with the Metals in Biology Gordon Research Conference (MIB GRC), programmed for January 21-26, 2024. GRCs are organized to facilitate the presentation, sharing, and discussion of the most recent and exciting scientific advances in a field. The long-term goals of this seminar are to foster interactions and collaborations among the graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who share common research interests. To accomplish this, these meetings are relatively small (usually less than 200 participants) and have built-in unstructured time for conferees to meet for further discussion. Furthermore, ample discussion time is scheduled after each talk, and knowledgeable and dynamic leaders are carefully chosen to lead and facilitate discussions. The meeting agenda includes ample time for discussion at oral and poster presentations and flexible time for informal discussions among attendees. The presentation of new, unpublished results is emphasized to ensure that forefront science is highlighted. The Metals in Biology community is committed to equity and inclusion and will advance these goals in the meeting organization and process. The meeting will include a Power Hour for the discussion of promoting underrepresented minorities advancement in science, and early-career speakers will be included in the program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
