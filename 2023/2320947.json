 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF\u2019s Eddie Bernice Johnson INCLUDES Initiative motivates and accelerates collaborative infrastructure building for systems change that broadens participation in STEM. A key part of the INCLUDES Initiative investment is building and strengthening a National Network. This National Network is a collaboration of agencies, organizations, individuals, and projects working together to design, implement, study, refine, and scale up collaborative change models and strategies. NSF\u2019s Eddie Bernice Johnson INCLUDES Coordination Hub (the Hub) leads and supports National Network members in building capacity, developing and sharing knowledge, and making connections to advance the use of collaborative infrastructure for systems change in STEM. The Hub inspires innovative solutions to deep-seated challenges and expands the vision of what is possible. The Hub\u2019s work catalyzes a movement that takes actionable steps to transform policies, practices, relationships, approaches, and mindsets to broaden participation in STEM in support of the INCLUDES Initiative vision of a STEM workforce that reflects the diversity of the nation.\r\n\r\nUsing a liberatory design framework, the Hub supports INCLUDES-funded projects, shares learnings, and facilitates connections across the National Network. The Hub serves as a backbone for an incubator of INCLUDES-funded Alliances and Collaborative Change Consortia that tests new concepts, practices, and policies. The Hub employs a thematic approach to equity-driven systems change; amplifies and elevates the voices and experiences of marginalized populations; takes a holistic approach to shared measures, including qualitative and quantitative data and storytelling; and employs strategic research and communications. The Hub\u2019s work is growing and strengthening the National Network into a vibrant ecosystem and national resource for demonstrably broadening participation in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
