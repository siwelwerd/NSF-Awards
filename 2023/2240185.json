 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports the development and implementation of a research platform for use in quantum computing and quantum networking. It focuses on studying and realizing quantum bits (qubits) in a new materials platform: superlattices of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides. In these materials, when one layer is rotated relative to another and then stacked on top of it, a superlattice is formed, which can act as a platform for realizing a 2-dimensional array of quantum dots or qubits that could be used in quantum communication or for quantum simulations. These quantum dots are amenable to optical readout, however, a challenge this grant addresses is that the dots are closely spaced, making it hard to address them individually. This project realizes a platform that combines the ability to control the superlattice through rotation of interlayer twist angle with a near-field scanning optical probe to address individual quantum dots, demonstrating a uniquely scalable approach to synthesizing large arrays of qubits. This project serves an important role of training a diverse quantum workforce through its support of PhD trainees, through providing internship opportunities for participants in local NSF traineeship programs, and through opening opportunities for undergraduate involvement.\r\n\r\nTo fulfill the promise of quantum-enabled computing and communications, it is imperative to manufacture high quality, on-demand single photon emitters that can be directly coupled to qubits. Beyond the coupling, these emitters should be amenable to efficient read-out to enable transfer of quantum information between disparate quantum nodes. Moir\u00e9 superlattices of 2D semiconductors, such as transition metal dichalcogenide, feature unique capabilities beneficial for addressing these challenges. In a moir\u00e9 superlattice, the periodic alignment and misalignment of crystal lattices produces an array of optically active quantum dots which host single emitters. These emitters exist in a planar crystal and do not rely on crystal defects, giving the advantage of scalability, electrical tunability, and optimized photon extraction efficiency. This project develops an approach to manufacture moir\u00e9 quantum dot arrays by dynamic control of the layer twist-angle and efficiently address individual dots via near-field optical read-out. A successful demonstration of this quantum manufacturing platform positions moir\u00e9 emitters as ideal systems for single photon emitters and optical quantum simulators.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
