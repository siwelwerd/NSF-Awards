 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract: \r\nScientists have made remarkable advancements in developing materials suitable for use in our bodies, such as medical devices and implants. However, there is a significant challenge related to the risk of infection when these devices are placed inside bodies. When bacteria infiltrate the surface of the body through the area where the device is located, it can cause infections that are hard to treat and can even be life-threatening. This obstacle hampers the progress of developing improved medical devices. To address this problem, this NSF project aims to create medical devices that can effectively prevent microbial colonization. Here, advanced hybrid composite biomaterials will be designed to make the devices resistant to bacteria. The research team will study how bacteria that typically stick to surfaces in human mouths respond to these novel biomaterials by examining their biochemical, physical, and physiological reactions to the electric signals produced by these materials. By developing these innovative and environmentally friendly materials, the team hopes to create medical devices that are better at preventing infections. This will contribute to making healthcare safer and more effective for everyone. This research project will be accompanied by education and outreach activities that aim to bring together students and professionals from engineering and dental medicine fields to promote Growing Convergence Research. In particular, these activities will focus on fostering the next generation of underrepresented groups in STEM, which will create a more inclusive and innovative scientific community.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: This collaborative NSF project represents an innovative multidisciplinary experimental program that connects material science, electrical engineering, and oral microbiology. The overarching objective is to investigate cutting-edge multifunctional biomaterial platforms with the capacity to prevent biofilm formation on medical devices. To this end, the research objectives are aimed at i) advancing hybrid metal-piezoelectric nanocomposites for implantable medical devices by integrating various metallic and piezoelectric components, ii) elucidating the underlying mechanism of the antibiofilm activity of metal-piezoelectric nanocomposites, and iii) validating the antibiofilm activity using in vitro mixed-species and ex vivo saliva-driven oral biofilm models. In-depth analyses of microbial biochemical, physical, and physiological responses to electric potentials derived from advanced hybrid biomaterial will be investigated. The proposed biomaterial platform will likely render an effective, innovative, and ecological biofilm prevention strategy, achieved through the integration of diverse metals and piezoelectric materials without relying on broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. The central ideas explored in this project are also incorporated into education and outreach initiatives, including i) mentoring young researchers in minority communities and 2) integrating research and education for students and professionals in dental medicine and engineering. Promoting inclusivity and diversity in STEM education will create a capable and diverse workforce that can contribute to scientific advancements and innovation in the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
