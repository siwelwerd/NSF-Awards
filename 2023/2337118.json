 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ice forms on surfaces in cold and humid environments through various processes, including the freezing of condensed vapor and deposited airborne droplets. The fundamental understanding of the ice formation and ice removal on soft surfaces will lead to development of more effective anti-icing surfaces. The proposed research will contribute to improving the robustness of national infrastructures against icing. This study has the potential to enhance ice-resistant sensors for machines and drones exposed to extreme manufacturing conditions or outdoor weather. \r\n\r\nCurrent approaches to icing problems are limited by the incorporation of rigid surface textures and/or coatings. This project aims to visualize and understand the water freezing processes on soft materials (such as a layer of synthetic hair) under the forced convection of humid air. An advanced X-ray imaging technique will be used to visualize the phase change processes and droplet dynamics under heat convection conditions. The in-situ observation of ice formation and its removal on soft surfaces will generate valuable insights spanning various fields, including transportation, renewable energy, and telecommunication.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
