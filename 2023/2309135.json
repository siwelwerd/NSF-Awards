 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (KITP) at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), serves the global theoretical physics community via a unique structure and mode of operation. KITP drives interactions with long-stay, scientist-curated programs for the broad and diverse physics community. This extended exposure of program participants to scientific peers stimulates collaborative networks that advance the intellectual enterprise of physics. As a largely peer-managed institute, with essential input from the community in the planning and implementation of its research programs, the KITP responds to new scientific opportunities, encourages transformational research, and promotes diversity by ensuring broad opportunities and representation. In order to bring forefront physics to as large an audience as possible, the KITP has developed the capability to record all talks, seminars, discussions and public lectures and provide them to the world-wide community. KITP Online hosts over 21,000 talks and is watched for more than 400 hours every day of the year, dramatically increasing its impact.\r\n\r\nThe KITP is a user facility, with the NSF, UCSB, and other substantial private foundation grants supporting the visitors' expenses and the staff and infrastructure needed to support the programs. In a typical year, the KITP runs 12 research programs, lasting from four weeks to four months. There are always two overlapping programs, resulting in 24,000 visitor-days per year and an average of 68 visitors at the KITP at any time. The KITP is a window to the world and a prime example of international scientific cooperation. Most long programs also host a short conference, providing an opportunity for approximately 60-80 additional researchers to come to the KITP. KITP includes the opportunity for graduate students to participate by supporting visits when their mentors are present. Motivated by the lessons learned during the lock-down period of the pandemic, KITP offers a hybrid attendance opportunity for all programs and conferences. The activities at the KITP also enhance the careers of those who participate, allowing for new mentors and mentees to be discovered as well as raising the profiles of early-career researchers.  This award is co-funded by the Division of Physics, the Division of Materials Research, and the Division of Astronomical Sciences within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
