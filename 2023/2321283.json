 "awd_abstract_narration": "The funded project supports early-career scientists to attend the 6th International Symposium for Plant Signaling and Behavior (PSB2023).  This symposium is hosted by the Society for Plant Signaling and Behavior and is noted for being an inclusive and provocative, stimulating symposium.  Funds will be offered on a competitive basis to early-career women from groups not well represented in science.  Applications will be reviewed by the symposium Organizing Committee and awarded based on accomplishment and need for support.  Awardees will be introduced at a special session for discussing future research agendas for the field of Plant Behavior.  Each will be expected to participate in moderating a group of 10 scientists, modelling \u2018active learning\u2019 in a classroom set up for this purpose.  This activity will occur on the first day of the symposium and will jump-start conversations among participants and funded scholars.  It is particularly useful to bring this group of scientists to the PSB2023 symposium for their novel perspectives and the likelihood that participating in this group will enhance their careers as scientists.\r\n\r\nFunds will be used to support participation of early-career scientists in the 6th International Symposium for Plant Signaling and Behavior.  Plant Signaling and Behavior is an emerging field of biological research, integrating knowledge about signaling mechanisms, genetics and electrophysiology to test hypotheses about whole plant behavior and ecology.  Arising from these studies are questions about cognition, awareness, and coordination of sensory input into responsive behavior.  Here, basic plant biological mechanisms are explored in conjunction with modelling, behavioral studies, neurobiology and philosophy.  The planned symposium will create an opportunity to focus current questions on rigorous science.  Inclusion of philosophers of science and cognition will guide this process.  As this field becomes more mainstream, with participation of high-profile scientists from adjacent fields, it is important to include early-career scientists in the discussion.  Also particularly germane to this group is the inclusion of women scientists, as most of the leaders of the Society for Plant Signaling and Behavior have been men to date.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe Plant Signaling and Behavior Symposium 2023 was held in Seattle at the University of Washington June 19-23, 2023. The National Science Foundation provided support to recruit emerging scientists, females from underrepresented groups, to participate and speak at this Symposium. The funding was advertised on the Symposium website, including directions for applying. Applications were reviewed by three members of the Symposium organizing committee. Ten offers were made and eight accepted; two were withdrawn due to last-minute travel complications. Separate funds were added to support two male applicants. All awardees were in training at the graduate or post-doctoral level. The NSF grant provided funds for travel and lodging at the Symposium for each of the awardees.The eight NSF-funded scientists attended the symposium and were invited to speak. A special session was organized for introduction of these scientists to the larger group: in the afternoon of the second day June 20, a facilitated discussion was held on the topic of Challenges for Plant BEhavior Research. The NSF-funded scientists led the facilitation which followed an active-learning format. This gave each of them an opportunity to introduce themselves to a small group of participants and then interface with that small group and the larger group as a whole. Afterwards, each of the NSF-funded scientists was well known and welcomed within the whole group, many of whom had known each other for years. One result of the discussion, and of putting forward these emerging scientists, was focus on ways of taking the science of plant behavior research forward. For those who chose to speak, NSF and the Symposium gave them a rare opportunity to present their work to an international audience of senior scientists. This was welcomed by all.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/12/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ElizabethVan Volkenburgh\n"
