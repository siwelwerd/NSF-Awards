 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an ExpandAI Capacity building pilot (CAP), which focuses on establishment of a robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure at Texas A&M University-San Antonio, thereby enhancing the research capacity of the institution and facilitating AI-focused educational curriculum development and training. Towards this goal, the project will launch two initiatives: (1) Foundational and Use-Inspired AI Research Initiative and (2) AI for All Education and Training Initiative.  The \u201cFoundational and Use-Inspired AI Research Initiative\u201d focuses on research aimed at improving healthcare quality of life, transforming national defense-security, and effective utilization of cloud computing resources. The \u201cAI for All Education and Training Initiative\u201d aims to generate interest, increase awareness, and advance careers in AI among underrepresented minority groups, including women, by developing curricula & providing training to faculty and researchers.\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s multiple inter-connected AI research threads in healthcare, cybersecurity and cloud computing, are crucial to meeting future societal expectations. The expected outcomes of the project will include (i) novel contributions to research for enhanced reliability and trustworthiness of automated medical imaging; (ii) reduced risks of running software containing malware on cloud and (iii) efficient utilization of cloud-based AI-ML resources. The ExpandAI Program supports AI-powered education and workforce development, infrastructure and research at Minority Serving Institutions to strengthen and diversify U.S. research and education pathways and provide historically marginalized communities with new opportunities in STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
