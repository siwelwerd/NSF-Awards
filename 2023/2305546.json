 "awd_abstract_narration": "Central Michigan University's (CMU) ADVANCE Adaptation project aims to improve the workplace culture and climate for STEM faculty at CMU. This project is informed by an institutional self-assessment that identified opportunities to enhance the institution\u2019s ability to recruit highly qualified STEM faculty to CMU and to ensure that they are retained and thrive at CMU. The project includes three initiatives: 1) creating an \u201cadvocates and allies\u201d program, 2) ensuring transparent and fair policies and procedures, and 3) developing more welcoming faculty recruitment practices and mentoring opportunities. These initiatives are evidence-based informed by the relevant research literature and/or adapted from other ADVANCE institutions.\r\n\r\nThe CMU ADVANCE project will result in several tools that may be beneficial to other institutions such as a self-assessment checklist, based on the literature, for departmental by-law reviews and a faculty recruitment and hiring toolkit.  The project has support from institutional leadership and is designed to be sustainable. This work is expected to build an institutional culture of equity, transparent policies, and improved recruitment and mentoring practices that will benefit all faculty and students at CMU.\r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.  ADVANCE \"Adaptation\" awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based strategies to academic, non-profit institutions of higher education as well as non-academic, non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
