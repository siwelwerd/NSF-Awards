 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies how biological macromolecules are able to efficiently promote and utilize non-trivial quantum phenomena at or near room temperatures that are necessary for function. This project will provide a new understanding for how biology integrates quantum behavior into macromolecular function. There is also the potential to inform and aid the advancement of new quantum science and technologies, such as the development of de novo systems that harness quantum phenomena. This project puts forth a highly collaborative, synergistic research approach entailing a multi-disciplinary study in structural biology, protein biochemistry, enzymology, chemistry, and physics. Mentorship is key to the success of this project with multi-layered training opportunities, built on the principles of \u201cteam science\u201d, available to postdoctoral trainees as well as graduate and undergraduate students. The project will also develop an innovative, cross-institutional, course-based research experience to be implemented in the undergraduate curriculum. This effort will be aimed at biology-focused and primarily underrepresented students who will be engaged in research that is related to non-trivial quantum effects in biology.\r\n\r\n\r\nProteins, and possibly other macromolecules, have evolved in a manner to initiate, sustain, enhance, and/or communicate quantum phenomena, including tunneling and spin coherence. A full mechanistic understanding into how nature accomplishes these interactions, and how it leads to a biological outcome, resides in the successful interplay between the scaffold of the protein and active site quantum behavior. Investigations within this project will draw on cutting edge advances in experimentation, including time-resolved and temperature-dependent structural studies coupled with functional assays, and theory to create a complementary and holistic data-driven understanding of the relationship between energy flow in a protein structure and either thermal or light initiation of quantum behavior. The research focuses on two disparate protein systems with distinct folds and complementary quantum effects \u2013 hydrogen tunneling in lipoxygenase catalysis and spin coherence in cryptochromes associated with magnetoreception and circadian clocks. The underlying theme of the research will be the identification and mapping of anisotropic protein networks that control vibrational motions and/or conformational changes linked to a productive output. The principles that emerge from this research go beyond the scope of hydrogen tunneling and spin coherence, by expanding our knowledge base of function-coupled thermal and light activated protein networks. The resulting insights could potentially be leveraged to encode new functionalities into (re)designed proteins. This project is supported by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
