 "awd_abstract_narration": "The motivations behind this project are two-fold.  It is driven by the growing role of computing as an essential tool in devising solutions to the many major societal problems created by climate change.  At the same time, it is an acknowledgment of the fact that, in spite of its positive role, computing is itself facing sustainability challenges as well as contributing to some of the factors behind climate change.  Fostering the development of new initiatives addressing those problems and challenges is the main goal of this project. The project\u2019s novelties lie in jointly addressing the dual role of computing as an enabler of solutions to climate change as well as a contributor to climate change itself, and in exploring the challenges faced by the interdisciplinary teams needed to develop effective approaches.  The project\u2019s impacts are similarly two-fold:  It will help prioritize new research directions where computing can have a transformative role in developing solutions to climate change challenges and it will increase awareness of the need for computing to account for sustainability in its own development.\r\n\r\nTowards realizing the project\u2019s goals, the investigators rely on a two-prong approach.  The project\u2019s first phase consists of an open information gathering effort conducted virtually (online) towards identifying critical, yet poorly explored sustainability problems that computing can help address. The second phase seeks to develop a concrete agenda for not only addressing those challenges, but equally importantly help build and sustain the interdisciplinary scientific community that successfully tackling them requires.  This second phase is in the form of a workshop bringing together not only researchers across the required disciplines, but also researchers with expertise in building interdisciplinary teams and team science towards informing the creation and sustainability of successful teams involving participants across multiple disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The workshops goals were to (i) advance the development of research initiatives along the themes of both sustainable computing and computing for sustainability, while also (ii) helping develop guidance on how to sustain the interdisciplinary teams those initiatives would need.\n\n\nSustainable computing targets making computing itself more sustainable, e.g., by lowering the energy consumption of data centers that have become major consumers of electricity. Conversely, computing for sustainability seeks to leverage the power of computing to help study and hopefully mitigate the many sustainability challenges we currently face, e.g., develop better and more accurate climate models or improve crop yields by monitoring soil composition and adjusting watering, fertilization, and application of pesticides in real-time.\n\n\nCommon to both sustainable computing and computing for sustainability is the fact that (effective) solutions call for combining expertise and perspectives from multiple disciplines. This is certainly true for the technical side of the problems, e.g., developing solutions that adjust crop watering in real-time requires a combination of software and hardware skills, as well as knowledge of crop science. But it extends beyond the realm of engineering and commonly involves aspects of policy, social engineering, economics, etc. Knowing how to combine and, equally important, keep together such disparate expertise can be a challenge in its own right. Exploring and developing guidance on those issues and bringing together individuals with the mix of backgrounds and expertise required to tackle those problems were the primary goals of the workshop.\n\n\nThe workshops impact is likely to accrue over time as a result of the work it will, hopefully, help initiate, which should span both science and society.
