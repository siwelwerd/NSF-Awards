 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the advancement of perovskite solar cell technology, making it more accessible and affordable for a wider range of applications. The project's innovative functionalized inks address key challenges in perovskite solar cell manufacturing, including cost reduction and compatibility with various layers in the solar cell stack. By offering a cost-effective, high-quality solution for solar cell manufacturers, the project can promote the adoption of renewable energy technologies, ultimately leading to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and decreased reliance on fossil fuels. The commercial impact of this project extends to startups and established companies within the perovskite solar cell industry, as it enables them to produce solar modules at a lower cost, creating a more competitive market and driving innovation.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of functionalized metal-oxide charge transport layers for solar cells, which offer a significant reduction in layer costs and facilitate solution-phase processing. The project's core innovation is the functionalization of nanoparticles with acetate ligands, allowing for dispersion in perovskite-compatible anhydrous ethanol and providing unmatched process flexibility. This innovative approach overcomes the challenges of solvent incompatibility and processing temperature constraints that have limited the choice of materials for charge transport layers. The resulting dispersion is not only cost-effective, but also compatible with low-temperature processing techniques, making it an ideal solution for flexible solar applications. The project also explores the potential of functionalized nitrogen oxide as an alternative, offering similar advantages in cost, stability, and manufacturability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
