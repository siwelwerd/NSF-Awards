The conference will be held in Pittsburgh July 10-14 with the doctoral consortium taking place July 10th & 11th.  The annual Designing Interactive Systems (DIS) conference, sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery\u2019s Special Interest Group on Computer Human Interaction (ACM SIGCHI), is the premier international forum where approximately 350 interdisciplinary HCI researchers and practitioners from around the world come together each year to debate and shape the future of interactive systems design. Research contributions are peer-reviewed and widely cited.\r\n\r\nThe ACM DIS Doctoral Consortium is an important forum to help strengthen and advance diverse contributions to scholarship and practice from young and emerging researchers from a range of backgrounds. Students selected to participate in the event will have the opportunity to present, discuss and receive feedback on their research with a panel of five senior, internationally recognized, and distinguished researchers. They will be able to take part in the entire conference, will present a poster of their work, and will interact with an international audience of interdisciplinary researchers and industry professionals in HCI, design research, and interactive systems.  The 2023 event will be the first opportunity for an in-person and in-situ workshop since 2019.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
