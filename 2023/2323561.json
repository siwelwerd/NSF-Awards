The workshop will be held in October, 2023, building on international momentum to support this multidisciplinary subduction zone research.\r\n\r\nSubduction zones are a natural laboratory to investigate a number of significant geohazards that pose risk to society, including earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and mass wasting events. Facilitating international collaboration and fostering new connections between early career scientists will enable the multidisciplinary and international science of subduction zones. The workshop\u2019s structure is designed to train and support students and early career scientists who are starting their careers in subduction zone science by: (1) providing them an overview of state-of-the-art science; (2) training them in using novel methodologies and approaches; and (3) creating opportunities to make new connections with colleagues from around the world. The travel support will be broadly advertised though various venues that support sciences related to subduction zones and earthquakes processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
