 "awd_abstract_narration": "According to well-established theory, earthquakes may start with very slow movement (or \"slip\") along a fault, which suddenly accelerates to the violently rapid slip that can generate ground shaking. Slow slip has been seen before large earthquakes, but it is usually different from what the theories predict. Dr. McLaskey and his team will use laboratory experiments and computer models to measure and understand slow slip and tiny earthquakes that happen along faults before a large earthquake.  In the laboratory experiments, a ten-foot slab of rock with a cut (fault) embedded in it is compressed and sheared using a giant press, making the fault creep and then slip suddenly in \"laboratory\" earthquakes. The experiments can test how realistic, non-uniform fault properties\u2014like rough versus slippery sections, or bumps and bends\u2014can play a role in providing warning signs of an impending earthquake. Computer models will be developed to understand and explain data collected during the laboratory earthquake experiments. To check how well these computer models perform, they will be tested against a large collection of data on slow pre-earthquake slip and earthquakes that are ocurring beneath a glacier in Antarctica. As part of this project, three graduate students and at least two undergraduates will receive training in earthquake science (experiments, modeling, and data analysis).\r\n\r\nHeterogeneous fault properties\u2014bumps, bends, differing lithology, and heterogeneous loading conditions that exist at a variety of scales\u2014are generally not considered in earthquake nucleation theories, but have been shown to strongly influence the way an earthquake initiates. On a heterogeneous fault, neighboring fault patches reach failure at different times, often resulting in the propagation of slow slip fronts that may only be detectable as a gradual decrease in seismic coupling, such as that observed prior to the M 9 Tohoku Earthquake, or from the migration and coalescence of microseismicity. This project explores the behavior of heterogeneous faults late in the earthquake cycle including the propagation of slow slip fronts and their interaction with strong/unstable asperities. These mechanisms may transform models of the way earthquakes initiate and better inform the interpretation of precursory activity. This project employs meter-scale laboratory experiments, where heterogeneous fault properties are imposed at specific locations and the effects on earthquake nucleation and triggering by slow slip fronts are studied in detail. Additionally, theoretical and numerical models for slow slip propagation on heterogeneous faults are developed to extend the laboratory results to length scales and conditions more relevant to natural earthquakes. The models are then tested against a field-scale glacial stick-slip cycle at Whillans Ice Stream, an Antarctic glacier, where aseismic transients affect 100 km-scale glacial stick-slip events and exhibit behavior similar to that observed in the lab.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
