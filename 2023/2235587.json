 "awd_abstract_narration": "Powder metallurgy is a topic with applications in literally every portion of the manufacturing sector in the US economy, and therefore, directly impacts economic welfare and national security. This award supports student participations for the International Conference on Powder Metallurgy and Particulate Materials (PowderMet2023) and co-located Additive Manufacturing with Powder Metallurgy (AMPM2023) conference, to be held 18-21 June 2023, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The support provides a new generation of student researchers with an opportunity to attend the advanced manufacturing conferences, present their work, learn from leading experts in the field, and interact with students from other institutions, fostering a sense of worldwide community of scientific enquiry. The supported students will present their posters and participate in the conference poster award competition, among other activities. The relationships with conference participants will help the students in determining their specific areas of interest in this broad field and create colleagues for future interactions and potential collaboration. This will not only stimulate learning and training for the students, but also allow them to be exposed to new research concepts in powder metallurgy and additive manufacturing. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the student participation in PowderMet2023 and AMPM2023 are to (1) expand career-enhancing learning opportunities for a broader knowledge of powder metallurgy and metal additive manufacturing, (2) promote technology transfer and provide a forum to introduce new research and development activities, (3) promote collaborative partnerships between organizations in advanced manufacturing and in emerging technologies to increase workforce development, and (4) develop a workforce aligned with regional economies based on emerging technologies across the Nation. The conference organizers will support up to 40 successful student applicants, who study at U.S. institutions. An emphasis will be placed on students whose institutions are under-resourced and would otherwise not be able to send them to the conference, and students presenting their research results at the conference. The organizers will invite applications through conference announcements and other means. The awards will provide support toward registration and accommodation. The availability of this support will encourage the participation of members of groups underrepresented in powder metallurgy research, and graduate and undergraduate students who are otherwise unable to afford attending these highly specialized advanced manufacturing conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
