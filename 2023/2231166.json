 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, allowing the institution's faculty and administrators to design and develop a comprehensive plan for improving and expanding STEM instruction. \r\n\r\nLittle Priest Tribal College (LPTC) serves the Winnebago Tribe  in Nebraska. The project leaders are conducting a cohesive set of activities that inform the design of a cyberinfrastructure upgrade, with the ultimate goal of completely upgrading the college\u2019s cybersecurity profile. The project will entail the key activities of: assessing the current cybersecurity profile; identifying potential vulnerabilities; consultation with experts who are conversant with the profiles at similarly situated TCUs; and determining specific actions and equipment necessary to rebuff hackers and avoid data failures. At the end of the planning period, LPTC should have a concrete plan upon which to develop a stronger cybersecurity network that will serve the college\u2019s advancing STEM instructional and research capacity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
