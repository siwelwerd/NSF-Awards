 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the diagnosis of residual cancer cells, after treatment of cancer patients. The test will be conducted early and accurately using a simple blood draw. Twenty percent of cancer patients will experience cancer recurrence. Unfortunately, cancer recurrence is not diagnosed until years after initial treatment when the cancer has often metastasized, resulting in poor patient outcomes. As a result, 7% of cancer patients suffer from debilitating fear of cancer recurrence. Early and accurate diagnosing of residual cancer cells will improve the outcome for the 20% of cancer patients who experience recurrence.  Additionally, it will help the 7% of cancer patients who suffer from debilitating fear of cancer recurrence. Overall, the costs of treating cancer will be lowered by diagnosing cancer earlier.\r\n\t\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a highly accurate diagnostic test for residual cancer from a blood draw. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) from cancer cells circulates through the blood stream. This cancer can be detected because of mutations in the DNA of cancer cells. However, cancer DNA is rare compared to normal DNA, which makes diagnosing cancer from a blood draw difficult. Proof-of-concept data has shown that accuracy can be greatly improved through the enrichment of cancer DNA from a sample. After the sample is collected, the DNA goes through rounds of duplication, except a blocker is added to prevent normal DNA from duplicating. Through this process the cancer DNA becomes a larger percentage of the overall DNA in the sample and can be more accurately detected. This project will develop a collection of tests for accurately diagnosing residual colorectal cancer. The key tasks of this project are: 1) demonstrate the clinical robustness of the optimized test method, 2) develop additional tests to cover most colorectal cancers, and 3) demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of the test methods. This project will lead to earlier and more accurately diagnosed cancer recurrence.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project funding led to new approaches for blocking normal DNA and improving quality control. These improvements allow the method use Sanger sequencing, which is very low cost. The concept shown in Figure 1, was realized with actual results in Figure 2. Multiple independent samples were run with either 100% normal DNA or 0.0125% cancer DNA. The 100% normal DNA is in blue, and is clustered near the bottom. This represents the background/noise of sequencing. The 0.0125% cancer DNA (~1.8 copies) samples were either called positive (orange) or called negative (green). The key here is that at ~1.8 copies, some samples would contain 0 cancer DNA copies based on Poisson distribution. The green dots (those predicted to have 0 copies of cancer DNA), cluster with the blue dots (100% normal DNA). The orange dots (those predicted to have 1, 2 or 3 copies of cancer DNA) cluster far away from the blue and green dots. The large separation provides high statistical confidence is being able to determine if the sample has 0 copies of cancer DNA or 1 copy of cancer DNA. &nbsp;Overall, these results suggest that this method is able to eliminate sequencing as a source of error. This is suggestive that the method could provide a significant advancement over current technologies for accurately diagnosing cancer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/17/2024<br>\nModified by: Matthew&nbsp;Nelson</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2321908/2321908_10881110_1729139549462_Figure_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2321908/2321908_10881110_1729139549462_Figure_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Sanger Sequencing Results\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2321908/2321908_10881110_1729139549462_Figure_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Sanger Sequencing Results\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2: Sanger Sequencing traces at mutant location for target mutation.
