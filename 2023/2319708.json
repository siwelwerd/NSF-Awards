 "awd_abstract_narration": "X-ray machines have found extensive applications in various fields, including medicine, engineering, agriculture, and dentistry. They are utilized to capture high-quality images of small components such as teeth, bones, and semiconductor chips for detailed analysis. However, the current X-ray machines often produce images with significant noise and poor resolution when dealing with intricately shaped parts. Consequently, comprehending the issues and identifying potential solutions becomes exceedingly challenging. The objective of this project is to acquire an advanced system that addresses these limitations. The Novel Performance-Driven 3D Imaging System for Extremely Noisy Objects  (NPIX) system will possess enhanced capabilities to capture images of the objects with complex geometries with minimal noise. \r\n\r\nThe NPIX system offers numerous advanced capabilities surpassing conventional tomography and laminography. NPIX significantly reduces the required training dataset size to merely tens or hundreds of images, as opposed to millions, for automated image analysis in various research areas. The resulting low noise images enhance state-of-the-art AI and deep learning algorithms, elevating conventional X-ray imaging to new heights. As a result, this system becomes a valuable tool for a diverse array of research and industrial applications.\r\n\r\nThe NPIX system is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, ideal for educational and training purposes. The project aims to utilize the system in multiple ways: 1) offering access to both on campus and off campus students nationally; 2) integrating X-ray expertise into K-12 education through the student science training program (SSTP); 3) partnering with research education for undergraduates (REU) and scholarship for service (SFS) programs, Neocity academy to expose undergraduate students to X-ray techniques; 4) providing continued education options for practical training; 5) involving undergraduate and underrepresented students in research; 6) collaborating with minority-serving institutions; 7) showcasing the system to visitors from local schools, community colleges and universities to inspire future leaders.\r\n\r\nThe project will involve collecting a large amount of X-ray images from the NPIX system in different fields. These resources can be accessed at  https://paine-conference.org/resources/. These shared resources can engage the community in different areas and help automating and enhancing inspection and assurance processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
