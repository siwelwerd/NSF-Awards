 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps is the development of a medical device for airway clearance to be used by civilian and military first-responders.  The proposed technology is a portable suction device.  Airway management is critically important in trauma patients, and airway compromise is the second leading cause of potentially survivable death on the battlefield. Effective portable suction is a key component of airway clearance for first responders; however, currently available devices are either too heavy and bulky to be carried (e.g., electrical units) or insufficiently powered (e.g., manually powered) to be useful. Many combat medics and civilian first responders decide against carrying suction units due to their poor efficacy and cannot justify the weight and space in their kits. Currently, none of the available products meet the functional needs of combat medics caring for massively injured casualties, and none have a robust design and logistical considerations needed by a mobile and agile military force. In addition, airway clearance may have important applicability in civilian emergency departments and intensive care units.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a medical device for airway clearance. The proposed battlefield-ready suction kit is designed for combat casualty care providers or their civilian counterparts.  The proposed technology is based on innovations in the interior flow loop that reduce resistance to flow, enabling higher suction pressures and evacuation flowrates. In addition, the device is designed to be capable of operating in any physical orientation during usage.  The proposed interior flow loop also may permit a lighter, more compact design, reducing the size and weight as compared with current electrically powered portable suction units on the market, which represents a critical improvement for a portable device.  A prototype has been developed and results demonstrate the proposed airway management device may have applicability in trauma patients in emergency departments and intensive care units.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over the course of our I-CORPS program, we conducted more than 125 interviews with a wide range of stakeholders, including potential customers, manufacturers, purchasing managers, decision-makers, and competitors.

We aimed to address the shortcomings of existing devices, which are often criticized for being too heavy if electrically powered or ineffective if manually powered. Our interviews revealed that many first responders do not carry portable suction devices because of these limitations. Additionally, we found that manufacturers&rsquo; specifications for these devices are sometimes misleading or incorrect. As a result, first responders are often forced to use less effective methods to manage airways, such as placing trauma victims in the recovery position, which can be dangerous for patients with spinal injuries. One first responder captured the gravity of this issue by saying, &ldquo;In the field, we say that it's better for a patient to be paralyzed for life rather than dead.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In addition to guiding our product development, the insights we gathered were disseminated at local, national, and international conferences. These included the Biomedical Engineering Society Annual Conference, the Military Health System Research Symposium, and the San Antonio Military Health and Universities Research Forum. Presenting our findings at these events allowed us to share our knowledge with a broader audience and gather further feedback to improve our work.</p>\n<p>We also have two academic journal articles currently under review based on our findings. These papers will not only detail the comparative assessments of current portable suction technology but also discuss relevant ISO standards and provide recommendations for improving emergency intervention tools used by different branches of the U.S. military. By integrating the data from our customer interviews, we hope to influence both the development of new technologies and the formulation of policies and standards that govern their use.</p>\n<p>Our engagement with the I-CORPS program has had a lasting impact on our team and our broader professional communities. The training we received improved our interviewing techniques and enhanced our ability to communicate complex technical information in a clear and professional manner. These skills have been shared with colleagues through teaching and mentorship. For example, the Principal Investigator (PI) of our team incorporated I-CORPS customer discovery principles into his Medical Device Design and Commercialization course and advocated for their adoption in Senior Design coursework within his department. This initiative led to other faculty members from his institution, such as Adel Alaeddini, leading their own teams through the I-CORPS training process.</p>\n<p>The I-CORPS training also influenced ethical discussions within the Biomedical Engineering Society, where the PI contributed to the Sub-Committee on Ethics. Based on insights gained from the I-CORPS approach, a session was organized at the society&rsquo;s annual meeting to address ethical issues faced by international students and faculty working in the United States. This panel discussion provided a platform for students and faculty at various career stages to share their experiences and engage with the broader community on these important topics.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the results from our interviews have started to shape military procurement strategies. Discussions with groups like the U.S. Special Operations Command highlighted a critical gap in portable medical suction capabilities. This increased awareness has already begun to influence the types of technologies being sought in military funding announcements, demonstrating the practical impact of our research.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, our work has combined rigorous market research, hands-on product development, and educational outreach to advance the field of portable medical suction technology. By listening to the needs of first responders and other stakeholders, we have not only guided the design of a more effective device but also contributed to broader discussions about medical ethics, training, and policy. As we prepare to publish our findings, we remain committed to improving emergency care for both civilian and military populations, ensuring that first responders have the tools they need to save lives in the most challenging situations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 08/26/2024<br>\nModified by: Robert&nbsp;L&nbsp;Hood</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2245173/2245173_10838515_1724719862718_Overview_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2245173/2245173_10838515_1724719862718_Overview_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ecosystem Overview\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2245173/2245173_10838515_1724719862718_Overview_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ecosystem Overview\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ecosystem of Standards.
