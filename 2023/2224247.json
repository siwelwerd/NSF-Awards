 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics learning in early childhood lays a foundation for ongoing engagement with math and STEM, supports development across a variety of other domains like reading, and is an important predictor of long-term academic achievement. Given the importance of early math, researchers and educators have created a variety of classroom-focused resources to support mathematical learning, thinking, and skill development. However, many of these resources do not take into account the important roles that parents, and the home learning environment play in supporting math learning and engagement. Current efforts also do not go far enough in countering deficit perspectives on families and moving beyond engagement strategies and activity structures based primarily on cultural models of learning from White, monolingual, middle- and upper-class communities. To achieve a new vision of equitable math learning in early childhood, it is important to disrupt power hierarchies between minoritized families and schools and reposition parents as central to children\u2019s mathematics learning. Educators and researchers must also reconceptualize traditional ideas about math that are rooted in histories of marginalization and discrimination.\r\n\r\nTo advance approaches for addressing these systemic barriers, the project, Viviendo Matematicas, will conduct an equity-informed design-based implementation research (DBIR) study with the goal of developing a potentially transformative model for collaborating with Latinx families and early childhood educators to shape a more equitable vision of mathematics education in the preschool years.  Partnering with Head Start educators in Portland, OR, and New York, NY and Latinx parents with preschool-age children (3\u20135 years) who are Head Start eligible based on the  household's lower income, the project will extend prior equity work by using dialogic and asset-based approaches to amplify existing math knowledge and practices within families, broaden our collective understanding and appreciation of mathematics inside and outside the classroom, and identify design principles for parent educator collaborations that can be shared with other communities. Through the iterative, community-based design process, the project will deliver: (a) a strength-based framework describing Latinx early childhood math practices, (b) a program model and associated resources for supporting parent-educator math dialogue groups, and (c) design principles and theoretical frameworks underlying the dialogue program and how it supports a more equitable vision of math learning. By reorganizing traditional relationships between parents and school, the project seeks to empower Latinx parents and families as equal partners and advocates for their children\u2019s education, as well as support the creation of sustainable resources for Head Start programs in our communities that align with families\u2019 goals and values.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project is funded through the Racial Equity in STEM Education program (EDU Racial Equity). The program supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce. Awarded projects seek to center the voices, knowledge, and experiences of the individuals, communities, and institutions most impacted by systemic inequities within the STEM enterprise. This program aligns with NSF\u2019s core value of supporting outstanding researchers and innovative thinkers from across the Nation's diversity of demographic groups, regions, and types of organizations. Programs across EDU contribute funds to the Racial Equity program in recognition of the alignment of its projects with the collective research and development thrusts of the four divisions of the directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
