 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel medical device for intramuscular injections that will reduce needlestick injury. Unintended or accidental puncture is the second most common occupational hazard for healthcare staff. An estimated 385,000 needlestick injuries occur in the United States each year impacting 5.6 million healthcare workers. Needlestick injury represents one of the largest risks, both financially ($258 million annually) and medically (e.g., bloodborne pathogen exposure), to healthcare providers. This project aims to develop a novel, flexible hypodermic needle with a safety syringe that enables rapid injections while replacing sharp needles and significantly reducing risks of unintended health care provider injury.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project provides a novel, flexible, polymer needle-based safety syringe for health care providers to perform intramuscular injections in patients. A novel and variable stiffness shaft is integrated with an external safety lumen mechanism to create an integrated delivery system with the same delivery reliability and repeatability as standard needlesticks. The design will be prototyped and evaluated under a variety of human factors considerations. The device will be required to pass several mechanical tests for puncture, insertion, and lumen integrity in a consistent manner, as anticipated during routine clinical use.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nProject Outcomes Report - SBIR Phase I\r\n\n\nAward ID: 2219892\r\n\n\nSafety Syringe Needle for Prevention of Unintended/Accidental Puncture (Needlestick Injury)\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe goal of this work is to develop a hypodermic needle that is intrinsically safe and thus a needle that prevents accidental puncture, often referred to as needlestick injury. Needlestick injuries, the wounds caused by sharp objects accidentally puncturing or scratching the skin, are a major risk for healthcare workers and can be costly financially and medically. A distinguishing additional feature of this new technology is the solution should be cost competitive with conventional needles and therefore significantly expand common usage beyond existing passive safety needle systems currently available.\r\n\n\nDuring the course of this project, a needle concept was developed and tested against conventional needles using standard methods outlined in ISO-7864 and typically required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before sale in the United States. Thirty samples, each tested six times, of the newly developed needle successfully punctured test media 100% of time to 80% of the working needle depth. Also, the peak puncture force was similar to the force for a comparative conventional needle. Similarly, flow testing of 30 samples, each tested three times, flowed 36% better, on average, compared with similar testing of conventional needles.\r\n\n\nInitially, the improved flow was not believed to be an important development. Upon further investigation, for some high viscosity (thickness) drugs, hormonals, biologics and monoclonal antibodies, improved flow is actually a very significant feature. For example, Faslodex, a hormonal treatment for breast cancer, typically requires two large intramuscular injections in the buttock that each take two minutes to inject. Decreasing the size of the needle, which reduces pain, and increasing the flow rate could significantly improve the patient experience.\r\n\n\nThere is an opportunity for our hypodermic needle replacement to not only address needlestick injuries but improve the patient experience by reducing needle size and/or reducing required injection time. As a conventional needle replacement, for many common injections, needlestick injury would be eliminated. As a conventional needle replacement on a pre-filled syringe with a high viscosity drug, there would be improved patient experience with reduced injection pain and time.\r\n\n\nAs a needle replacement with an autoinjector system, high viscosity or high-volume drugs that cannot currently be injected because of the required high injection force or time limitations, could now be an option. There are various types of autoinjectors but the purpose often is to allow a person to self-administer the injection using a push button system that performs all or part of the required insertion, injection and withdrawal.\r\n\n\nThere is an effort throughout the healthcare community to find ways to reduce cost in the system. One effort is to move provided healthcare out of the hospital environment to a clinic environment. Additionally, more healthcare is now being migrated out of the clinic environment to the home environment. Pre-filled autoinjectors are also becoming more ubiquitous now. An autoinjector that is safer and less prone to cause needlestick injuries and additionally also flow better, has potential to make significant impact in this expanding environment.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/17/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: StevenWOpolski\n"
