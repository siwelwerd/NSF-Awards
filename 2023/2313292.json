 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Polymath Jr is an online program that provides hundreds of college students the opportunity to participate in mathematical research. This highly inclusive program allows each participant to choose how much they want to get out of the program by selecting how much time they want to dedicate. The program presents a variety of research projects in many branches of mathematics. Each project is mentored by a professor and graduate students. The program supports students who might otherwise have no opportunity to explore their mathematical potential. The participants learn how mathematical research is conducted, and many participants also publish papers in research journals. The program helps participants explore various other engagement opportunities in mathematical research.\r\n\r\nThe 2023 Polymath Jr program will include research projects in number theory, combinatorics, topology, algebra, probability, complex analysis, machine learning, math education, and more. We focus on problems that consist of separate parts at different levels of difficulty. The staggered projects allow supporting groups of students with varied mathematical backgrounds. The program also includes a component for training graduate students to mentor undergraduate research projects and run research groups.\r\n\r\nProgram website is at https://geometrynyc.wixsite.com/polymathreu\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
