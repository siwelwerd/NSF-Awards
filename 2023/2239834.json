 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the face of climate change, one target is to transition combustion-powered sectors (such as internal combustion vehicles) into technologies powered by electricity. The strategy is that the electric grid \u2013 currently comprised of a mix of combustion, renewable, and nuclear generation units \u2013 will become cleaner and greener over time. Studies indicate that electrification will reduce greenhouse gas emissions regardless of the grid\u2019s composition, however related air quality benefits remain poorly understood, particularly at impact- and equity-relevant neighborhood-scales. This project will develop and validate a fine-scale (~1 km) climate and air quality analysis framework that can assess the co-benefits and tradeoffs of electrified transportation options at neighborhood scales. The project will (i) create emission scenarios that account for increased grid demand and uncertainties in grid evolution, (ii) simulate the interaction of meteorological and chemical processes, (iii) characterize changes in GHGs and air pollutants, (iv) assess economic, social, and public health implications at equity-relevant neighborhood-scales, and (v) educate and inspire the next-generation of scientists and students with climate solution-focused curriculum development and mentorship opportunities. Research themes, methods, and products will be integrated into middle school curriculum via co-development of Next Generation Science Standards content and shared in an after-school mentorship programs serving under-represented student populations. \r\n\r\nThe project will combine a fine-scale climate and chemical transport model along with air quality sensor monitoring data and a regulatory-grade modeling framework (WRF- CMAQ-SMOKE-MOVES) to bring focus to electric vehicle (EV) impacts at equity-relevant scales. Neighborhood-scale simulations are critical because air pollution and remediation efforts often have local impacts and effects \u2013 features vital for engendering support of policy makers and environmental justice supporters. Additionally, public discussions of climate solutions have traditionally been framed around their carbon emission reduction potential. However, benefits from concomitant reductions in air pollutants may exceed GHG abatement costs. Economic, social, and public health analyses of emergent technologies, if co-beneficial, could provide the impetus for consumer purchases and/or development of adoption incentive policies. Educational objectives of the project seek to simultaneously address multiple related challenges within the Earth & Environmental sciences, including the limited Earth & Environmental science content in school curricula and the lack of diversity in these fields. By partnering with a Northwestern University outreach organization to develop sustainability-based content as part of the on-going implementation of Next Generation Science Standards, the investigator will introduce the project's research to a diverse population of students and help to bridge in-school and out-of-school STEM-focused educational activities while facilitating potentially transformative learning experiences. Meaningful and sustained contact with these students is intended to promote their college readiness and STEM interest, as well as provide teaching and outreach opportunities for the investigator's trainees.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
