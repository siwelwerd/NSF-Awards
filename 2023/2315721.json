It increased awareness of activities underway in Europe and perspectives among public and private funding organizations. Research outputs documented an archival snapshot of the state of publicly usage and impact data exchange and analytics.\n\n\nFour key areas for action were identified that will strengthen infrastructure for impact metrics for publicly accessible scholarship: 1) engaging further stakeholders working with other output types and internationally, 2) piloting a Minimum Viable Product for a usage data trust, 3) understanding and committing to shared values and principles and 4) addressing and clarifying usage data ownership.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/28/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CharlesWatkinson\n"
