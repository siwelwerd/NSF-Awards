 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Summary\r\n\r\nThe 2023 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Nanoporous Materials and Their Applications: Expanding the Horizons of Porous Materials Design and Applications, and the associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS): Leveraging Order and Disorder in Nanoporous Materials are being held at Proctor Academy (Andover, New Hampshire) from August 2-8, 2023. The combined GRC/GRS will support registration expenses for approximately 26 student and postdoc attendees from U.S. institutions to focus on new developments in the field of nanoporous materials, including novel materials and their potential application to a wide range of commercial technologies in areas as diverse as chemical manufacturing, petroleum and natural gas refining, electronic materials, and medical applications. Student and postdoc participants will also benefit from interactions with senior leaders in the field and related networking activities designed to highlight career opportunities related to nanoporous material technologies.  NSF's Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research supports stipends for registration fee and/or travel support for some early-career participants at this conference because of its relevance to their respective programmatic scope.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary\r\n\r\nThe Nanoporous Materials and Their Applications GRC/GRS will focus on new developments in the field of nanoporous materials. Porous materials, such as zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, covalent-organic frameworks, porous carbon, and related materials, are heavily utilized in today\u2019s most dynamic and diversified research fields. The conference, with support from NSF's Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, addresses important new findings related to the invention of novel materials, characterization of their unique properties, and the use of these materials in emerging applications involving catalysis, separations, gas storage, and other processes of commercial and environmental importance. The program addresses these topics through invited lectures, poster presentations, and general discussion focused on linking fundamental understanding to potential applications. Emphasis will be placed on intermingling different classes of nanoporous materials. The program also balances theoretical and experimental approaches to addressing questions related to structure and applicability. Beyond the technological aspects, the conference seeks to gather leading and emerging scientists in this field and bring them together to share ideas and foster new collaborations. With respect to this larger goal, the GRC seeks to provide a common language for our diverse student body; to raise the comfort-level of our student/postdoc participants; and, through these efforts, to develop a tightly-woven community held together by a common interest in nanoporous materials. The accompanying GRS that is dedicated to and organized by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will aid in the active participation of this new generation of scientists. The collegial, retreat-like atmosphere of the conference, with exciting invited lectures, which are complemented by lively poster sessions, as well as communal dinners, opportunities for informal gatherings, and mentoring panels, provides a venue for scientists from different disciplines to brainstorm together and promotes cross-disciplinary collaborations in the various research areas represented. Additional efforts have been made by the organizers to encourage the participation of underrepresented minorities and women. At this meeting, 32% of the invited speakers and discussion leaders are women. In addition, an informal power hour focusing on the career development of women in science will be included.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
