 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Systems of PDEs in Fluid Mechanics and Atmospheric Sciences\" will take place at West Virginia University, in Morgantown, WV, from September 15 to 17, 2023. This award provides funding for a conference to bring together experts, early researchers, and students, to share and exchange the latest advances in the study of systems of conservation laws and related applications. The event will include support for two mini-courses, nine invited talks from guest speakers and fourteen contributed talks from graduate students and postdocs. \r\n\r\nThe main theme of this conference is the study of non-smooth solutions of a wide variety of partial differential equations arising in fluid dynamics, atmosphere and ocean science and other fields. These solutions may have singularities corresponding to different physical phenomena. The event will offer two mini-courses reviewing the theory of systems of conservation laws and optimal transport, and invited talks on topics including conservation laws with general fluxes, water waves and non-local conservation laws, adhesion dynamics and presureless gas systems, and semi-geostrophic equations and optimal transport. Additional information will be uploaded in the conference website: https://math.wvu.edu/~adtudorascu/fluids-conf-wvu2023.htm\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
