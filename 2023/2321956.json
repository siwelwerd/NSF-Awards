 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in exposing students to cultures other than their own to foster empathy, not only for others, but to better understand themselves and their own culture. The 21st century workforce requires multilingual, curious, collaborative, empathetic learners. Yet, immersive opportunities to exercise empathy cross-culturally are difficult to access and empathy requires practice. Geographic and cultural knowledge from travel abroad programs is proven to increase empathy, but such experiences serve relatively few students. Schools need a cost-effective and safe way of equitably delivering immersive cross-cultural engagement to meet increasingly global demands. This project intends to present the international film festival as a rich learning atmosphere, replicable at scale to serve learners well beyond the traditional audience diversity and number. The immersive experience will be delivered to respond to learning needs in the classrooms, after-school programs, hospitals, and refugee centers.  The films will be expertly curated, globally streamed, co-viewed across time zones, and enhanced with moderated curriculum. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project replicates and magnifies aspects of the film festival model which correspond to social impact business innovation, specifically, empathy. Multiple identified paths to empathy in each session are activated and reproduced through discussion, analysis, gamification and assessment. This series of assessments engages the learner to better understand how they learn, while reinforcing the memory of learning of a culture outside of their own as integral to their developing worldview.  The project also establishes a foundation for both media and cultural literacy. The platform will activate non-generative artificial intelligence (AI) in service of matching profiles, scheduling, automation, assessment tabulation and reporting, and archiving. The technology will employ generative AI with AR (augmented reality) in service of translation in post-film discussion as well as location-based information to enable additional points of empathy for discussion.  With respect to assessments, AI will be used to provide feedback to participants, impacting learning episode memory.  The assessments will also serve in the facilitation of qualitative assessments so that participants receive timely reports, illuminating similarities and differences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This reinforces the primary goal of our Phase 1 NSF project: To expand Screen360.tv&rsquo;s reach to 6-12th grade learners through our Berlin Film Festival-inspired learning system.

Our ability to evaluate Screen360.tv&rsquo;s specific objective of increasing students&rsquo; cultural competence showed up in the reactions to the international film as well as the diverse audience, though all US citizens. We were able to expose 23 students (43% of the 54 students who viewed at least 1 film with Screen360.tv) to their first foreign film, able to bring two U.S. based classrooms from different states to co-view an international film and witness empathy in physical responses (smiling in recognition, nodding) and conversations building in the chat. One class of students viewed 5 different foreign films over a period of 4 months, both with and without domestic co-viewing, providing us with a case study of how Screen360.tv could influence students who are given multiple exposures to the Screen360.tv experience. <strong>The study results showed nearly 30% increase in cultural interest and 10% increase in empathy, surpassing the comparison group (Fig. 1, below).</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Collaboration with development firm Cognativ helped us build a platform that easily facilitates the co-viewing of international films amongst middle and high school classes, globally. This is essential for Screen360.tv&rsquo;s vision of providing cross-cultural immersion through international film festival experiences for those young people who are unable to access immersive cross-cultural experiences or attend such a festival in person. We believe such a simulation will, in the short term, increase student cultural competencies in the specific areas of empathy towards, interest in, and respect for other cultures. In the long term, we connect these dispositions to an increase in multilingual, curious, empathetic, innovative individuals who can thrive in a global economy.

We employed the Program for International Assessment Global Competence Assessment (PISA GCA) along with the platform&rsquo;s activities and assessments. Qualitative interviews conducted with four participating students further validated these impressive results. Students expressed that Screen360.tv inspired interest in travel and learning another language, with qualitative statements such as, &ldquo;<em>...I just feel like I&rsquo;m gonna go explore more stuff </em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>I never wanted to travel as much as I did like after watching the films....the films made it feel worthwhile.</em>&rdquo; Students also expressed how Screen360.tv showed them &ldquo;<em>...what may be normal</em>&rdquo; in other cultures and how to &ldquo;<em>...fit in in a different place and adjust my standards.</em>&rdquo;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Fig.<span>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Pre and Post comparison of Screen360.tv students to PISA OECD students on two PISA questions asking about Q1 interest in cultures of the world and Q2 religions of the world.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Beat the Odds Bootcamp, Commercialization coaching, the intensive iCorps and over 100 industry interviews directed us toward a segment of students and their teachers that ensures a well-aligned, initial beachhead market.
