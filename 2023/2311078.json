 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer algorithms have been used to automatically generate and optimize designs for everything from aircraft wing structures to cardiovascular stents.  However, these algorithms are typically limited to the design of single-body structures, with all motion occurring by means of structural deformation.  This limits the complexity of the designs that can be synthesized, preventing the design of multi-body systems containing several moving parts.  This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will advance the science of automated computational design by creating new algorithms capable of generating and optimizing multi-body systems.  Starting with only a mathematical description of design materials and physical environment, the algorithms will automatically generate assemblies for compound machines that combine multiple basic components such as levers, hinges, wheels, and axles, which together form the foundation of all mechanical design. This work will enable a new level of automated computational design not previously possible under existing design frameworks.  The knowledge obtained from this research will benefit a wide range of applications including nanoscale mechanisms for delivery of medications and self-reproducing robotic systems. The project also involves an integrated education program featuring a STEM Pipeline program for undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups. The program includes bi-weekly labs and seminars, team design projects, and K-12 outreach activities. \r\n\r\nThe algorithms created in this project will rely upon several novel design formulations devised specifically for the design task.  Chief among these will be an original topology optimization-type framework in which the internal topologies of multiple planar design domains are optimized simultaneously, while also optimizing the connectivity between adjacent domains to form compound mechanisms whose components can slide and rotate freely with respect to one another.  The mechanical behavior of the designs will be modeled using a combination of finite element analysis and flexible multibody dynamics to capture the rigid body motion and the elastic deflection of the system components.  Additionally, adjoint sensitivity analysis will be used to derive and compute the design sensitivities that will power the gradient-based optimization algorithms.  The new design framework will be validated via high-fidelity computational simulations, as well as through fabrication and experimental testing.  This testing will be used to quantify the efficiency of the generated designs, as determined by their mechanical and geometric advantage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The algorithms are based on a method known as <em>topology optimization</em>, in which the algorithm is given only a mathematical description of the task that the designed structure must perform along with information about the mechanical behavior of the design materials. From this limited information, the algorithm independently generates the optimal geometry and material layout of the structure. Prior to this project, these algorithms were largely limited to designing monolithic structures containing a single part. One of the main goals of this effort was to extend the capability of the method to be able to produce multi-body mechanical assemblies, thereby drastically expanding the capabilities of the method.</p>\r\n<p>In pursuit of this goal, we developed original mathematical formulations that enabled the algorithm to simultaneously optimize both the boundary conditions and the internal material layout of the structure. Boundary conditions contain crucial information about the structure, such as the location and direction of the applied loads, as well as the positioning of the clamps that hold the structure in place. Whereas earlier topology optimization methods treated the boundary conditions as fixed features that could not be modified, our innovations allowed the optimizer to determine where and how the loads and clamps should be applied in order to improve performance. With this new capability, we achieved significant performance gains. In one example, we generated a mechanical inverter that exhibited a 123% increase in performance when compared with similar mechanisms that were designed with fixed boundary conditions.</p>\r\n<p>Another major thrust within this project was the design of wheeled vehicles. Wheeled systems represent the pinnacle of mechanical design, and they are emblematic of the type of synergy that can be achieved in a well-designed multi-part system. For this reason, we sought to create an algorithm that could autonomously synthesize wheeled vehicles, and essentially <em>re-invent </em>the wheel using only rudimentary knowledge of mechanical principles. We developed an original algorithm that could create wheelbarrow-style vehicles for both flat and bumpy terrain. Starting from a simple black box, the algorithm deduced the optimal outer shape of the wheel along the internal structural layout (i.e. the spoke configuration) and the axle location, where the wheel connects to the cart. To the best of our knowledge, this result was the first of its kind as no previous algorithm had autonomously synthesized a wheeled vehicle system.</p>\r\n<p>In the final stage of the project, we extended our investigation of wheeled systems to explore how we could use computational design techniques as a forensic tool to gain insight into how wheels evolved back when they were originally invented nearly 6000 years ago. Based on information from the published literature and the archaeological record, we hypothesized that the wheel originally evolved from simple rollers, and we created a new algorithm that simulated the progression from a roller to a wheel-and-axle structure. Through our analysis, we identified three key innovations that likely led to the creation of the first wheels, and our results provide corroborating evidence for an emerging theory that the wheel was originally invented by copper miners operating in the Carpathian Mountains around 3900BC. Lastly, we demonstrated how the evolution of the wheel was facilitated by the unique features of the mine environment, which exerted selective pressures in a manner analogous to way in which selective environmental pressures drive biological evolution.</p>\r\n<p>For the E<em>ducation and Outreach</em> component of the project, we created a seminar series called &ldquo;Routes to STEM&rdquo;, which featured technical talks from a diverse group of engineering professors. In addition to discussing their research, speakers were encouraged to discuss their personal career journey and identify the factors and pivotal moments that influenced their career paths. Attendees to the seminars were asked to fill out questionnaires that solicited survey data on their experiences in STEM. Using this data, we performed a qualitative analysis to identify what factors contribute to the lack of minorities and women in STEM fields. Our analysis indicatedthat it may be possible to improve engagement and participation among women and minorities by emphasizing the collaborative and communal aspects of STEM, and by highlighting its potential for social impact.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/31/2025<br>\nModified by: Kai&nbsp;A&nbsp;James</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2311078/2311078_10533950_1738335814690_Inverter--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2311078/2311078_10533950_1738335814690_Inverter--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Force Inverter\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2311078/2311078_10533950_1738335814690_Inverter--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Force Inverter\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">3D-printed prototype of a computationally designed force inverter</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lee Alacoque</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kai&nbsp;A&nbsp;James\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Force Inverter</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2311078/2311078_10533950_1738357685391_WheelsetStressField--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2311078/2311078_10533950_1738357685391_WheelsetStressField--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Stress analysis of a wheel-and-axle structure\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2311078/2311078_10533950_1738357685391_WheelsetStressField--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Stress analysis of a wheel-and-axle structure\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Computer simulation of the stress distribution within a computationally designed wheel-and-axle structure under normal operating loads.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lee Alacoque</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kai&nbsp;A&nbsp;James\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Stress analysis of a wheel-and-axle structure</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2311078/2311078_10533950_1738350074217_WheelsetEvolution--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2311078/2311078_10533950_1738350074217_WheelsetEvolution--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Evolution of the Wheel & Axle\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2311078/2311078_10533950_1738350074217_WheelsetEvolution--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Evolution of the Wheel & Axle\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This figure shows the evolution of a wheel-and-axle structure from a simple roller during the execution of the design algorithm.
