 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of technology for management of plant parasitic nematodes (PPN).  Using the proposed technology, nematicide may be applied at 1/100th or less its current commercial rate and provide significant reduction in nematode populations and a dramatic increase in crop yield.  In addition, it may be possible to deliver other crop production moieties in concert with nematicide, including fertilizer, biologicals, insecticides or fungicides. PPN infection of cash crops causes an excess of $125 billion in worldwide crop damage annually, and PPNs are regarded as the most damaging biotic crop stressor where there is no viable management option, straining global food security. PPN impact every crop plant in every agricultural setting and industry including smallholder and organic farming, forestry, field and truck crops, ornamentals, and turf. For some crops, such as soybean, nematodes are recognized as the major pest. For other crops, nematodes contribute significantly to a net reduction in yield. Achieving safe and effective nematode control is a key part of the movement toward environmentally sustainable agriculture.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a platform enabling a field deployable paper-like seed treatment (nematicide-treated banana paper) to combat plant parasitic nematodes (PPN).  Reducing PPN infection of crops will increase crop yield and quality and reduce soil populations of nematodes. The proposed technology combines the ancient art of papermaking with expertise in nematology and fibrous materials, enabling targeted delivery of beneficial small molecules during crop establishment. Incorporation of active ingredients into a lignocellulose matrix, such as banana paper, allows for effective distribution of crop protection agents without interfering with farming practices. The shelf-stable lightweight material may be applied at planting. The prototype under development is an \u201cactive\u201d paper sheet with perforated sections to simply wrap and protect the seed (piece). The localization of the active ingredient, either adsorbed directly or embedded in the paper, specifically targets PPN versus beneficial organisms. Nematodes are primarily a seedling disease, so root protection early is critical to the successful establishment of the crop. Early season control translates into reduced post-harvest losses for root and tuber crops as well. Results from multi-year on-farm trials indicate that the proposed technology protects tuber crops from significant infections that lead to both in-season and post-harvest losses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
