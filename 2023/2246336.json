 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed IRES program aims to provide U.S. undergraduate students with international research experience in preparing advanced energy storage and conversion materials in greenhouse gas reforming (carbon dioxide and methane) and high-efficient lithium-ion battery preparation. Four U.S. students per year for three years (12 students) from regional/national underrepresented groups will be mentored by counterpart faculties and graduate students with expertise in ongoing projects at the Qingdao campus of Shandong University of Science and Technology (SDUST), Shandong, China. These students will participate in research projects with the frontiers of knowledge and methodological approaches. IRES students will develop and polish valuable technical skills, learn about renewable, sustainable solutions to global greenhouse gas challenges, and live in a bicultural community of faculty and students participating in the program. It benefits the advancement of CO2 dry reforming CH4 (greenhouse gas reforming) and lithium-ion battery design and preparation in the U.S. The University of Texas Permian Basin (UTPB) is a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) located in rural West Texas, serving 37% of Pell-eligible and 49% of first-generation students whose families often work in the oil fields or service industries. The IRES participants will be recruited from underrepresented groups (i.e., women and minorities) in West Texas and Pell grant-qualified applicants in STEM nationally. The proposed project will further develop their interest in STEM and enhance their enthusiasm to pursue graduate studies and careers in STEM disciplines.  This IRES project, through interactions with global mentors and peers and working in international research environments, provides the students with opportunities to be prepared for worldwide competence and cooperation in addressing energy issues and climate change. \r\n\r\nClimate change due to greenhouse gas (carbon emission) brings with it a tremendous threat to humans. This IRES research project aims to develop new methodologies or improve existing ones to design and prepare energy storage/conversion advanced materials for carbon emission reduction to mitigate climate change damage. A computational model will be used for students to study reaction mechanisms. Students in the program will perform independent research projects that aim to achieve high-efficient energy utilization and enhance energy storage and conversion. They will engage in the following topics of CO2 dry reforming CH4 and lithium-ion batteries design: 1) preparation of bio-mass carbon-based catalyst and using it for CO2 dry reforming of CH4 with microwave plasma discharge; 2) investigation of the evolution of thermal stress process of the carbon structure and evaluating any potential damage to biomass-based carbon catalyst; 3) analysis of the data from the proposed experiments to disclose the reaction mechanism in combination with the results from quantum mechanics calculations;  4) prepare the Sb-based anode for high-performance testing in lithium-ion batteries; and 5) assemble lithium batteries and evaluate their performance. The breakthroughs made from the project can significantly impact the improvements of lithium-ion battery efficiency and greenhouse reforming, as well as in the U.S. corresponding areas. The proposed research projects will contribute to carbon emission reduction by achieving high-efficiency energy storage and conversion. Reutilization of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide plus methane from abundant, low-cost natural gas reserves can manufacture new chemical feedstocks to produce durable chemicals in a carbon-neutral or carbon-negative route.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
