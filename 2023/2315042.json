 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will work with artificial intelligence (AI) creators and Black girls, aged 9-14, to expand the range of perspectives and voices that are a part of AI technology. The project will include after school and summer camps for both Black girls and the AI creators to work together on the design and creation of AI projects.  \r\n\r\nThis project examines two research questions. One is theoretical: What are design principles for an intersectional AI learning ecosystem? With this question the PIs explore Black girls' experiences with AI learning ecosystems, and how they can enact the constructs of intersectionality (critical reflection, action, accountability). Findings related to question 1 will help them develop a framework for intersectional professional development for AI professionals that is specific to how racial equity can be realized in AI learning; and, help them create new curricula that integrates AI; and, develop a framework for how to integrate PD, with curricula and technologies in AI spaces in order to create a more cohesive learning ecosystem. Research question 2 focuses on implementation: What are practical implementation guidelines for community organizations to integrate curricula and professional development into an intersectional AI learning ecosystem? The findings from this question will facilitate the development of resources for AI educators and community organizations. The findings from this project will be of interest to technology educators, AI professionals, the broader STEM education field, and community organizations that provide STEM education.  \r\n\r\nThis project is funded through the Racial Equity in STEM Education activity (EDU Racial Equity). The activity supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce. Awarded projects seek to center the voices, knowledge, and experiences of the individuals, communities, and institutions most impacted by systemic inequities within the STEM enterprise. This activity aligns with NSF's core value of supporting outstanding researchers and innovative thinkers from across the Nation's diversity of demographic groups, regions, and types of organizations. Programs across EDU contribute funds to the Racial Equity activity in recognition of the alignment of its projects with the collective research and development thrusts of the four divisions of the directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
