 "awd_abstract_narration": "Subduction zone earthquakes can cause tsunamis, a deadly natural disaster. In the last two decades tsunamis generated near the land-ocean boundary have caused a quarter of a million fatalities (the 2004 Sumatra event, Earth\u2019s deadliest recent natural disaster) and losses more than $200 billion (Japan\u2019s 2011 event, one of the most expensive natural disasters in history). A similar event is likely to hit the US Oregon-Washington coast sometime in the future.  Unfortunately, the ability to forecast these catastrophic events is not very good. This project will deploy and test several types of instruments for measuring small motions of the seafloor that may be earthquake precursors. The results will be used to improve forecasts and understanding of subduction zone earthquakes and tsunamis. \r\n\r\nThe project will deploy new, cost-effective state-of the art sea floor geodesy equipment offshore Central America, in two transects sampling adjacent segments of the subduction zone. The two segments contrast in important geological and geophysical characteristics, providing a unique opportunity for hypothesis testing of the role of megathrust properties in tsunami generation. For example, is accumulation of shallow slip deficit in the near-trench region of subduction zones a necessary condition for a subduction-related tsunami? The question can be answered by comparing strain rate profiles in two adjacent offshore segments of the Central America subduction zone that contrast in earthquake characteristics, locking behavior, and tsunami history. The seismogenic zone offshore the Nicoya peninsula of Costa Rica has not produced a significant tsunami in recorded history despite frequent M 7.2 \u2013 7.8 earthquakes, while the one to the north offshore Nicaragua and El Salvador generated tsunamis in 1992 and 2012. Assuming slip deficit accumulation is a necessary condition for tsunamis, the project would expect to observe no slip deficit in the offshore region of northern Costa Rica but observe a shallow slip deficit (locking?) in southern Nicaragua, indicating the potential for another tsunami there in the next few decades. One subtlety is the possibility of stress shadow effects, whereby up-dip sections of the forearc are not frictionally \u2018locked\u2019 but rather \u2018ride along\u2019 with deeper locked asperities on the plate interface, accumulating a partial slip deficit despite being frictionally stable. The trench-perpendicular geodetic transects should allow assessment of this possibility.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
