 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hyper-Kamiokande is a particle physics detector that is constructed 600m underground in the Kamioka mine In Hida City, Japan. The detector consists of a 68m diameter and 71m high water tank surrounded by 20,000 50cm diameter photo-sensors which detect the light emissions of particles traversing the water. Its primary purpose is to study neutrinos, elementary particles without electric charge that interact only weakly with detector materials, thus requiring a large detector mass. Hyper-Kamiokande\u2019s mass of 260,000 metric tons makes it the largest detector of this type that has been built so far: the target mass available for neutrino measurement of Hyper-Kamiokande will be more than ten times the equivalent mass of Super-Kamiokande, its predecessor. Hyper-Kamiokande will observe neutrinos in a wide energy range from a variety of natural and man-made sources such as astrophysical neutrinos (e.g. from the sun or stellar explosions known as supernovae), atmospheric neutrinos, and in addition, neutrinos from a beam produced by a particle accelerator at a distance of 295km. Neutrinos are ideal messengers to understand astrophysical phenomena as they are not influenced by electromagnetic forces. Hyper-Kamiokande will therefore serve as an astrophysical neutrino observatory, but it will also study the nature of the neutrino particle itself and will search for the extremely rare decays of protons (or neutrons). This project is to focus upon the astrophysical neutrinos including those of lower energy that may result in new discoveries.  A large set of activities included within the participating universities focusing on students in K-12 and at the undergraduate level will provide these students with the opportunity to engage in a world class experiment involving a broad international collaboration.\r\n\r\nTo realize the astrophysical potential of Hyper-Kamiokande, the project will focus on work to optimize triggering, calibration and reconstruction of neutrino interactions, in particular at the lowest detectable energies. Hyper-Kamiokande will measure neutrino oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos, solar neutrinos, and other cosmic neutrinos. These measurements are in addition to accelerator beam measurements. The motivation for also pursuing these \u201cnatural\u201d cosmic neutrinos remains strong, as they will significantly contribute to the determination of the \u201cmass ordering\u201d of neutrinos and support and complement CP-violation searches and other beam-related neutrino measurements. Given enough running time, the detection of a neutrino burst from a core-collapse galactic supernova is assured. Such a burst will consist of tens of thousands of neutrino interactions within about ten seconds. Not only will the neutrino energy spectra, time distribution, and flavor composition directly give access to the explosion mechanism and other astrophysical data, but will also explore neutrino properties that cannot be studied any other way: in particular, neutrino-neutrino interactions may play a role. This will test the standard model of particle interactions in regimes otherwise inaccessible. Hyper-Kamiokande promises to give cosmic insights substantially advanced from our current understanding.\r\n\r\nThe award is aligned with the NSF Big Idea of Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-messenger Astrophysics as it coordinates the use of multi-messengers observations utilizing cosmic neutrinos and providing alerts to the larger community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
