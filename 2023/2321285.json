 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of three-dimensional (3D) printed battery electrodes that improve energy capacity and power performance. As batteries become an integral part of many products, from electronics to electric vehicles, the demand for high performance batteries is expected to grow considerably. The proposed technology may lead to advanced manufacturing techniques for Li-ion batteries that are well suited for consumer and wearable electronics \u2013 fields that are growing rapidly. Longer lasting high-performance batteries may help reduce e-waste by increasing device life. Supply of low-cost energy storage options also may lead to equitable access to energy that is critical for the use of technology. Additionally, these batteries potentially may be utilized in electric vehicles, which is a high growth industry attracting significant investment. Enabling the growth of electric vehicles through high performance batteries may have a significant impact on reducing carbon emissions. This innovation may shift the approach to battery development from materials discovery to process and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of ultra-thick electrodes (UTEs) using advanced aerosol jet (AJ) three-dimensional (3D) printing technology. Increasing electrode thickness reduces non-active components (e.g., current collectors, separator, etc.), resulting in large gains in energy density and a significant cost reduction. Increasing electrode thickness, however, delays the Lithium transport, causing poor power performance and capacity loss. Using 3D printing allows creation of UTEs without a loss of performance. UTEs created using the proposed process have been used to demonstrate improved charge times (7.5 minutes for 80% state-of-charge) and increased energy density (up 50% to 450 Wh/kg), by taking full advantage of the energy storage capability of the active materials.  In addition, preliminary results using the AJ printed battery show improved performance compared to conventional laminated structure. The silver-based 3D structured electrodes showed a 400% increase in specific capacity, 100% increase in areal capacity, and a high electrode volume utilization compared to a thin, solid silver block electrode. The proposed commercialization of this technology may advance battery development and change how batteries are manufactured.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
