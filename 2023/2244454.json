 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico is a critical natural laboratory for undergraduate students to explore issues related to water resource management, a crucial topic in today's society. With a highly permeable aquifer and rapid transport of contaminants to the subsurface, the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula has significant potential for groundwater pollution. This renewal REU site provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to conduct research in the field in an international setting, work with faculty mentors from four institutions, and gain a holistic understanding of water-related issues in the region. Additionally, the project will link the cultural and historical aspects of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula with modern water issues, helping to train the next generation of water professionals.\r\n\r\nSTEM undergraduates from underrepresented populations will work on five interconnected projects related to groundwater flow, anthropogenic pollution, inorganic and stable isotope geochemistry, and microbiology, under the guidance of experienced mentors. The data collected and analyzed will contribute to the overall understanding of groundwater system functioning and human impacts in the region. Through this project, students will learn responsible scientific research conduct, professional development, and contemporary water-related issues, preparing them for future careers in STEM fields.  The project will also focus on recruiting and supporting traditionally underrepresented students in STEM fields, creating a diverse community of future water professionals. Additionally, the project will share its research findings with the local officials in Mexico through the Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica de Yucat\u00e1n (CICY) and publish them in open access journals, making them accessible to scientists in Mexico and Latin America. This project's broader impact will not only advance knowledge of water resource management in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula but also improve undergraduate research training and contribute to a diverse and inclusive community of water professionals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
