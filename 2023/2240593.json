 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Coastal Ecosystems Research Experience for Teachers (CE-BIORETS) Site award to Florida International University (FIU), located in Miami, FL, will support the training of 24 teachers for 8 weeks during the summer and up to 44 weeks during the academic year. During 2023-2025, three cohorts of teachers will participate in coastal ecosystems research, develop and implement new curriculum, and inspire students to pursue STEM careers. Designed for local teachers, this project will target teachers in school districts that serve the highly diverse student population that is over 93% underrepresented in southeast Florida. Teachers in the program will develop instructional materials that: 1) are standards-aligned; 2) engage students in research; and 3) advance the understanding of coastal ecosystems. This CE-BIORETS will influence the quality and delivery of learning experiences for teachers and students, foster engagement, and create competent 21st century STEM graduates. Project outcomes will be assessed through classroom implementation of curricula, public symposia for teacher/student presentations, and formative and summative evaluations by an external evaluator.  To ensure the advancement of DEI goals, candidates will be selected from schools with large, underrepresented populations.\r\n\r\nThis project is housed in the Institute of Environment and focused on the Coastal Ecosystems of South Florida. Research projects will examine ecological processes of the Everglades, mangroves, seagrass beds, and/or coral reefs with cross-cutting themes related to conservation, environmental forensics, and public health, among others. This CE-BIORETs program leverages NSF CREST, REU and LTER programs at FIU.  The program will include a field/lab research experience, presentation of results, curriculum development and implementation, ethics/responsible conduct of research training for mentors/participants, and an annual interview of mentor/participant experiences for program assessment. Applications are accepted through the NSF ETAP system. The PI and CoPIs will begin reviewing applications on the due date and continue until filled or April 30. Teachers from Florida are encouraged to apply. More information about the program is available by visiting https://environment.fiu.edu/get-involved/index.html or by contacting the PI (Nicholas Oehm, oehmn@fiu.ed) or co-PI (Bryan Dewsbury, bdewsbur@fiu.edu)\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
