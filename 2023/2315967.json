 "awd_abstract_narration": "The funding will support early-stage researchers (students, post docs and junior faculty) to attend the Fluidization XVII conference (May 21-25, 2023, Edinburgh, Scotland). Attendance at the conference will ensure continued U.S. competitiveness in the fundamental research and emerging applications of fluidization for novel fluidization technologies field. Over the past few decades, notable advances in the fundamental understanding of fluidized systems have been possible via a combination of careful experiments, simulations, and theory. Nonetheless, the understanding and accurate prediction of fluidized system is nowhere near its single-phase counterparts, in which software like computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers provide a reliable tool for design and scale-up. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this proposed effort include: (i) bringing together members of industry, academia and national laboratories to showcase different perspectives and approaches, as well as to encourage potential collaborations; (ii) encouraging active participation by graduate researchers and post docs who represent the future of the field; (iii) bringing scientists and engineers together to provide an inviting and inclusive atmosphere to openly discuss their disciplines and approaches, thereby motivating new collaborations and new lines of inquiry;, (iv) going beyond the technical content associated with new research, and bringing to the foreground content related to education, professional development, and diversity and inclusion; and (v) particular outreach to underrepresented groups in STEM at all levels \u2013 conference organizing committees, invited speakers, and participants. The NSF support will be provided to emerging scientists (students, postdocs, and junior faculty) and underrepresented groups to ensure a diverse audience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
