 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support student attendance at the 38th Annual Computational Complexity Conference (CCC), in Warwick U.K., July 17 to 20, 2023. The field of computational complexity forms the backbone of theoretical computer science. The conference aims to foster research in all areas of computational complexity theory, studying the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints. The search for efficient algorithms has important ramifications in many areas of business, technology, and science. Complexity theory has helped with our understanding of fundamental difficulty underlying algorithmic issues and in turn has been able to motivate algorithm design for some of the most challenging computational problems.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide partial support to approximately 12 students to attend this top conference in the area of complexity theory. Efforts will be made to support students from under-represented groups and geographic diversity among students will also be taken into account. The award will encourage and facilitate student participation in this top-tier computer science conference. It will contribute towards attracting more under-represented groups to computer science research, giving students an opportunity to engage in the important technical, professional, and social exchanges that CCC fosters.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
