 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project consists of advancing methods for preparing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for sequencing. Prior to sequencing a biological sample, DNA must be liberated from cells and separated from proteins and other unwanted debris, and then mixed with specialty buffers and chemical agents. This skilled task is currently carried out by trained scientists using largely manual manipulations of the samples and expensive equipment. The alternative method proposed in this project will speed-up diagnoses from genomic sequencing by significantly reducing preparation time while also making preparation more reliable through automation. Notably, the proposed approach is expected to prepare DNA without reducing its length; consequently, the process should be ideally suited for preparing samples for emerging long-read sequencing technologies. These improvements have the potential to decrease the burden and costs associated with DNA sequencing, hence expanding the benefits of DNA sequencing technology to wider segments of society.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relies upon a process for trapping genomic material in a small flow cell through which an electric field and pressure-driven flow are simultaneously applied. The process is highly selective towards strands of DNA or (ribonucleic acid) RNA; proteins and other, unwanted debris that enters the flow cell passes through. Also, the process is relatively gentle, so the length of sample should not be shortened as a result. This project will advance the technology to the marketplace by: (1) Completing cartridge design details and fabrication, including evaluation of material options; (2) Building a custom research and development platform for interfacing with the cartridges; (3) Developing methods for DNA sample extraction and transfer; (4) Developing the library preparation protocols using mixing and heating while toggling the Electro-Hydrodynamic Trapping; and, (5) Integrating the entirety of the preparation process into a single cartridge and validating the process performance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
