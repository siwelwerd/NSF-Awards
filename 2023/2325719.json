 "awd_abstract_narration": "On February 3rd, 2023, a freight train derailment occurred in East Palestine in the State of Ohio. Following the train derailment, various hazardous chemicals, including butyl acrylate (BA), vinyl chloride (VC), and combustion by-products (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) from a \u2018controlled burn\u2019 of the remaining VC and BA in the train cars, were released into nearby soils, sediments, groundwater aquifer, and waterways including the Ohio River which serves a source of drinking water for more than 5 million people. As of May 29, 2023,  EPA and Norfolk Southern continue to 1) conduct air monitoring onsite and in the surrounding communities and 2) clean up the derailment site by excavating/disposing of  contaminated soils and collecting/removing contaminated wastewater. This RAPID project will test the hypothesis that in contaminant-impacted areas, microbial communities will show measurable responses to the release of toxins, and that these responses could inform about contaminant degradation/detoxification processes and natural attenuation potential. To test this hypothesis, the Principal Investigator (PI) and co-investigators from the University of Tennessee (UT) Knoxville and the environmental consulting company Microbial Insights in Knoxville (TN) will collect and test soil, sediment, and groundwater samples from impacted areas and those not impacted by pollutants released during the East Palestine accident. Specifically, the project team proposes to combine measurements of biomarkers with complementary cultivation-based efforts of microorganisms that are known to degrade the classes/types of chemical pollutants that were released following the East Palestine train derailment. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of fundamental knowledge to guide and inform the design and implementation of effective pollutant remediation solutions at the East Palestine derailment site and in nearby communities. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of one graduate student and three undergraduate students at UT Knoxville. \r\n\r\nFollowing the East Palestine train derailment, various hazardous chemicals, including vinyl chloride, butyl acrylate, other volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (VOCs and SVOCs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), etc. were released into nearby soils, sediments, groundwater aquifer, and waterways including the Ohio River. However, to date, there has been limited fundamental investigations of the fate and transformations of the hazardous chemicals that were released into the environment three months after the East Palestine accident. The overarching goal of this RAPID project is to establish that microbial communities in impacted areas will show measurable responses, and that these responses could inform about contaminant degradation/detoxification processes  and natural attenuation potential at the East Palestine accident site and in nearby soils, sediments, groundwater aquifer, and waterways. The specific objectives of the research are to 1) carry out time-series sampling of soils, sediments, and groundwater in impacted and non-impacted (background) areas, 2) conduct quantitative tracking of contaminant-degrading microorganisms, their dynamics, and their activities in response to the contamination, 3) design and conduct a targeted microcosm treatability study that demonstrates degradation of contaminants by indigenous microorganisms, and 4) synthesize the collected information and research findings to guide and inform the design of a site-specific monitoring program. The successful completion of the proposed research has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of new data and fundamental knowledge to guide the design and implementation of site-tailored monitoring protocols that could comprehensively assess the natural attenuation and contaminant degradation/detoxification potentials of indigenous microbiomes at the East Palestine site and in nearby communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Sediment, surface water, and private well water samples were collected in the East Palestine watershed in two sampling campaigns (June 11 and Nov 6, 2023) to assess the presence and potential contributions of native microorganisms to the degradation of VC and BA. Samples were collected from 17 locations, including Sulphur Run, Leslie Run, Little Beaver Creek, and nearby waterbodies, and five private drinking water wells located along Leslie Run.</p>\n<p>DNA was isolated from all samples to enumerate biomarker genes related to contaminant degradation using quantitative PCR (qPCR). The 16S rRNA genes of organohalide-respiring&nbsp;<em>Dehalococcoides</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Dehalogenimonas</em>&nbsp;were detected&nbsp;in&nbsp;more than half&nbsp;of the sediment samples at abundances reaching 10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;cells&nbsp;g<sup>-1</sup>. Biomarkers for aerobic VC degradation (i.e.,&nbsp;<em>etnC</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>etnE</em>&nbsp;genes) were also detected in sediment samples.</p>\n<p>Sediment laboratory microcosms explored if native microorganisms have the capacity to degrade VC and BA. All oxic and several anoxic microcosms degraded VC. BA is readily degraded with available oxygen, and this study demonstrated BA catabolism under anoxic conditions. These findings indicate that native microbiomes have the capacity to degrade VC and BA under geochemical conditions expected to occur in the watershed. qPCR demonstrated that exposure to VC led to a substantial increase of&nbsp;<em>Dehalococcoides</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Dehalogenimonas</em>&nbsp;biomarker genes, and all oxic microcosms that were challenged with VC showed a significant increase of aerobic VC degradation biomarker genes (i.e.,&nbsp;<em>etnC</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>etnE</em>). The makeup of the microbiomes was monitored with the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing technique, and exposure to VC resulted in increases of bacterial populations known to degrade VC under oxic and anoxic conditions.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, qPCR detected anaerobic VC degradation biomarker genes in drinking water wells, even though VC was never detected in well water.

The microcosm treatability study and the qPCR data support strong potential for microbial detoxification of both VC and BA in the East Palestine watershed, emphasizing the value of these methods for assessment of natural attenuation potential.</p>\n<p>2. Three days after the derailment, a &lsquo;controlled burn&rsquo; was initiated. The burn provided a solution to quickly return to normal railroad operations with clear economic benefits; however, the trade-off adopted was the uncertainty associated with the formation of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans with potentially long-lasting impacts on human and environmental health. In retrospect, the burn was an erroneous decision, highlighting the need of guidance documents that provide clear information to decision makers and first responders. Major VC spills have historically occurred once per decade, and manufacturers of VC, the U.S. Department of Transportation (which regulates the transportation of toxic chemicals), toxicologists, and environmental scientists and engineers have the opportunity (mandate) to develop guidance documents that provide clear information to decision makers so that solutions that best protect human and environmental health can be implemented.</p>\n<p>3. Transporting toxic chemicals such as VC creates an inherent risk that can be minimized by co-locating manufacturing and processing (i.e., the production of polyvinyl chloride, PVC) industries.</p>\n<p>4. Hydrogeological information can predict the fate and transport of the toxins and alert residents of potential dangers associated with drinking water following a spill. Unfortunately, no such information was available for East Palestine, highlighting the value of hydrogeological information.</p>\n<p>5. A lack of understandable, non-technical communication leads to misconception, misinterpretation, and confusion, and erodes the public trust in both science and government.
