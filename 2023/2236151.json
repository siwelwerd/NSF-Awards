 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coasts and islands are at the epicenter of two compounding challenges: variability in climate and the impact of development. Assessing the full scope of these challenges requires going beyond what is physically visible or on the surface of these environments. This is especially the case in coastal and island environments with karst, landscapes in which water forms a distinct topography including caves, sinkholes, and groundwater aquifers. Past and ongoing exploration, scientific study, and conservation work in the coastal karst systems in the US territory of Puerto Rico (PR) illustrate what is at stake with the study and conservation of karst. While 20% of the United States (US) is karst, it is the source of 40% of the American public\u2019s drinking water. In Puerto Rico these values are much higher, given that 37% of the territory is karst. \r\n\r\nDrawing from theories and methods in Science and Technology Studies (STS), anthropology, and geography, this collaborative project between West Virginia University and the American Geophysical Union examines the past and current role of mostly non-traditional actors and their volunteer-based organizations dedicated to the exploration, science, and conservation of karst in its varied forms. This knowledge will make an original contribution to the history, present challenges, and future of geology, archaeology, and other kindred sciences focused on critical zones environments in the US. Data will include archival information, interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic field-based visits with participants. This data will be used to generate the spatial and social networks undergirding coastal karst science and conservation efforts mostly carried out by cave explorers, scientists, conservation practitioners and volunteers. The STS-informed Ecologies of Participation Framework will inform this network analysis which aims to operationalize the who, what, and how of participation in ongoing socio-technical and environmental change. Results will be disseminated in both Spanish and English to a broader audience using ArcGIS StoryMaps, an effective web-based and interactive platform. These results will not only be valuable for communities living on or near karst systems everywhere, but they are also important for the general public given karst\u2019s national and cultural value.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
