 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative project between the University of Oklahoma and Colby College. The award funds conferences that will be held in Oklahoma and Maine. The goal of the conferences is to develop new research collaborations for US scholars, including international collaborations. The conferences will focus on auction economics and network economics. The conferences will stimulate new ideas in these areas of economics. Speakers who adopt different methodological approaches will be invited. The conference organizers will target researchers from other EPSCoR states for participation, including researchers from institutions in Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Hampshire, and Vermont. Students will also participate and present their research in student-focused sessions.\r\n\r\nSpecific topics include (i) Structural econometrics of auctions and networks; (2) The use of lab and field experiments in the study of auctions and bargaining; (3) Applications of auctions to a range of settings, including government procurement, charity auctions, environmental auctions, and multi-unit auctions; modeling discrete strategic actions, especially entry behavior in auctions; (5) Public policy issues in auction design.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
