 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in research on magnetism and magnetic materials are occurring in geophysics, geochemistry, nanoscience, condensed-matter physics, and to a great extent, along the boundaries between these fields. An interdisciplinary discussion of critical developments in the applications of fine particle magnetism in the geosciences, as well as their fundamental physical foundations, will help to advance our understanding of Earth's surface environment, tectonic history, and its deep interior dynamics. This award supports the Conference on Rock Magnetism and its Applications, June 5-8, 2023 in Minneapolis, MN, continuing a biennial series of conferences started in 1992. \r\n\r\nThe broad goal of the Summer Conference series is to bring together present and future leaders in the field for in-depth discussion of fundamental aspects of rock and mineral magnetism, and applications in global geophysics, tectonics, extraterrestrial magnetism, and surficial\r\nenvironmental studies; these discussions are intended to be more intensive, interactive and sustained. One explicit aim of the 2023 conference is to explore iron cycling through time and a leading expert on the biogeochemistry iron cycle will be invited as a keynote speaker and participant. Another key objective is to discuss grand challenges in paleogeography and tectonics. Students and early career researchers will be supported to attend the meeting. A session is planned to discuss increasing diversity in the US paleomagnetism and rock magnetism community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
