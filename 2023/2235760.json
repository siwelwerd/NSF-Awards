 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving teaching and learning in large introductory physics courses. This collaborative project involves investigators at Seattle Pacific University (Award DUE-2235760), the University of Washington Bothell (Award DUE-2235744), and Western Washington University (subaward). Introductory physics courses are important for STEM education and workforce preparation. Active, student-centered instruction results in better student learning. However, in large classes, it can be difficult for instructors to provide this kind of instruction effectively. Learning Assistants (LAs) can help instructors make their courses more active and student-centered if the LAs are prepared to respond to students' diverse ideas about science. LAs need both weekly content preparation and a pedagogy course to teach them the main theories and practices in teaching and learning. There are many LA programs. They have been shown to support active learning, but they do not necessarily prepare LAs to respond to students' diverse science ideas. This project will develop a model for training LAs to effectively elicit and build on students' science ideas. LAs trained in this way will promote equity by helping students learn physics better and connect physics to their life experiences.\r\n\r\nIntroductory physics courses are often required for a broad range of STEM majors. These courses are ideal environments for leveraging the benefits that LAs can offer, because the courses are typically large and need LA support for active learning, and the course enrollment typically reflects significant underrepresentation of marginalized groups. Towards the goal of improving LA professional development the project will pursue three objectives. First, is to investigate the fruitful ideas that LAs use to think about teaching and learning, and communicate these through a set of LA \"personas\" that characterize the common assets, goals, concerns, and values that LAs have for teaching. Second, is to develop and test effective instructional materials for LA pedagogy courses (e.g., reading assignments, reflection prompts, in-class activities, projects). Third, and finally, is to amplify diverse LA voices by recruiting and supporting LAs from diverse backgrounds to participate in the LA programs that the project develops and studies. The investigators refer to their enhanced approach to LA training as \"TRELLIS: Training to Elicit and Leverage Ideas about Science,\" based on the notion that the knowledge, skills, and perspectives that this kind of training promotes become a \"trellis\" that enables LAs to support physics students' fruitful ideas about science. The physics-specific pedagogical preparation that this project will develop will be immediately relevant to many LA programs nationwide and should serve as a model for extension to other disciplinary contexts. The NSF IUSE: EDU program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
