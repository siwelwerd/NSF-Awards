 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Missouri's (MU) X-ray Microanalysis Laboratory is an analytical and scientific imaging facility run by faculty members PI Selly and Co-PI Schiffbauer. While capable of analyzing an array of samples, the facility specializes in imaging paleontological specimens. The PI team consists of five expert paleontology faculty members from across MU's campus. Their research encompasses a wide range of topics, from studying the evolutionary history of crocodiles to investigating Precambrian tube worms. One of the primary instruments in the facility is the Zeiss Xradia 510 Versa X-ray tomographic microscope (micro-CT), which will be upgraded to the more capable 610 model, which includes a flat panel extension detector system, two new optical objectives, and a higher-power X-ray source. This upgrade will allow the lab to better serve the needs of Earth science researchers and those in other STEM disciplines by accommodating larger and denser samples, dramatically enhancing imaging speeds, and improving larger sample resolution size. Moreover, these improvements will offer a more engaging and hands-on experience for visitors and students. Rather than simply dropping off samples and receiving the data later, imaging can now be completed in significantly reduced timeframes, thereby enabling rapid and achievable opportunities in classroom and workshop settings.\r\n\r\nThe projects that will directly benefit from this upgrade include novel investigations into: the origins of the bilaterian body plan; selective preservation bias in the smally shelly fossil record of the earliest Cambrian Period; the evolution of soft-tissue locomotory and craniodental systems using contrast-enhanced scanning; the evolution of musculoskeletal systems; and soft-tissue degradation and feature loss during decay.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
