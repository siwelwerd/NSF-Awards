 "awd_abstract_narration": "Latinas\u2019 experiences in engineering programs can be unique due to the multiple layers of challenges and assets in their science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) journey: being a woman, being Latinx, being a bilingual speaker of Spanish and English. The disparities in Latinas\u2019 engineering access and attainment are the result of historically oppressive racist and sexist structures embedded in STEM space that perpetuate sexism and racism. However, there is limited research on the nuanced experiences of how Latinas resist inequities in different STEM educational settings and how they succeed. Another major shortcoming of the current literature on Latinx STEM education is that they are mostly viewed from a deficit perspective. This project aims to investigate how Latinas choose to engage in various resistance behaviors in different engineering cultures and campus climates and how these different cultures and campus climates influence their resistance. This project uses an anti-deficit view to interpret and make meaning of the experiences and assets that may have impacted Latinas\u2019 resistance and persistence in engineering programs. Findings from this study can be used to develop inclusive policies and counseling strategies to broaden the participation of Latinas and increase theirpersistence in STEM at both Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs).\r\n \r\nGuided by a combination of LatCrit theory of resistance, intersectionality, and Cultural Wealth Model (CWM), the goal of this project is to investigate how Latinas choose to engage in various resistance behaviors in different engineering cultures and campus climates and how these different STEM cultures and campus climates influence their resistance. Specific research questions include: (1) How do Latinas engage in different resistance behaviors in undergraduate engineering programs? (2) How do different engineering cultures and campus climates at Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) influence Latinas\u2019 resistance behaviors in engineering programs? and (3) How do Latinas\u2019 intersectional identities and their cultural wealth influence their resistance behaviors in different engineering cultures and campus climates? Using an interpretive phenomenological design, this project will conduct individual interviews with Latina students and qualitative surveys with faculty members and administrators from three PWIs and three HSIs in California, Florida, and Texas. Expected findings include more nuanced information about Latinas\u2019 resistance behaviors in engineering programs at PWIs and HSIs. Through sharing finding reports with participating institutions and broader STEM and Latinx communities, this study will provide needed information to promote Latinas\u2019 access and persistence in engineering programs. PWIs and HSIs could utilize the findings from this study to develop retention and recruitment policies and practices to broaden the participation and promote equity and inclusion for underrepresented minority students majoring in engineering and entering STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported  by  NSF's EDUCore  Research  (ECR)  program.  The ECR program emphasizes  fundamental  STEM  education  research  that  generates foundational  knowledge  in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and  enduring:  STEM  learning  and  STEM  learning  environments, broadening  participation  in  STEM,  and  STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
