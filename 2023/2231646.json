 "awd_abstract_narration": "Healthy soils are needed to sustain life, to grow food, to provide shelter, to provide resilient infrastructure, and to enable mobility, but there is presently a lack of knowledge about many key aspects of soil and its dynamics such as variations in the moisture and organic matter content, and how these variations affect soil health and stability. The Center for Soil Technologies (SoilTech) is a partnership among the University of Southern California, Iowa State University, the University of Connecticut, and the University of Washington to address this knowledge gap with a mission to support industries related to agriculture, defense, energy, and environment. By convening researchers across the nation with complementary areas of expertise, and by recruiting Industry Advisory Board members from a broad range of industry, foundation, and government organizations, SoilTech will make crucial progress in understanding soil dynamics. SoilTech will serve as a first-of-its-kind hub for technical exchange and research among these organizations, providing inter-disciplinary knowledge synthesis and broad applications of its research. SoilTech\u2019s participating sites have strong education and outreach programs. These programs will train the next generation of workforce in soil measurement and monitoring practices that will broadly benefit society. \r\n\r\nThe research teams at SoilTech are poised to make significant advances in the understanding of dynamic processes in soils through four research themes - Soil Sensors and Sensor Networks; Soil Modeling and Data Analytics; Soil Carbon Capture and Accounting; and Soil Health and Sustainability.  SoilTech-enabled research will meet a number of unaddressed needs in industry sectors. Research topics include the development of resilient in-ground sensors and sensor networks, soil modeling and analytics for decision support, standardization of carbon accounting methodology, and developing holistic soil health initiatives such as contaminant mitigation and support for precision agriculture. SoilTech will provide the underlying research necessary to develop efficient and sustainable ways of understanding soil properties and managing natural resources. University Connecticut (UConn) contributions will focus on soil sensors and soil heath based on its research expertise. UConn has multiple world-class facilities to support SoilTech and foster partnerships with entrepreneurs. These resources include the Institute of Environment, Institute of Material Science, Agricultural Extension Station, Science I Research Center, and the newly inaugurated Innovation Partnership Building.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
