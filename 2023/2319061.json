 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of technology to improve the quality of 3D printed polymer parts. Despite the promise of 3D printing technology, it is still far from meeting its full potential.  Although it offers low-cost, accessible part fabrication with geometric accuracy sufficient for many applications, polymer 3D printed parts often have poor strength (less than 20% of that of injection molded parts) and are not yet ready to be used as load-bearing parts. Poor filament-to-filament adhesion is at the heart of such problems in polymer 3D printing.  To address this key technological challenge, a print-head has been developed containing additional metal pre-heater and post-heater components, which provide additional thermal energy in a highly localized manner to delay the cooling curve and improve filament-to-filament adhesion. The proposed print head is an add-on or plug-and-play device that may result in a simple add-on that can be fitted into almost any existing filament-based 3D printer.  If successful, the improved quality and reduced cost of polymer 3D printing enabled by this technology will help print high-performance parts that may go into a variety of engineering systems. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of an in situ metal heater integrated with the regular filament-dispensing nozzle in a polymer 3D printer to improve the mechanical strength of printed parts. The additional thermal energy provided by the heater helps improve the filament-to-filament adhesion through reduced rate of cooling during the printing process. This has been shown to lead to improved mechanical strength and other properties of the printed part. Parts printed with the proposed technology may be suitable for challenging and complex engineering systems where the parts are expected to withstand significant load. This will help elevate polymer 3D printing technology from being able to print prototypes to one that can produce real-life parts. If successful, parts printed with this product may enable applications that are not possible with the current manufacturing technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
