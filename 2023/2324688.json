 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over 10 million fossil specimen records are publicly available via online portals, such as GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility). However, researchers are currently unable to realize the full potential of these data because they are difficult to find and use due to the bio-focused nature of the portals. This project aims to: (1) leverage the Paleo Data Working Group's (PDWG) decade-long leadership to connect existing open science cyberinfrastructure resources in a network that will better integrate data from fossil and biological collections; (2) democratize access to collections-based, digitized paleontological data for research; and (3) expand PDWG's successful community-of-practice model to further build capacity for improving and mobilizing data from fossil collections. \r\n\r\nPaleontology, situated at the intersection of geo- and bioscience, is an inherently interdisciplinary field with impactful research that has the potential to significantly contribute to better understanding the current biodiversity crisis in relation to rapidly changing global climatic conditions. This project will support transformational and translational research in these fields by driving development in the open data landscape, and improving discoverability and use of millions of fossil specimen records. It will target known cyberinfrastructure gaps related to taxonomy and stratigraphy by engaging with the paleontological collections and research user communities, in collaboration with cyberinfrastructure partners, to evaluate the existing technical landscape. These efforts will ultimately lead to the development of a roadmap for establishing an enhanced network of FAIR and research-ready data accessible via TRUSTed digital repositories (the \u201cPaleo Roadmap\u201d). The project goals will be accomplished through a community-based approach that centers the role of humans in open science cyberinfrastructure. Engagement of a diverse group of stakeholders - ranging from small collections to early career individuals - is central to all parts of the project and development of the Paleo Roadmap.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
