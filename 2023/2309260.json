 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a project to develop research-based educational materials that will help prepare future scientists and engineers for the demands of the second quantum revolution.  The materials developed will include Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorials (QuILTs) and peer-instruction tools focusing on quantum information science and technology (QIST) for undergraduate courses. These research-based learning tools will focus on helping students develop a functional understanding of concepts related to QIST, e.g., quantum measurement and time-development, entanglement, quantum computing, teleportation, and cryptography. \r\n \r\nGuidance and effective instructional approaches are critical in retaining traditionally marginalized students (e.g., women and racial and ethnic minority students) in science and in shaping their career choices. The guidance and scaffolding support provided by the QuILTs and peer-instruction tools have the potential to attract more traditionally marginalized students to pursue physical science/engineering major and careers related to QIST. Since the QuILT modules will focus on QIST concepts, they can be an effective approach to introducing students to the second quantum revolution and inspiring them to become future contributors in the growing field of quantum information science and technology as leaders in areas related to quantum computing, and quantum communication. First-hand exposure to QIST concepts and cutting-edge applications in QuILTs and peer-instruction tools can motivate students to continue learning those topics further. The tools will be disseminated broadly and will also be implemented at minority serving institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
