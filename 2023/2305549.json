These meetings bring together scientists from around the world to focus on research at the forefront of nuclear chemistry. The conference is organized in a way to promote significant discussion and time for collaboration throughout the week. \r\n\r\nThis award will provide partial support for a limited number of junior researchers to attend the 2023 GRC. The support for the participants will be selected by the chairs based on submitted abstracts of their research. This support will allow participants to attend these meetings who may otherwise not be able to attend. Participation of young researchers in these meetings plays a large role in the development of the future leaders of nuclear science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The program titled Patterns and Reactions of Exotic Nuclei included nine sessions on current topics in nuclear science of exotic nuclei, both experimental and theoretical. \n This was the first conference in the series since the Covid epidemic. The topics of these sessions were Science opportunities from new facilities, The origin of elements,  Fundamentals with stored ions, Experiments redefining shell structure at the extremes, Collective nuclear structure and emergent phenomena,  Nuclear structure of heavy nuclei, Angular momentum of fission fragments and Precision computations for nuclear structure and reactions, as well as a session on Late-breaking topics.  The presentations stimulated interactive discussions on the cutting-edge research going on in the field enabling the participants to gain insight into the on-going projects as well as develop an outlook towards future studies. Preceeding the conference on June 10-11, 2023, the associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) was held with 50 registered participants, of which 38% of were of international origin. The GRS focused on the topics of Advances in Nuclear Reactions and Astrophysics and Advances in Nuclear Structure, giving a dedicated platform for graduate students and postdocs to share insight into projects  at the fore-front of nuclear science.  \n \n A central impact of the 2023 GRC and GRS on Nuclear Chemistry lies in providing a platform for researchers from around the world to come together and define new directions of growth in nuclear science by addressing the most prominent questions in the field.
