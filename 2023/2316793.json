 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project managed by the Chemistry Division at NSF, Professor Tuhina Banerjee and her students at Missouri State University will be developing a series of light-responsive nanoscale enzyme mimics for colorimetric applications. This research will provide fundamental understanding about the important physicochemical properties of the nanomaterials, structure-activity relationships and basics of reaction kinetics mechanisms. Synthesized nanomaterials and their catalytic activity will be investigated using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. The proposed research will find broader application in the development of ultrasensitive colorimetric assays for bioanalysis, environment and biomarker detection. This project will provide scientific opportunities to diverse cohort of students especially members of underrepresented minority groups through cutting-edge interdisciplinary research experiences. Further, the research will be integrated in undergraduate curriculum at Missouri State, where students will acquire diverse skills sets and get trained in synthetic and characterization techniques that will have huge impact on their overall career development. Outreach activities will also be initiated for local high school students through workshops and lab experiences with the aim of encouraging diverse students to consider STEM careers.\r\n   \r\nProf. Banerjee will develop a new approach for enhancing the catalytic performance of nanomaterials that in particular exhibit mixed-redox states. She and her students will synthesize a series of light responsive cerium oxide-based nanozymes and explore the surface chemistry of cerium oxide, and investigate how its catalytic activity changes with plasmonic tunability. These new hybrid redox-active nanostructures will offer advantages over nanoscale enzyme mimics and natural peroxidases that have low catalytic efficiency. Further, plasmonic characteristics in these nanostructures opens up the possibility of achieving ultrahigh catalytic activity in the presence of visible light through plasmonic excitations and introduces an innovative approach of controlling reaction kinetics in a precise fashion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
