 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deer mice (Genus Peromyscus) are the most abundant rodents in North America and are used extensively by investigators all over the world for research in disciplines ranging from ecology and evolution, to genetics, physiology, public health and infectious diseases. Besides academic investigators, Peromyscus users also include other federal agencies in the U.S. and private entities. The Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center (PGSC) of the University of South Carolina maintains and distributes animals of 5 different species of Peromyscus. Support from this award will assist in the uninterrupted operation of the PGSC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mission of the PGCS is to maintain colonies of various species of outbred, genetically diverse deer mice (genus Peromyscus) and distribute them to investigators in the US and all over the world. Six different closed colonies are currently maintained, involving 5 Peromyscus species: P. maniculatus (2 colonies), P. polionotus, P. eremicus, P. californicus, and P. leucopus. For all animals generated in the PGSC, pedigree data since the original establishment of the colonies are available to external users. The availability of pedigreed animals, including animals from \"reference\" wild type populations, is of particular significance for research reproducibility.  In addition, specific small-scale experimental tasks can be performed upon request and are provided as contract research operations (e.g., DNA sampling, histologic analyses, special diets, ovariectomy, or vasectomy procedures). The PGSC also serves as a focal point for Peromyscus-associated research to accumulates and disseminate information to the communities of interest and provides training for visiting investigators on Peromyscus handling and colony maintenance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
