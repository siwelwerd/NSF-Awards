 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Quantum Computing and Information Technologies (QCiT) will map complex, but important practical problems in selected sectors of industry onto emerging and future quantum processors. Complex problems have very large number of variables that interact in complicated ways; such problems are challenging to solve on classical computers. Since future quantum processors are expected to be massively interconnected, QCiT will also investigate schemes for interconnection networks among processor nodes; this same type of network is also critical for high resolution and precision quantum sensors. Furthermore, when appropriately designed, quantum networks can be the basis for ultra-secure information systems.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of QCiT is to create and nurture an ecosystem where industry, government laboratories, including Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, work collaboratively with faculty and students on use-case problems that accelerate translation of\r\nquantum computing and information technologies to practice. This will be achieved by developing and constructing two critical test-beds: one for quantum computing, and another for quantum networks for investigating devices for quantum information encoding, transmission, and detection. Such a network permits investigation of protocols and algorithms for manipulating and processing quantum information. The two test-beds (i) unify the research efforts of the center by providing common overarching objectives, (ii) serve as developments tools for component and device technologies, (iii) provide platforms for developing practical protocols and algorithms, and (iv) provide an essential infrastructure for training a workforce in quantum computing and information technologies.\r\n\r\nClassical computing and information technologies have had transformative impacts on society. Quantum computing and the associated information technologies will radically change how information is processed and transformed. The ecosystem of the proposed center provides the foundation to address an unmet need of translating practical use-case applications to quantum computing research problems that can be readily solved and demonstrated in our unique test-beds, while simultaneously developing and training a multidisciplinary workforce that is essential for meaningful exploitation of the technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
