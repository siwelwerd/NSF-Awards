 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is to support participation of US based mathematics undergraduate and graduate students in the \"Potential Theory Workshop: Intersections in Harmonic Analysis, Partial Differential Equations and Probability\" to be held from September 28th till October 6th, 2023 at CIMAT in Guanajuato, Mexico. The workshop's webpage is: https://potentialtheory2023.eventos.cimat.mx/home_potential\r\nAnalysis is a foundational area of mathematics which has been in constant development over the last century, and which plays a crucial role in numerous other areas of pure and applied mathematics. The aim of this workshop is to strengthen the interactions between the harmonic analysis, partial differential equations and probability communities in Mexico and the US. The planned activities include a series of talks from leading experts, a school consisting of three mini-courses with problem sessions, a plenary talk, different panels geared toward advanced undergraduate students and graduate students and poster sessions for the students to show-case their research.\r\n\r\nThis project supports the travel and local expenses for 15 US based undergraduate and graduate students to the school. One of the planned main outcomes is exposure of US based junior researchers (undergraduate, graduate students and postdocs) to the forefronts of research in harmonic analysis, PDEs and probability highlighting their interconnections and to give them an opportunity to network with peers from the USA and Mexico and with established mathematicians from Mexico, Canada, the USA and Europe. This project is designed to establish/strengthen connections and increase the flow of people and ideas within North America. The diversity of participants has been of importance for the organizers throughout: when deciding on the minicourse instructors, plenary speaker, invited speakers, panelists, as well as participants supported by this project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
