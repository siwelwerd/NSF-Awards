 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThis project involves investigation of  the spontaneous structure formation of multicomponent polymer (soft matter) systems driven away from equilibrium by external forces.  The PI will specifically study the self-assembly of of porous nanostructures using polymeric materials called block copolymers (BCP).  Understanding the underlying formation principles and controlling the properties of multicomponent polymer systems driven away from equilibrium is an area of major fundamental as well as technological interest. If successful, the project will promote the progress of science by providing novel and scalable approaches to overcome limitations of size-selective filtration in asymmetric ultrafiltration membranes (which are important, e.g., for the biopharmaceutical industry) or for component recovery in industrial effluents. It will also enable access to soft-matter directed high-quality superconductors with novel form factors derived from additive manufacturing, which could have implications in areas including quantum information or energy technologies. The research program is highly cross-disciplinary, ranging from synthesis and characterization across non-equilibrium formation mechanisms of porous nanostructures to the study of polymer-derived superconductors and their properties. It would thus provide an intellectually highly stimulating educational environment for undergraduate and graduate students to learn about the depth and breadth of polymer science and engineering and its applications. The program will involve various components of training and development of human resources, including the participation of underrepresented groups, as well as industrial outreach.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThis project involves study of the synthesis, preparation, characterization, formation mechanisms, and properties of block copolymer (BCP) based multicomponent porous nanostructures obtained through self-assembly via non-equilibrium formation processes. Two different scenarios will be investigated employing multicomponent polymer systems: The first entails the formation of asymmetric ultrafiltration membranes from two or more chemically distinct BCPs exposed to non-solvent-induced phase separation. The second involves BCP self-assembly-based and 3D-printed sol nanoparticle composites and their conversion into superconductors with novel nanostructures and form factors. The broader aim of the research program is to understand the underlying fundamental chemical, physical, and kinetic formation principles enabling generation of materials with hitherto unknown property profiles based on control over their nanostructures. The research will include synthesis of all components, preparation of porous nanostructured materials, and characterization of their structure and properties using various scattering, microscopy, spectroscopy, and property measurement techniques. \r\n.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
