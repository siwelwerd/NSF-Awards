 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bioengineering is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field that lies at the intersection of engineering, physical sciences, life sciences, and medicine. Over the past two decades, it has emerged as one of the fastest-growing engineering disciplines, with a rising demand for bioengineers in various sectors, including industry, research institutions, and healthcare. To meet these evolving needs and foster a culture of innovation, inclusivity, and interdisciplinary collaboration, a revolutionary approach to engineering education is required. The proposed Revolutionizing Engineering Departments (RED) Adaptation and Implementation (A&I) project aims to integrate evidence-based organizational change strategies into the Bioengineering department to systematically transform the undergraduate curriculum. This transformation will be centered around project-based learning, real-world problem-solving, industry and clinical partnerships, and promotion of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in education. By doing so, the Bioengineering department at UCLA seeks to create a learner-centered environment that fosters innovation, improves the learning experience for students, instructors, and researchers, and aligns undergraduate education with industry and research demands.\r\n\r\nThe project will focus on three main objectives. Firstly, the integration of real-world projects and comprehensive skill training will be incorporated consistently throughout the curriculum. This will enable students to develop critical competencies such as technology proficiency, hands-on experience, design capability, problem-solving skills, teamwork, communication skills, and organizational management through project-based learning. Secondly, the project will build the necessary infrastructure and culture through partnerships with the university, medical center, and industry to facilitate the transformation of the education program. This will involve creating avenues for industry exposure, hands-on design experience, peer collaboration, open-ended problem-solving, and communication skills development. Lastly, the project will work towards creating an inclusive community for bioengineering training and education at UCLA and beyond, with a focus on promoting EDI in all aspects of the curriculum and educational practices. The outcomes of this project will have broad impacts on Bioengineering undergraduate education. It will equip the next generation of bioengineers with the skills, knowledge, and mindset needed to thrive in the industry workforce and address real-world challenges. Furthermore, it will promote EDI in engineering education, reducing gaps in performance and retention among student groups, and creating a more inclusive and diverse learning environment. Ultimately, this innovative approach to education will benefit the healthcare system and society as a whole, by producing bioengineers who are well-prepared to tackle the evolving needs of the field and make meaningful contributions to society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
