 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this EAGER project, a proof-of-concept protype of the Molecular Isomer Resolving Aerosol Collector and Analyzer (MIRACA) for measurement of the chemical composition of ambient organic aerosols will be developed and tested. The MIRACA will make measurements of both the particulate and gaseous components of ambient organic aerosol with a time resolution of 10 min to 1 hour. This high time resolution will be especially beneficial for studies of the sources and transformations of ambient aerosol and their impact on climate and human health.\r\n\r\nThe design of the MIRACA is based on the Aerosol Collector and Extractor System (ACES), an instrument developed with prior support from NSF. The ACES system will be extended to the measurement of gases and integrated with a liquid chromatography \u2013 mass spectrometry (LC-MS) instrument to fully automate all steps of collection, extraction, and analysis. The MIRACA will provide data at a high time resolution, avoid thermal decomposition artifacts, and enable an improved ability to resolve molecular isomers. The performance of the prototype MIRACA will be tested by comparing it with conventional samplers during measurements of laboratory-generated aerosols and biomass burning aerosols. The ultimate goal for the MIRACA is for it to include a liquid chromatograph - ion mobility high resolution mass spectrometer (LC-IMS-QTOF HRMS). \r\n\r\nThis EAGER proposal is novel and represents significant creativity and innovation. The development of this instrument will significantly improve the tools available for ambient high resolution chemical analysis within the atmospheric science community. The broader impacts of this research include the participation of early career scientists and students and will include outreach within the community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
