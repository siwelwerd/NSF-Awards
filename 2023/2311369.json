 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by providing opportunities for geoscience, environmental science, and other STEM faculty to consider actionable changes that they could adopt, adapt, and implement in their instructional and other professional practices. To achieve this aim, a five-day virtual conference for two-year college (2YC) geoscience faculty will be held to advance knowledge about improving 2YC student success and becoming a faculty change agent. The conference will be led by individuals who have (1) served as faculty leaders (change agents) on their campuses and in their regions; (2) written articles in \u201cCatalyzing Change: STEM Faculty as Change Agents\u201d (Baer, Layou, & Macdonald, 2022), a volume of New Directions for Community Colleges, about their work as change agents; and (3) written funded grant proposals. This professional development experience will prompt faculty to consider how to improve their teaching, strategies for inclusion, and student mentoring skills. These changes will enhance the recruitment, retention, and support of STEM students at 2YCs. This conference will also address barriers to 2YC faculty involvement in NSF proposal conception and creation, and provide support, feedback, and time for participants who wish to develop grant proposals. Increased 2YC faculty participation in federal grants could have a tremendous impact on the recruitment and retention of a diverse group of STEM workers as many students at 2YCs are members of groups historically underrepresented in STEM.\r\n \r\nProject leaders will convene a five-day virtual conference for 2YC geoscience faculty using articles from \u201cCatalyzing Change,\u201d most of which were authored by 2YC faculty who have led faculty professional development in the context of the SAGE 2YC (Supporting and Advancing Geoscience Education at Two-Year Colleges) program and/or have experience with funded grant proposals. Conference sessions \u2014 led by \u201cCatalyzing Change\u201d chapter authors \u2014 on effective teaching and student learning; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and supporting students\u2019 career and transfer paths will disseminate the content of the \u201cCatalyzing Change\u201d articles and aid participants in formulating ideas for future work as faculty agents of change and grant proposal authors. The interactive format of the conference will aid a diverse group of participants, many of whom may be new to leading faculty professional development and/or writing grant proposals in the past, in formulating ideas for moving their work forward on their campuses and developing individual or collaborative NSF proposals. The goals of the project are to grow the existing community of 2YC faculty change agents across the country, continue to advance the goals of the SAGE 2YC project, and encourage increased 2YC geoscience faculty participation in the submission of NSF and other grant proposals. These efforts will ultimately contribute to student success as faculty enhance their professional practices. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects and conferences to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
