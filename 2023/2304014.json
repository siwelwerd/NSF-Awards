 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Regional Innovation Engines Development Award is focused on Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE), an area of critical importance to the nation's security and future economy. In classical computing, information is encoded and processed in bits that can exist in one of two states, typically depicted as 0 or 1, and each bit acts independently.  Quantum bits (qubits) behave fundamentally different and can be placed in a superposition state, representing a combination of all possible configurations of the qubit. This can potentially solve complex problems beyond our current computing capability. Additionally, quantum systems can be entangled, which links the behavior of two separate items. This can increase quantum computing capability and provide unbreakable encryption in quantum communication. QISE has the potential to revolutionize all information science areas, and leadership in this field represents a huge economic opportunity. The region of service for this Development Award includes the states of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, which contain one of only two NSF-funded Quantum Foundries nationally, multiple existing quantum research groups, and multiple companies that are part of the Quantum Supply Chain producing not only quantum materials but also other photonic, electronic, cryogenic and classical computing components required to stabilize, encode and decode, transmit or interface with quantum computers and information systems. \r\n\r\nUniversity-led use-inspired research will include investigating quantum devices by Boise State University's Quantum DNA group, new methods of designing and fabricating topological Josephson junction qubits by the University of Wyoming, two-dimensional quantum materials, and quantum networking by Montana State University. Much of this work will collaborate with Montana Instruments, Teledyne FLIR, Cylynt, Quantel, AdvR, Wavelength Electronics, Micron, and Qubitekk. Collaborative research, with private sector input into performance requirements and vested interest in the outcomes, will improve the probability of translation of that research. The envisioned Engine team will comprise educational institutions at the university, community college, and Tribal college levels, incubator and accelerator entities, business alliances, economic development organizations, non-profits, and state and local government economic development-related offices. The team has a coalition of members with track records of success in accelerating advances in emerging technologies and industries, taking innovations to commercialization, supporting and creating start-ups and small businesses, workforce development, and catalyzing local and regional economic development. The Development Award will allow the team to strengthen and coordinate these emerging partnerships as they move towards an NSF Engine for quantum and supporting technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
