 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Delaware (UD) is building a storage and data sharing platform that will provide a sufficiently sized research data storage resource to enable big data and data science research. The system provides long term storage that includes data management tools that allow researchers to make their work much more accessible to the broader research community. This system is also an ideal solution to store long-tail data that has significant scientific value but may not be suitable for existing data archives.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, UD is acquiring two Open Storage Network (OSN) storage Pods that will each provide 1.6 PB of storage. These pods expose the storage through an S3 object store interface, and will be distributed between the UD campus and an off-site disaster recovery location. Along with these storage pods, data service nodes are co-located with each Pod to provide more robust data management services for accessing and interacting with the research data stored on these Pods. This will enable research data to be more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). 20% of the base storage of each Pod will also be made available to users outside of UD through ACCESS allocations. Educational and collaborative allocations are supported and encouraged.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
