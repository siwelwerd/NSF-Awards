 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the participation of US-based mathematicians, particularly graduate students and recent PhDs, in the workshop Model Theory of Valued Fields to be held at the Centre International de Rencontres Math\u00e9matiques in Luminy, France, from the 29th of May 2023 to the 2nd of June 2023.  The aim of this meeting is to present recent major developments in the model theory of valued fields. The meeting will bring together researchers from the model theory community with scientists working in other fields of mathematics which have witnessed successful applications of model theoretic methods in valuation theory, nonarchimedian geometry, and related topics.  \r\n\r\nThe workshop will be the principal venue for dissemination of work on the model theory of valued fields including results on globally valued fields, motivic integration, the use of transseries in o-minimality, characterizations of valued fields satisfying model theoretic tameness conditions, and imaginaries or quotients in valued fields, amongst other topics. Direct interactions occasioned by this meeting are expected to result in new collaborations. The conference website is at https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/2761.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
