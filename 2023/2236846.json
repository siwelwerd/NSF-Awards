 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the advancing domain of wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductor technology, electromagnetic interference (EMI) is one of the major concerns, resolving which needs significant research focus. The objective of this research is to perform multi-physics modeling and characterization of EMI and develop new active EMI mitigation methodologies to facilitate noise immune and high-density WBG power conversion. The novel filtering solutions as a product of this research are applicable to a broad family of power converter topologies with a variety of applications including motor drive, avionics, military, space, and data centers. Multi-physics EMI modeling and solutions developed in our research can be extended to application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)-level and power management IC-level high-speed micro-electronics. The research components of this project integrate electrical science, computer science, and mathematical optimization to advance the realization of next-generation WBG power electronics with physics-informed EMI models. The highly interdisciplinary nature of the project will benefit next-generation students with systems engineering, electrical, and electronics engineering backgrounds who will gain scientific knowledge and acquire engineering skills to develop noise-immune power electronic circuits. Overall, the long-term goals are to (a) employ the advanced EMI modeling theories into next-generation power electronics applications, and (b) train the diverse group of engineers to make them aware of the major design challenges in the power electronics field and well-prepared for addressing the future energy needs of the United States. \r\n\r\nIn this research, we propose new methodologies for analytical modeling of the EMI sources, propagation paths, and the coupling dynamics of parasitic noises by identifying the resonating circuit paths in a high-frequency power converter, and thereby synthesize new active-hybrid filtering compensation schemes. The fundamental breakthroughs proposed are: (a) development of mathematical model equivalents for common mode (CM) noise sources followed by estimation of parasitic components in high-frequency power converters, (b) studying the coupling effect of EMI on the control loop stability and dynamic performance in high-frequency power conversion, (c) formulation of a unified methodology for multi-constraint volumetric optimization-based EMI filter design for high-density power conversion, and (d) coupled topological integration of CM and differential mode (DM) filter networks for volumetric optimization and component count reduction. It is estimated that the topologically integrated active-hybrid EMI filters can achieve a power density of 50 kW/L, with a shrinkage of 70% volume compared to state-of-the-art fully passive solutions, while maintaining an efficiency of 99.8% and superior power quality (<1 degree phase displacement) and improved CM performance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
