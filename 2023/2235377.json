 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this planning grant a team of experts will work together to address some of the critical challenges for next-generation communication systems. Semiconductors, such as silicon, gallium nitride, gallium arsenide and indium phosphide, form the backbone of today\u2019s communication systems. For next-generation communication systems, however, multi-functional semiconductors are essentially required. Recently, ferroelectric ultrawide bandgap semiconductors have shown significantly enhanced electrical, piezoelectric, and linear and nonlinear optical properties compared to conventional semiconductors, which have made them one of the most promising materials for future communication devices. This project will facilitate forming a team of experts and establish research connections and industrial partnerships to enable the co-design of next-generation and beyond communication technologies. The planning phase focuses on seeding synergy and adding new researchers and external partners to the team to work toward three integrated thrusts, including co-design of materials and devices for ultrahigh speed communication technologies, epitaxy and heterogeneous integration, and co-design and demonstration of multifunctional energy-efficient devices. Success of this program will result in a multifunctional platform for the co-design of high-speed communication and quantum devices for future ultra-fast wireless and optical communication systems. The broader impacts also include the highly interdisciplinary nature of this project and outreach to undergraduates, underrepresented minorities, and K- 12 through the appealing potential social impacts of the research.\r\n\r\nThe researchers in this team will explore high-speed semiconductor devices by addressing the energy efficiency and connectivity challenges from ultrahigh-speed operation to a far-future goal of light-wave electronics and quantum information technology. Their co-design starts from wide and ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors, including the newly discovered ferroelectric nitrides and grafting-based heterogeneous integration, to spur advances in multifunctional electronic, acoustic, photonic, light-wave electronics, and quantum devices for future high-speed communication systems. The outcomes will ultimately include significantly improved RF power density, bandwidth, reduced power consumption of operation, enhanced\r\nsecurity, and possibilities to tap into quantum information with semiconductor technology. Team members from seven universities and four industrial partners, bring together expertise ranging from materials discovery, predictive theory for design, and state-of-the-art epitaxy/characterization to a broad range of emerging technologies. The team will ultimately focus on creating communication devices that reach 10-times higher speeds in a decade and potentially connect with emerging quantum and light-wave electronic components to revolutionize sensitivity and speed, respectively. Through this planning grant, they will identify the co-design challenges and opportunities for next-generation communication technologies, create a community outreach program, engage industry partners, and find new collaborators to complement the co-design team.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
