 "awd_abstract_narration": "Operating system (OS) kernels are the most fundamental software\r\ncomponent society depends on, underpinning the computing industry,\r\nfrom the clouds and datacenters that manage our data to the smart\r\nphones and other devices we all use daily.  Unfortunately, they have\r\ngrown to be complex and have not kept pace with advances in\r\nprogramming languages and modular software design, instead struggling\r\nto meet modern security and reliability threats to our computing\r\ninfrastructure.  Moreover, there appears to be no clear path to\r\nincrementally evolve them and their unchecked complexity has become a\r\nsignificant barrier to entry for students and practitioners to learn\r\nor innovate at the kernel level.  This project seeks to remedy this\r\nissue by create a safe kernel extension framework within the legacy OS\r\nkernel that enables it to be replaced in part or in its entirety with\r\nsafe components.  Through this extension framework, the project will\r\nenable a practical, incrementally-adoptable mechanism for\r\nundergraduate, graduate students and practitioners to evolve kernels\r\nto be safer and more reliable, improving national security and leading\r\nto higher productivity for society and the national economy.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to achieve three goals for the OS kernel: security\r\nand robustness through language safety, robustness and incremental\r\nupdate through componentization, and practical relevance through\r\nbuilding upon existing kernel extension frameworks. The key insight in\r\nour approach is that a safe kernel extension framework can be created\r\nwithin the legacy OS kernel that enables any part of it to be replaced\r\nvia bypass extensions, evolving the kernel towards a safe,\r\ncomponentized architecture, or in its entirety with a safe and\r\nspecialized in-situ kernel.  Our integrated research and education\r\nplan involves three broad research thrusts. First, we will explore\r\nexpressiveness/safety tradeoffs for kernel extensions, and will design\r\na new Rust-based kernel extension environment that provides similar\r\nsafety guarantees with a more expressive programming environment than\r\nthe popular eBPF kernel extension framework in Linux. Second, we will\r\nexplore to what extent our enhanced safe kernel extensions can replace\r\nindividual kernel components with bypass extensions and explore new\r\ncomponent boundaries in Linux. Finally, we will explore to what extent\r\nan entirely new in-situ kernel can be created from extensions,\r\nultimately in the context of Linux.  Our educational plan integrates\r\nthe research in courses and other initiatives involving open source\r\nand industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
