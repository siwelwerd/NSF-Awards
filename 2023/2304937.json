 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Todd Krauss and his students at the University of Rochester will explore new ways to interface single photons of light and matter, bringing chemistry into a field known as quantum optics.  A longstanding problem in quantum science concerns the requirement for systems to operate at ultracold temperatures in order to maintain quantum behavior, which is not generally practical. At room temperature, however, the random vibrations arising from heat energy causes matter based quantum systems to get out of step with each other, ruining the overall quantum state. Single photons of light have significant potential for preserving the quantum nature of states at room temperature because light is not affected by thermal effects. In practice, unfortunately, it is not generally known how to use light in this manner to preserve quantum states.  This project will take on this challenge while also helping to train the next generation of quantum information scientists, including supporting the increase of racial and ethnic diversity of the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce through a summer undergraduate student research partnership program. The team is also generating public excitement in quantum science through outreach efforts at the Rochester Museum and Science Center.\r\n \r\nThe overall goal of this project is to develop a detailed and complete, fundamental understanding of the photophysical properties of CdSe nanoplatelets (NPLs), such as exciton coherence, and the purity of single photon emission, which are relevant for photonic applications in quantum science. The giant absorption strength per nanoparticle, well defined surface chemistry on the large area faces, atomically flat surfaces, and efficient photoluminescence (PL) make CdSe NPLs very attractive for potential applications in quantum optics. Two specific aims are being pursued with the aims of advancing knowledge of NPL photophysical properties: 1) characterizing the photophysical properties of core-crown CdSe NPLs relevant to single photon quantum emission; and 2) establishing the relationship between physical morphology and photon emission properties for individual CdSe NPLs doped with Ag+ down to the single photon level. Through these studies, this project aims to develop an understanding of how the physical, morphological, and chemical properties of NPLs impact their single photon emission characteristics. In successful, this project could provide the field with a roadmap for generating bright and stable single photon emitters based on colloidal CdSe NPLs, which is essential for the future development of room temperature quantum-based technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
