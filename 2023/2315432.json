 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing a pre-research experience for undergraduate students in marine science to help prepare them to apply for and be successful in future undergraduate research experiences.  Undergraduate research experiences are a high-impact practice for STEM students, impacting their persistence in STEM, the kinds of career opportunities available to them, their professional skills, and self-efficacy.  However, not all students have access to undergraduate research experiences, or to the preparation necessary to find and successfully apply to them. Particularly in marine sciences, students' institutional characteristics and personal demographics can contribute to lack of access to these experiences. This project will develop a preparatory program for undergraduates interested in marine sciences who encounter barriers to fully access undergraduate research experiences. Through mentored projects with practicing marine scientists and community activities, participants will develop skills, confidence, and networking to overcome barriers to their participation in research experiences in marine science.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to serve three cohorts of students with historically excluded identities in marine science in an intensive week-long residential experience to prepare them for future research experiences in marine science.  This project builds on the institutional capabilities of Mote Marine Laboratory to connect students with mentors and projects in marine science, and to leverage expertise in community building and mentorship to support the students in developing self-efficacy and networking skills to increase their ability to find and apply for undergraduate research experiences.  The project will collect rich qualitative data to discover the impact of project activities on participants and stakeholders, and develop best practices in supporting minoritized students in marine science. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
