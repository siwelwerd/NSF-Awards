The AIM has, for over 25 years, been the world\u2019s leading forum for scientific and engineering researchers from all over the world who share an interest in mechatronic systems and control theory and the applications of systems and control technology. The conference will feature the presentation of contributed and invited papers, tutorial sessions, as well as plenary and semi-plenary sessions and workshops.\r\n\r\nThe IEEE/ASME AIM provides a unique opportunity for students to interact with members of the professional community in a stimulating setting and to exchange ideas with a broad group of colleagues. The large number of workshops and tutorial sessions during the conference and the interactive format of many of the presentations will allow additional opportunity for training and learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
