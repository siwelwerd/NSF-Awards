 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a cost-effective, transparent, aerogel-based window insert that can be used to make high-performance windows that will fit in a double-pane footprint and achieve triple-pane performance. This project will contribute knowledge to the technological challenges associated with scaling up an innovative aerogel manufacturing process. Use of these aerogel-based high-performance windows will improve the health and welfare of US citizens by reducing building heating and cooling costs as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This project will also contribute to the development of a diverse STEM workforce in the U.S. through continued and expanded collaborations with academia, to hire trainees and interns from diverse backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance knowledge in the manufacturing of large transparent aerogel inserts for high-performance windows. Use of the aerogel insert will allow the window industry to achieve triple-pane performance in the current double pane window infrastructure and meet the higher performance requirements of the 2022 ENERGY STAR specifications. To date, highly transparent inserts have been successfully manufactured at the laboratory scale and integrated into prototype window products. This Phase II project will scale up production of these inserts by: (1) completing installation and testing of a pilot aerogel manufacturing device, (2) scaling production of the aerogel material to pilot insert and batch sizes, and (3) producing pilot aerogel inserts in bulk for customer and industry partner testing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
