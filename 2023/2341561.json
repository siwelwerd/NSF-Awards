 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 14th International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation (IWBDA) 2023 takes place in Boston, MA USA from September 11th to September 15th. The event brings together researchers from electronic design automation (the practice of using computer software to build complex electronics) and synthetic biology (the forward design of novel biological systems using engineering principles). The goal of IWBDA is to make biology more easily, robustly, reliably, and predictably engineered and therefore, tackle challenges in biology and medicine, leading to advances in disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention. This award provides travel assistance for ten undergraduate and graduate students to attend this workshop to present research, participate in a computer programming competition, and network with a large community of industrial and academic researchers. These participants are expected to go on to form the foundation of the field in the future.\r\n\t\r\nThis award supports students to attend The 14th International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation (IWBDA) 2023 which takes place in Boston, MA USA from September 11th to September 15th. Specifically, these students join more than 120 researchers from electronic design automation and synthetic biology in a unique context which does not exist elsewhere. They have access to between twelve and fifteen technical talks over two days, two invited lectures, ten to twenty posters, multiple group discussion sessions, and a featured student programming competition (BDAthlon). This award covers the registration for the workshop as well as partial support for travel and housing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
