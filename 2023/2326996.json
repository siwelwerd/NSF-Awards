 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize various fields, including machine learning, cryptography, computing, and communications. The rapid growth in quantum AI and quantum security research has raised several open questions: What new capabilities are enabled by quantum AI? What are the security risks of quantum computing? What are the opportunities and business models of deploying quantum AI in practice? The workshop\u2019s novelties are bringing together researchers, experts, industry practitioners, visionary leaders, and relevant government agencies to identify key challenges and facilitate discussions on the current state of the art in quantum computing. The workshop\u2019s broader significance and importance are to provide valuable inputs to relevant government agencies, enabling new insights and breakthroughs in understanding quantum mechanics and its practical applications, and illuminating the challenges and opportunities in the areas of quantum AI and quantum security. \r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop aims to cover topics such as quantum machine learning algorithms, security issues of quantum AI, quantum AI for security, quantum-resistant cryptography, and the development of software tools and platforms for programming and simulating quantum computers. The workshop will provide opportunities for new learning, discussions to enable future collaboration and addressing key problems in the area. The videos of lightning talks, keynotes, and vision talks will be made publicly available on the website. A report on post-quantum AI will be prepared and disseminated.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
