 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and water contamination due to nitrogen fertilizers. The project will also increase agricultural productivity at lower nitrogen application rates using a novel concept of urea trapped in molecular cages. Nitrogen fertilizers can be serious environmental pollutants. Available alternatives are either too expensive for general agricultural use or cause unwanted residue buildup and are, therefore, minimally used. Pollution from nitrogen fertilizers remains a serious concern globally. This project's impact is directed at three targets: (a) Farmer income: the proposed nitrogen fertilizer may increase crop yields by 5-10%, improve farm profits, and improve the income of 10% of the US population; (b) US economy: the technology may boost the US economy by global export of this fertilizer; and (c) Environment and health: the solution may reduce greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution from nitrogen fertilizer.  \r\n\r\nThe project is aimed at the development of a novel fertilizer compound, where urea is trapped within a biodegradable molecular cage. The molecular cage is designed to bind urea within its structure to reduce its solubility and reduce pollutant production. Nitrogen is released from this cage only when the cage is dissolved by root secretions (such as organic acids). This technology is an intelligent release mechanism where an insoluble nutrient is released only on demand by the plant. The cage itself is constructed of plant nutrients therefore, when the plant dissolves the cage, it not only gets its nitrogen from urea but also consumes the cage because the cage is also food to the plant. To have a commercially successful product, the team will optimize the performance of the caged urea to meet agronomic and environmental targets and farmer acceptability. These goals will be accomplished by modulating the cage-link bridges to improve the trapping of urea, reducing volatilization by controlling the microenvironment modifiers, controlling emissions during production, and improving the physical properties for ease-of-farmer use. This project will help to develop caged- urea into an environmentally impactful, agronomically beneficial, marketable, consumer friendly, and manufacturable commodity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, the use of these conventional nitrogen fertilizers has significant environmental impacts. Nitrogen fertilizers contribute to environmental pollution by leaching into water bodies as toxic nitrate and volatilization as oxides of nitrogen contributing to global warming. Most recent solutions focus on (a) coating urea with polymers (plastics) to reduce their solubility and (b) on chemicals that deactivate the enzymes or organisms that are responsible for such transformations. However, cost factors, soil buildup of non-biodegradable materials, plastic accumulation in soils and lack of performance benefits have limited the usage of existing products.</p>\r\n<p>To overcome these challenges and provide farmers with an environment-friendly alternative, Agtec Innovations Inc developed a ground-breaking new fertilizer called &ldquo;caged-urea&rdquo;. &nbsp;This is a unique molecular structure where urea is trapped within a biodegradable inorganic &ldquo;cage&rdquo; consisting of interlinking phosphorus and calcium; both phosphorus and calcium are plant nutrients and hence beneficial additives. The structural framework itself is water insoluble but soluble by root activity. Urea thereby becomes part of the supramolecular structure, and this ensures some degree of protection from microbial enzymes thereby reducing nitrogen emissions and nitrate production. It leaves no toxic residues or microplastics because all chemical constituents are plant food.</p>\r\n<p>The major goal of this NSF-SBIR Phase I project was to develop our innovation into a market acceptable fertilizer formulation by meeting several challenging criteria of improving critical performance parameters.

By modifying the structural features of the molecular cage and improving the trapping of urea within it, using cross-linking agents, we could achieve our targeted goals for an optimized product. &nbsp;For this we have used the simplest of raw materials that consist entirely of plant nutrients that leave no residues in the soil.

Higher yields would provide further inducement to farmers for using caged-urea as a nitrogen fertilizer.</strong></p>\r\n<p>This scientific impact of this project is the development of a biodegradable molecular cage that can be used to reduce environmental pollution and improve efficiency for nitrogen fertilization.

Increasing agricultural output, could generate billions of dollars in revenue, elevate incomes across the population through greater food availability, and strengthen export opportunities for both agricultural commodities and our caged-urea product.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, our solution will contribute to better air and water quality, fostering long-term health benefits for the population. On a broader scale, this innovation addresses critical global challenges, including the climate crisis, food security, and public health, ensuring a profound and lasting impact on both domestic and international levels.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/05/2025<br>\nModified by: Chandrika&nbsp;Varadachari</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233044/2233044_10892809_1736097390604_Fig_1_caged_urea_structure--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233044/2233044_10892809_1736097390604_Fig_1_caged_urea_structure--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Fig. 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233044/2233044_10892809_1736097390604_Fig_1_caged_urea_structure--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Fig. 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Structural representation of caged-urea</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chandrika Varadachari</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chandrika&nbsp;Varadachari\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 1</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233044/2233044_10892809_1736097308910_Fig_5_Field_results--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233044/2233044_10892809_1736097308910_Fig_5_Field_results--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Fig.5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233044/2233044_10892809_1736097308910_Fig_5_Field_results--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Fig.5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Results of crop trials with caged-urea versus urea</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chandrika Varadachari</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chandrika&nbsp;Varadachari\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig.5</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233044/2233044_10892809_1736096905136_Fig_2_NH3_volatilized--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233044/2233044_10892809_1736096905136_Fig_2_NH3_volatilized--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Fig.2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233044/2233044_10892809_1736096905136_Fig_2_NH3_volatilized--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Fig.2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ammonia volatilized from soils with  caged-urea versus urea</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chandrika Varadachari</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chandrika&nbsp;Varadachari\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig.2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233044/2233044_10892809_1736098531188_Figure_3_NO3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233044/2233044_10892809_1736098531188_Figure_3_NO3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Fig.3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233044/2233044_10892809_1736098531188_Figure_3_NO3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Fig.3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Nitrate produced in soils treated with caged-urea versus urea</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chandrika Varadachari</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chandrika&nbsp;Varadachari\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig.3</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233044/2233044_10892809_1736097211239_Fig_4_N2O_emission--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233044/2233044_10892809_1736097211239_Fig_4_N2O_emission--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Fig.4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2233044/2233044_10892809_1736097211239_Fig_4_N2O_emission--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Fig.4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soils treated with caged-urea versus urea</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chandrika Varadachari</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chandrika&nbsp;Varadachari\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig.4</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
