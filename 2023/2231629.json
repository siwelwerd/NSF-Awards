 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project seeks to address two fundamental issues: limited access to aviation big data; and shortage of a robust workforce with integrated big data analytics and aviation competencies. The proposed Center for Aviation Big Data Analytics (ABDA) will advance research and education through discovery and innovation at the confluence of big data analytics and aviation. Its mission is to develop big data analytics solutions specially designed for the aviation industry to ensure the safety, security, and prosperity of the U.S Aviation Ecosystem.\r\n\r\nABDA has two sites: Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) and New Mexico State University (NMSU). The ABDA Center's research will focus on four thrust areas: (1) Data characterization and data requirement identification; (2) Development of next generation big data-enabled systems, services and applications; (3) Development of diverse ABDA-capable U.S. Workforce of the Future; and (4) Development of AI/machine learning solutions towards sustainable aviation. ERAU brings expertise in aviation data science and business analytics, flight research, unmanned aerial systems and autonomous systems, and aviation cybersecurity. Complementary expertise at other sites include energy-aware operations, flight energy consumption modeling, energy cost and emission assessment, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. During the planning period, ERAU will explore ways to advance diversity and outreach with the Gaetz Aerospace Institute, the Boeing Scholars program, and the Women in Aviation Chapter through recruiting prospective students, educating current students, and identifying student researchers.\r\n\r\nThe ABDA Center's research is expected to have three major societal implications: (1) to foster novel, transformative, multidisciplinary big data analytics/AI/machine learning approaches that ensure the safety, security, and prosperity of the U.S. Aviation Ecosystem, taking into consideration the unique challenges present in the aviation industry; (2) to foster a research community committed to advancing research and education at the confluence of big data analytics and aviation, and to transition its findings into industry practice; and (3) to collaborate with a minority serving institution site to recruit more underrepresented students and develop diverse ABDA-capable U.S. Workforce of the Future. \r\n\r\nAll data, software, and artifacts produced in this project will be archived and preserved, according to standard institutional security and privacy practices and policies, for at least five years.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
