 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel metabolite diagnostic blood test indicative of early-stage diseases including cancer, chronic heart and lung disorders, and diabetes.  The technology analyzes specific panels of blood metabolites indicative of changes in cellular function that occur with disease.  This technology reduces the diagnostic interval time from years to weeks or days, diminishes misdiagnosis resulting in improper therapy, and has the potential to alter the use of more invasive diagnostic methods such as biopsies, colonoscopies, and heart catheterizations from an exploratory to a confirmatory role.\r\n \r\n \r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to use specific panels of circulating metabolites measured using mass spectrometry (MS) and analyzed using artificial intelligence to detect chronic disease conditions. Pre-clinical models have demonstrated that alterations in metabolism occur at the stage of mild disease, before overt symptoms become evident. The first specific condition to be evaluated in this project is pulmonary arterial hypertension. The objective is to establish calibrated MS methods with quantified values of multiplexed metabolite panels in a reproducible manner as required for clinical use. Multi-label classifications will also be developed in order to detect and account for various co-morbidities that can affect overall metabolic changes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
