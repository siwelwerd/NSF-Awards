 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed Electrical and Electronics Engineers Magnetics Society Summer School being organized in Bari, Italy, from June 11-16, 2023, is to bring together an international group of graduate students doing research in magnetism and related areas. It consists of lectures by experts, poster presentations by participating graduate students, panel discussions about careers in magnetism, and a field trip to visit local research facilities. The program covers fundamentals and advanced topics in magnetism. It encourages a diverse group of students into the magnetics community. The most significant impact for students is the excitement of being able to interact with experts and discuss their personal research project. The Summer School provides opportunities to network and see how to interact professionally with people from a range of backgrounds. Lecturers will have both formal and informal interactions with the students. It is expected that 90-100 students will participate based on the selection from competitive application. \r\n\r\nThe ability to prepare and understand magnetic materials and exploit their properties in electromagnetic devices has revolutionized our lives. Current technologies enabled by magnetic materials include magnetic recording heads and media, non-volatile random-access memory, motors, energy-saving devices, and biomedical applications. The use of electron spin, in addition to electron charge, has led to the spintronics revolution. New materials and phenomena are constantly emerging.  Specific topics include history, fundamentals, simulations and theory, measurements and challenging applications of magnetism ranging from bio-to-computing. The grouping of lectures and discussions will address current challenges in the field, with emerging new ideas on topological materials with spin-momentum locking, magnon-photon coupling for qubits, strategies for low power and environmentally friendly magnetic devices, etc. The boundaries between these areas are constantly pushed to overcome challenges and identify new possibilities. The latest results in these areas will be presented to the students by leading experts. The students will develop their communication skills and feel more empowered to suggest new ideas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
