 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to facilitate effective use of tooth remineralization treatments by introducing a new tool that is both highly sensitive to demineralization and robust to confounding factors. If patients are compliant with the generally recommended dental visit schedule of twice a year, it is conceivable that the patient may never need to have a primary filling again. This change in practice has significant patient, dentist and broader economic benefits. The remineralization treatment may increase the number of patients who visit their dentist on a regular basis as they can avoid dreaded fillings. The savings from reducing the time spent on primary filings will provide dentists with the opportunity to take on new patients and procedures, while reducing more mundane drilling activities. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build on the technology developed for early dental caries detection and will develop the technology for clinical use and evaluation by dentists. This technology will enable dentists and hygienists to diagnose caries earlier than previously possible, enabling early treatment, and significantly reducing the amount of drilling in dentistry. This Phase II project will develop a probe designed for use in dental offices, a miniaturized and a ruggedized Brillouin spectrometer. The project will also conduct lab and user testing, develop software, and develop a scientific version of the spectrometer. At the end of this Phase II effort, a validated prototype that will be ready for a clinical trial is expected.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
