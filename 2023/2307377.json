 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project contains a new approach to an important class of problems concerning the long-term influence of deterministic or random perturbations of various systems and to the analysis of metastability of such systems. Intuitively, metastable behavior includes sudden transitions, separated by long time intervals, between near-equilibrium states of a system. This behavior is exhibited inside a variety of fields, e.g., in molecular dynamics, genetic mutations, certain economic models, etc. The long-term influence of small perturbations is an essential part of the perturbation theory - one of the main methods in applied mathematics. For various time scales, the main states of the perturbed system are investigated and described, along with the transitions between these states. These results enable introducing a measure of stability of the states with respect to the perturbations and considering certain optimal control problems. The project involves several graduate students working along with the principal investigator on related research topics. \r\n \r\nThe project approach is based on considering the limiting (in an appropriate time scale) motion on the simplex of invariant probability measures of the unperturbed system. In the case of random perturbations, the hierarchy of cycles and metastable distributions will be calculated using large-deviation-type results. These calculations will be based on a non-linear spectral problem for the corresponding partial differential equations. If the unperturbed system has a first integral, the construction is, in a sense, a generalization of the averaging principle; on the other hand, the limiting slow evolution for this specific case will be considered on a space that is more sophisticated than in the classical case. The results will lead to a description of a number of new effects, such as stochasticity in the long-time behavior of purely deterministic systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
