 "awd_abstract_narration": "Musculoskeletal disorders and diseases are the leading cause of disability in the United States and account for more than one-half of all chronic conditions in people over 50 years of age in developed countries. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports research to build a better understanding of these disorders and diseases, through the development of a novel framework to evaluate growth and development of the hip joint in infants. The outcome of the study will be to identify major factors that drive and regulate growth early in life that may have long-term benefits for prevention of early arthritis. This project will address a wide class of problems involving mechanics, computational morphometrics, movement science, and mechanobiology. The research is integrated with an educational plan to expose high school, undergraduate, and graduate students to novel joint growth and development concepts using hands-on activities, 3D printing, and 3D visualizations. These activities will encourage high school students, including females and underrepresented minorities, to pursue STEM careers and will help educate the next generation of engineers. This study aims to reduce the physical, social, and economic burden for children affected by developmental disorders by increasing awareness among the public, and improving treatments for better outcomes.\r\n\r\nIn this CAREER project, the PI will use experimental motion capture data, finite element analysis, statistical shape modeling, and multi-scale musculoskeletal mechanobiological modeling to develop a framework that provides non-invasive approaches to examine the dynamics of human movements. Infant\u2019s spontaneous movements generate forces that are constantly acting on the joints, which can affect the morphology and development of the soft bone. Using combined experimental and computational tools, this research will predict the complex adaptation of the joint to biomechanical factors, thus providing a basis for improved prevention and treatment of developmental disorders. Specific tasks include establishing a lower limb atlas of infant morphology using statistical shape modeling, using pediatric movement science to quantify physiological joint forces and moments, and applying sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to systematically evaluate how inputs to this framework affect predictions of growth and development. Results from the research will: (1) Provide experimental data and computational models that can serve as the basis for developing innovative solutions for infant developmental disorders; (2) Develop innovative tools to aid clinicians, pediatricians, and physical therapists when managing joint disorders; (3) Identify major factors that quantify morphogenesis early in life that may have long-term benefits for prevention of early arthritis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
