 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational thinking (CT) is often referred to as an analytical practice that involves engaging in problem solving, (re)formulating problems and expressing solutions in ways that can be carried out by a human or a machine. Opportunities to engage in CT during the elementary school years often occur in after school clubs or other informal learning settings. To increase the reach of these opportunities, this project will develop and implement a professional learning approach that introduces grades 3-5 teachers in three low-income schools to CT, supports their understanding of the math and science they teach, and supports the integration of CT into their math and science instruction. This project is funded by the STEM + Computing (STEM+C) program that supports research and development to understand the integration of computing and computational thinking in STEM learning. As computing has become integral to the practice of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), the STEM+Computing program seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (preK-12).\r\n\r\nGrounded in Wenger's community of practice and design-based instructional research, learning opportunities for teachers include: three, one-week summer workshops; monthly video clubs focused on teacher noticing (18 hours per academic year); in-class support; an annual mini-conference; and school, family, and community workshops. Across these activities, the project will focus on two pedagogical approaches: design thinking and project-based learning, and will involve educators in the curriculum design process. Data to be collected include video of teacher learning activities, teacher interviews, self-report surveys, artifacts and assessments of teacher knowledge of math, science and CT.  Outcomes of the project include teacher-developed project-based or design thinking lessons; a longitudinal understanding of teacher professional learning for promoting CT in the elementary grades, a scalable professional learning model, and a set of video teaching cases that offer teachers models of how to implement CT lessons in ways that recognize a variety of student thinking strategies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
