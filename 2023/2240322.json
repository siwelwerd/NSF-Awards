 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from addressing the gap between the ride hail and vehicle rental markets via the creation of a new, more accessible \u201ccar hailing\u201d mode of transportation. Based on technical advancements in vehicle safety and fleet logistics, car hailing technology offers the potential for direct and desirable social impacts, including: more equitable transportation that can improve quality of life and decrease cost of living; less personal vehicle ownership and less pollution as a result of more efficient vehicle fleet utilization; centralized, managed parking, which could free land for pedestrians, housing, and businesses precisely where it is needed most; and significant job creation due to the need for remote human vehicle operators. These societal and environmental benefits also directly translate into increased economic competitiveness of the United States: more equitable and available transportation for workers enables businesses to compete more successfully in the global markets, and improved quality of life and wage opportunities leads to more productive workers.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will help enable scalable commercial deployment of vehicle teleoperation technology and services by further developing and improving previous advances in robotics control, perception, and safety engineering. There are two primary objectives for the Phase II research. The first is to develop new techniques and methodologies in safety engineering that will enable the systematic testing and safety assurances necessary for large-scale public road deployments of vehicle teleoperation technology. The second is to revise and improve the novel control and perception technologies developed during the Phase I project to satisfy new requirements derived from the company\u2019s safety engineering advances. The results of the Phase II research will include robotics control and perception capabilities that significantly advance the state of the art, as well as a new set of safety engineering practices and methodologies that could serve as a foundation for the emerging industry of vehicle teleoperation and autonomous vehicle safety.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
