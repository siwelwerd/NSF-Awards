 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microwave and communications technologies have propelled the rapid growth of Internet of Things for many emerging industrial and consumer applications, which stimulates new research in the areas of analytical and experimental techniques for device modeling and characterization. This workshop will provide a forum for the multidisciplinary subjects of microwaves and communications engineering to promote interactions and collaborations in research and education among participants. Researchers and students from U.S. will be invited to participate. The outcome is expected to contribute to advancing microwave and communications technologies that will benefit developments of future smart cities and smart villages. The workshop will be held in in Cairo, Egypt, on February 5-6, 2023, and co-located with the IEEE International Microwave & Antennas Symposium (IMAS2023) on February 7-9, 2023. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will bring together research scientists, educators, and students to discuss new technological, experimental, computational, and theoretical advances in the processing, characterization, and multi-scale modeling of communication and microwave devices. It will focus on key technological challenges to develop smart cities and smart villages including their wireless infrastructure. The workshop will have multiple sessions with in-depth discussions to cover various research areas that support the developments of future smart cities and smart villages. Four themes/sessions of this workshop are: (1) Technologies for Smart Cities and Smart Villages, (2) Radar Technology for Civilian Applications, (3) Satellite and Space Communications, (4) High-Frequency Semiconductor Devices. The workshop will provide an opportunity for participants to network and explore international collaborations in microwave and communications technologies to benefit the research community and the global society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
