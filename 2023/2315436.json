 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing, implementing, and evaluating simulations that will improve evidence-based mathematics teaching practices. The project will create a suite of open-source, freely available simulations that support teachers to foster rich mathematical discourse in their classrooms. While doing so, it will advance knowledge of how to design simulation tools for teacher learning and will articulate design principles for creating technologies for teacher preparation programs. The project will also create open data sets of the mathematical dialogue and professional development materials so that other teacher educators can develop their own customized scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe project leverages the web-based AI-based Classroom Teaching Simulation (ACTS) Core system that enables teacher candidates to rehearse engaging with a student about a specific mathematical task while interacting with a dynamic mathematical visualization and then provides automated tailored feedback on teacher performance. Simulations will be co-designed with mathematics methods instructors and implemented within pre-service elementary mathematics methods courses. The goal is to provide automated feedback to pre-service teacher candidates on the types of mathematical questions they ask and evaluate the impact on pre-service teacher candidates\u2019 use of productive mathematical questioning during simulation settings. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.  The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program contributed to the funding of this project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
