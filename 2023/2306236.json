 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of this project is to enhance the undergraduate curriculum and provide adequate knowledge, hands-on training, and certifications in 5G broadband communications systems at Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU).\r\n\r\nThe project proposes to develop STEM talents in broadband communication systems at the undergraduate level by (i) developing a testbed on 5G communication systems for research and training, (ii) enhancing or developing broadband courses in the electrical and computer engineering department, (iii) developing an undergraduate certificate program in Broadband Access Technologies, and (iv) engaging community college students in broadband technologies via seminar/workshop during the summer. The proposed developments will be based on evidence-based teaching components relevant to current and future broadband needs, such as improving student mastery of skills in the 5G broadband domain. The research aspect of the project will focus on wideband communications, blockchain-based transactions, serverless computing, and security for cloud computing. This program will equip and motivate students historically underrepresented in STEM with the knowledge to complete baccalaureate degrees with an emphasis on the broadband field and build a career in broadband communications. The program will also engage community college students to motivate them to achieve four years degrees at PVAMU in STEM fields, especially in electrical and computer engineering with a concentration in broadband communications. Thus, the proposed activities will have a broader impact on the workforce and research development, contributing to nationwide broadband growth.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
