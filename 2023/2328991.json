 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract: The emerging field of Quantum Information Sciences and Engineering (QISE) will harness the power of quantum physics and advances in information technology to revolutionize the future information landscape through innovations in quantum communications, computing, sensing, simulation, and materials which are critical to economic prosperity and national security. With the rapidly growing interest and investment in QISE, this project seeks to address the critical talent gap for a diverse, skilled workforce in this new and strongly technology-oriented field through the establishment of a QISE research and education program at Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU) while leveraging existing significant QISE expertise at Virginia Tech (VT) through research mentoring and collaborations. The project activities will include: (1) conducting cutting-edge research in quantum communications and cryptography; (2) QISE curriculum development at both undergraduate and graduate levels with an emphasis on the hands-on and project-based learning modules; and (3) outreach activities through faculty development workshops and summer internships for underrepresented students in QISE. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: One of the greatest threats to the connected world is the security vulnerability of digital communication. The advent of quantum computers and its ability to quickly factor large numbers will be disruptive to current cryptography standards which in turn warrants the search for new approaches for secure communication. Quantum key distribution (QKD) utilizes properties found in quantum physics to exchange cryptographic keys between shared parties in such a way that guarantees perfect secrecy. This project will establish quantum optics (QuED) and QKD testbeds at PVAMU to facilitate research mentoring and collaboration community between PVAMU and VT in the fields of quantum communications and cryptography. The collaborative team\u2019s research will focus on: (1) performing feasibility studies of different quantum cryptographic protocols for satellite-based QKD by coupling network emulation environment with laboratory experiments based on photon entanglement demonstrators; (2) understanding the impact of noise on quantum algorithms; and (3) exploring non-entanglement based QKD approaches over fiber. The project outcomes will contribute to the security enhancements in critical applications such as financial, energy, health, education, and defense sectors. The collaborative project will also create a sustainable partnership between a Historically Black University and a majority institution to expand and diversify the QISE workforce through the curriculum development, student/faculty professional development opportunities, and connection to industry partners. The combination of research in collaboration with leading experts in the nation, high-quality teaching content, and experiential and project based learning paradigms will ensure success of the project.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (MPS/OMA), the Directorate of Engineering (ENG), and the Technology Frontiers Program (TIP/TF).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
