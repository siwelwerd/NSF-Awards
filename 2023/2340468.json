 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyberinfrastructure is an essential component of virtually all scientific research conducted today. As scientific projects have grown larger and more collaborative, the need to share data and algorithms has expanded, together with new mandates for open science and public sharing of datasets. The Cybersecurity Innovation for Cyberinfrastructure (CICI) program at NSF consists of a portfoloio of projects aimed at improving the security and privacy of cyberinfrastructure. As CICI has grown in scope and importance, there is a need to convene researchers in the program in a setting dedicated to CICI concerns. ASU will lead organize and host a two-day Principal Investigators meeting for CICI awardees, to be held on the ASU campus in early 2024.\r\n\r\nBy convening the CICI community, the meeting will foster increased intellectual interchange across the program, encourage collaboration and cross-fertilization among projects, strengthen connections to the scientific community, and identify important emerging trends and research questions.  CICI research projects enhance the security and privacy of cyberinfrastructure, which benefits individual scientific projects, promotes a resilient scientific ecosystem, and protects U.S. interests abroad. In particular, the meeting will identify synergies among projects and gaps in the current project portfolio.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
