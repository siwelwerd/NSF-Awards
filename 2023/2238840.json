 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award enables investigation of a novel method for modifying plasma waves towards generating application-quality electron beams.  Particle accelerators have provided transformative capabilities for scientific discovery, industrial applications, and medical advancements for over 60 years. Recent developments in the field of plasma physics have led to the emergence of plasma waves as a promising medium for very efficient particle acceleration. This is because these waves can sustain forces that are hundreds of times higher than those generated in conventional accelerating structures. This project leverages state of the art laser sources at the Brookhaven National Laboratory with the potential for enabling a new generation of compact accelerators and radiation sources.  The project will also contribute to developing a strong pipeline of undergraduate students, and in particular underrepresented minorities, into graduate plasma physics programs. This will be accomplished through the development of math and physics immersion programs, and in coordination with the existing educational and research infrastructure currently present at Stony Brook University, including the REU program.\r\n\r\nLeveraging advanced computational techniques and unique experimental facilities, this project aims to demonstrate deliberate control over the dynamic modifications of laser-plasma interactions with the goal of producing electron beams with the charge, energy spread, and emittance comparable to the state-of-the-art conventional accelerators. A Ti:Sapphire (\u03bb~1 \u03bcm) laser pulse will act as an ignitor to modify the plasma wave generated by an intense CO2 (\u03bb~10 \u03bcm) drive laser pulse. Controlled modification of this plasma wave is achieved by the spatiotemporal control of the ignitor pulse via a method known as the \u2018flying focus\u2019.  Electrons ionized by the ignitor pulse within the plasma wave will then be captured and form the accelerating beam. Because of the meticulous control over the properties of the ignitor pulse, the properties of the injected electrons can also be carefully controlled. Achieving the objective of this project will have significant impact on diverse areas of science and industry. As an enabling component for generating high-quality electron beams from compact, plasma-based accelerators, it enables application areas such as high energy physics, femtosecond radiation source development, as well as medicine.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
