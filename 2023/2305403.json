 "awd_abstract_narration": "Magnetic Particle Imaging is a non-invasive medical imaging technique similar to Magnetic Resonance Imaging that can be used to detect diseased tissues such as cancer in the human body. Successful development of Magnetic Particle Imaging requires effective, safe, and versatile nanoparticle tracer platforms. In this award, new tracers are being created by controlling the way small superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles organize into larger clusters using polymers that are created from natural amino acids. Cluster properties such as particle spacing and spatial arrangement are used to manipulate and maximize the tracer response for Magnetic Particle Imaging. This collaborative project will be conducted by investigators from the University of Rhode Island, the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and Brown University. This interdisciplinary and multi-institutional project is an excellent platform for engaging students and broadening participation, which will be achieved by partnering with National Science Foundation Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation programs in Rhode Island and Alabama. Students will be trained in technical, professional, and science communication skills.\r\n\r\nMagnetic Particle Imaging is an emerging medical diagnostic technique that exploits the unique magnetic properties and biocompatible nature of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles as \u2018tracers\u2019 for the generation of three-dimensional images of tissues. Two key challenges to facilitating research translation to clinical settings include preparing particle tracers for maximum exploitation of their superparamagnetic characteristics and their target-specific derivatization and utilizing biocompatible particle surface coatings and assembly agents to avoid adverse outcomes. This award involves a new approach to tracer design based on the controlled clustering of hydrophobic particles using poly(amino acid) corrals. Specific aims include designing and synthesizing poly(amino acids) with varying hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and stabilizing block domains; demonstrating controllable nanoparticle assembly as a function of poly(amino acid) composition; and evaluating the magnetic properties of the clusters using a custom magnetic particle spectrometer. The approach to Magnetic Particle Imaging tracer design is potentially transformative and expected to help advance Magnetic Particle Imaging as a tool for disease diagnosis and treatment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
