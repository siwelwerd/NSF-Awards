 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the complex processes that occur inside cells when reef-building corals are exposed to stressful conditions is essential to guiding future conservation efforts and engineering solutions for the survival of coral reefs. This project will focus on the relationship between corals and the microscopic algae living in their tissue, especially the accumulation and exchange of very reactive molecules (known as free-radicals) during periods of stress, which can have damaging effects on cells at high doses. The symbiosis between coral and algae is crucial for coral reef survival. As conditions in Earth\u2019s oceans change, this symbiosis becomes unstable, such that extreme conditions like marine heat waves lead to expulsion of algae from the coral tissue, turning corals white to the naked eye, a condition known as \"coral bleaching.\" This research will use a multidisciplinary approach--combining marine biology, molecular sciences, ecophysiology, physics, nanoengineering, and 3D fabrication--to explore how free-radical concentrations and dynamics within the complex coral-algae symbiosis may contribute to coral bleaching. The scientific training and outreach involved in this project will strive to engage with various groups to promoted integrative multidisciplinary STEM methodology and literacy for tackling complex contemporary challenges.\r\n\r\nMass coral bleaching events have increased in frequency and severity. However, the mechanism leading to the breakdown of symbiosis (dysbiosis) is still poorly characterized. The accumulation of free-radicals is understood to be a primary driver of dysbiosis. In this project, researchers will first study the cellular response in isolation and symbiosis of both the coral cells and the dinoflagellate algae cells to create a 3D physical biohybrid coral model. The model will be composed of a hard base mimicking the coral skeleton and bioink combined with coral and algae cells mimicking the coral tissue. This model will allow researchers to study the changes inside the cells and the bioink at high resolution under different conditions, including during stress levels associated with bleaching, according to cell type, cell density and tissue architecture. The characterization toolkit will consist of advanced microscopy, gene expression, metabolomics, nanoprobe measurements, material characterization, computational modeling, 3D printing and 3D bioprinting. Amongst the expected outcomes, researchers anticipate this project will profoundly transform our understanding of free-radical dynamics in symbiotic organisms in relation to the coral tissue microenvironment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
