 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information workers use digital collaboration tools for project management, preparing and sharing documents and presentations, and team communication and coordination. People who are blind or low vision are performing computer-based work at increasing rates, yet only 44% of the 8.1 million visually impaired Americans are employed. While advances in collaboration tools (e.g., shared document editors, video conferencing, and chat platforms) make it possible to work together in new ways and create new career opportunities, these tools remain largely inaccessible for blind workers. More than 2 billion people worldwide use collaboration tools on a monthly basis, yet learning to use them with a screen reader \u2013 software blind people use to read and navigate a graphical display \u2013 is extremely challenging. For example, collaborative writing tools offer only partial access for screen reader users, making it difficult to understand where other team members are working in a shared document. This project advances future AI-augmented collaboration tools and creates a more equitable and inclusive future of work by improving job-related skill development, increasing worker self-efficacy, and providing access to all aspects of teamwork experienced by current and future information workers. \r\n\r\nThis project is grounded in formative research and close partnership with four Disability Service Organizations across Orange County, CA and Chicago, IL that serve as the primary work contexts and both employ visually impaired information workers as well as offer training and placement programs. This research contributes: (1) foundational knowledge of accessibility needs for blind information workers through a taxonomy of accessibility barriers and provides design guidelines for AI-powered collaboration tools; (2) an accessible infrastructure of new interaction techniques and AI-augmented tools that support ability-diverse team communication, coordination, and knowledge sharing; (3) an open-source online community that fosters peer learning and support; (4) empirical evidence of system effectiveness for individual and collaborative interaction, skill development, self-efficacy, and collaboration readiness; and (5) a multidisciplinary consortium that will impact on industry products and policy related to the future of accessible work, AI, and equity in the tech industry. An integrated evaluation plan assesses individual and collaborative interaction with the systems as well as large-scale naturalistic use by blind workers and those seeking employment. To further ensure the project\u2019s broader impact, an advisory board includes experts from industry, disability law, and public policy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
