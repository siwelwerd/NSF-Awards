 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports travel to attend the 2023 NITRD/SEI Workshop on US Leadership in Software Engineering and AI Engineering, taking place in Alexandria, Virginia on June 20-21, 2023.  The workshop brings together government agencies, academia and industry to present and discuss ideas for accelerating progress on the Software Engineering of AI Systems. The workshop will be a forum to discuss national needs and R&D priorities in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering.  US competitiveness depends on learning/knowing how to build AI systems efficiently and productively and so that they perform their intended functions to meet requirements.\r\n\r\nAI systems present new challenges for building systems that are reliable, verifiable, producible and maintainable. Builders of AI systems will need to be able to design, build, sustain and evolve AI systems. Software Engineering researchers will need to develop new notions and capabilities in areas of verifications, testing, configuration, etc. The increasing prevalence of AI systems, and recent developments (such as ChatGPT) make it necessary to gain a deeper understanding of deep learning, large language models, and other technologies that are becoming embedded in everyday software-intensive systems.  A report will be written and made publicly available to disseminate the results of the workshop.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
