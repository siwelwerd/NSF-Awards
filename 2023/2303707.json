 "awd_abstract_narration": "Society faces many grand challenges, including environmental sustainability, water insecurity, climate change, and global poverty. These challenges demand system-level solutions that bring together multiple disciplines commensurate with rapid growth in the complexity of solutions and that reach beyond standard conditions and approaches. Extreme Design (XD) is an emerging field of design research that is, by its nature, focused on exceptional topics, from designing for extreme environments to designing systems of extremely high complexity. This award will support two conference workshops with interdisciplinary researchers from the US Northeast region to better define and advance academic research in this field. This award reflects NSF\u2019s mission to advance scientific progress and address issues affecting national welfare and security. \r\n\r\nThe workshops will include scholars from diverse disciplines, including engineering, design, economics, public policy, architecture, geoscience, management, psychology, physics, life sciences, and anthropology. The workshops will include panel discussions, facilitated breakout sessions, and the development of research concept papers. The workshop sessions will explore, define, and develop research opportunity spaces and related research questions for the emerging Extreme Design field. In addition to identifying compelling research questions, workshop participants will investigate and contextualize where gaps exist in current design tools, processes, and methods when addressing extreme design challenges. This workshop series will serve as a springboard for outreach on the topic of Extreme Design within and outside the engineering design and systems engineering (EDSE) communities, and will be used to stimulate further discussion and community building through follow-on academic conference sessions, journal special issues, and industry collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The main goals were to better define and conceptualize Extreme Design, develop pre-proposals, foster a community of scholars, and lay the groundwork for further discussion and outreach.</p>\n<p>We successfully organized two workshops. The first workshop was held in Boston on August 24-25, 2023, with approximately 50 attendees. The second workshop was held in March 2024 at MIT. The workshops included participants from various disciplines and institutions, including NASA, Northwestern University, Penn State, and more. This diverse participation ensured a broad range of perspectives and expertise. Through collaborative efforts, we developed a comprehensive definition of Extreme Design. Extreme Design (XD) responds to the inadequacies of conventional design approaches by developing specialized methodologies and technologies to address unique, infrequent, and highly complex challenges, underscoring the importance of creative and exceptional design solutions in tackling pressing societal issues.</p>\n<p>We identified and explored eight key themes within Extreme Design: solving extreme global challenges (e.g., climate change, poverty), design for extreme use cases (e.g., off-world living, deep-sea operations), design for extreme complexity (e.g., new systems engineering models), extreme design education (e.g., scalable design education methods), design for extreme resilience, sustainability, and well-being (e.g., sustainable food systems), extreme design technology (e.g., AI, new materials), design for extreme collaboration and knowledge creation (e.g., seamless human-machine communication), and extremely ethical design (e.g., AI ethics, barrier-free design).</p>\n<p>The project fostered a nascent community of scholars around Extreme Design. Participants engaged in deep, inclusive discussions and built valuable networking connections through workshops, webinars, and collaborative platforms like #Slack. The workshops facilitated interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together scholars from design, engineering, business, and other fields. This collaboration is expected to lead to multiple NSF proposal submissions and advance design research.</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of the project include significant educational and societal contributions. The project aimed to integrate Extreme Design into K-12 and higher education, promoting design inclusivity and equity. New education methods and models were explored to address the diverse needs of over 1 billion learners. By addressing extreme challenges and wicked problems, the project contributes to societal well-being. For example, designing for extreme populations and underserved communities can lead to inclusive products and services that promote diversity and equity.</p>\n<p>The project has laid the groundwork for future research and outreach. Planned activities include additional conference workshops at the International Conference of Engineering Design (ICED), publication in the <em>ASME Journal of Mechanical Design</em>, and continued community engagement through collaborative platforms. The NSF Extreme Design project has successfully initiated a multidisciplinary dialogue on addressing complex and extreme design challenges. By fostering a community of scholars and developing innovative design methodologies, the project has made significant strides in advancing the field of Extreme Design and its application to real-world problems. Lastly, this project initiated an NSF IUCRC planning grant proposal to develop a joint MIT-Northeastern Center for Extremely Advanced Design Technologies in collaboration with 20+ industry partners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/18/2024<br>\nModified by: Tucker&nbsp;J&nbsp;Marion</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2303707/2303707_10847715_1721324269032_XD1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2303707/2303707_10847715_1721324269032_XD1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Extreme Design Workshop Ideation Session\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2303707/2303707_10847715_1721324269032_XD1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Extreme Design Workshop Ideation Session\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Extreme Design Workshop report out of topic development.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tucker J Marion</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tucker&nbsp;J&nbsp;Marion\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Extreme Design Workshop Ideation Session</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2303707/2303707_10847715_1721324367401_XD2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2303707/2303707_10847715_1721324367401_XD2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Extreme Design Workshop Presentation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2303707/2303707_10847715_1721324367401_XD2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Extreme Design Workshop Presentation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Extreme Design Workshop revised topic report out and presentation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tucker J Marion</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tucker&nbsp;J&nbsp;Marion\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Extreme Design Workshop Presentation</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2303707/2303707_10847715_1721324480765_XD3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2303707/2303707_10847715_1721324480765_XD3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Extreme Design Lightning Pitch\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2303707/2303707_10847715_1721324480765_XD3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Extreme Design Lightning Pitch\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Extreme Design Workshop 1 Lighting Pitch presentation.
