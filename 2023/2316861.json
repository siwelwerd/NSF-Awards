 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIt is widely appreciated that nature has been perfecting its materials since the first plants and animals appeared on Earth. Thus, nature gives us inspiration for some of the best and most unique materials, such as gecko feet, shark skin, and lotus leaves. Biomimetic materials try to capitalize on these hundreds of millions of years of evolution by mimicking the structures of natural materials. Unfortunately, natural materials are often difficult or impossible to reproduce in our laboratories since each new biomaterial generally requires a new, tailored strategy to reproduce it as a man-made material. Such strategies, if exist, are often quite intricate, limiting the possible material compositions and making them difficult to scale up. A process for \"carbon copying\" natural materials would be a perfect solution. This project will study a process of mineralization of natural materials into metal oxides using chemistry. Such mineralization process can then be used for quick prototyping of biomimetic materials by converting samples of natural materials into metal oxide samples with the same structure but varied compositions. It can also be used to convert feedstock of biomass and biowaste from agricultural and forestry industries into new, value-added, materials for catalysis, energy storage and conversion, adsorption, sensing, and optical applications. The project also integrates a comprehensive plan for increasing participation of underrepresented groups in STEM and the numbers of leaders and role models from underrepresented groups in industry and academia. This plan combines high-school and community outreach activities with training and mentoring of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.\r\n\r\nPART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nNon-hydrolytic sol-gel (NHSG) mineralization demonstrated conversion of natural cellulosic materials into metal oxides with structure retention. However, we currently lack the understanding of how this process is completed for solid materials and if it can be applied to other natural materials. The overall objective of this research proposal is to understand the mechanism of NHSG mineralization of cellulose and its compatibility with other natural materials. The central hypothesis is that NHSG mineralization is compatible with other polysaccharides and oxygen-rich polymers if they can be swelled by the solvent and have an appropriate type and amount of oxygen groups. The rationale that underlines the proposed research is that the generated understanding will unlock a general strategy for converting natural materials into metal oxides with tailored composition. PI plans to achieve the overall objective by pursuing the following specific objectives: (1) elucidate mechanism of NHSG mineralization for cellulosic materials and (2) elucidate compatibility of NHSG mineralization with other polymeric materials. To complete Specific Objective #1, PI will use carefully designed cellulose materials to study the conversion process with cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy coupled with elemental mapping via energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Specific Objective #2 will be completed by testing common natural polymers with broad range of chemical and structural properties in NHSG mineralization to understand requirements for polymeric materials to achieve effective conversion. The project will also support training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. High school students will be hosted for an 8-week summer research project where they will conduct research and receive mentoring to empower them to continue into STEM education. Overall, the project will support participation of at least one woman, one underrepresented minority student, and two disadvantaged students in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
