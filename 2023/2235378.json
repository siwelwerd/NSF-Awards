 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving evidence-based teaching practices in undergraduate biology courses. This IUSE Engaged Student Learning: Level I project will examine how active learning strategies can support students\u2019 abilities to interpret primary scientific literature. Undergraduate students need meaningful teaching strategies aimed at improving understanding scientific literature.  This skill is important for future scientists and science students in general.  Thus, research on effective reading teaching strategies is needed. Hence, this project is significant because it will design and test four reading-to-learn activities for 1,000 students at three institutions: a public research university (Colorado State University), a private undergraduate college (Colorado College), and a two-year college (Hutchinson Community College, KS). This project is important because it is intended to improve students\u2019 scientific reading skills, as well as increase their confidence in using these new skills across other science courses. \r\n\r\nReading and writing are at the center of scientists\u2019 professional activities, yet students still struggle to interpret primary scientific literature. In addition, students tend to believe that their science reading abilities are higher than what assessments indicate. The proposed project will address the gap in the research on teaching scientific reasoning in biology classes through reading prompts designed to focus on parts of scientific arguments. We propose to test our instructional model in undergraduate biology (i.e., introductory biology, ecology, and evolution) courses at three types of institutions: a public research university (Colorado State University), a private undergraduate college (Colorado College), and a two-year college (Hutchinson Community College, KS). Reading-to-Reason-in-Science (RtRiS) interventions center on four types of prompts designed to highlight scientific processes and argumentation: (i) theory/ examples; (ii) hypotheses/ claims; (iii) inductive/ deductive reasoning; and (iv) graphical or visual evidence. The proposed project is organized around 3 objectives. First, the project team plans to develop, modify, and test RtRiS interventions in biology courses. Second, the project team will determine how engaging in RtRiS tasks affects student performance and their perceptions of which tasks increased their performance and confidence in each course. Third, the project team will examine how students transfer their RtRiS skills to a writing task designed to evaluate their understanding of constructing scientific arguments. Data collection and analysis include (1) pre and post survey data on student perceptions and confidence in reading and interpreting scientific literature and (2) thematic analysis of written summaries of scientific arguments by the end of each course. At least 1,000 undergraduates (500/year) will benefit from the RtRiS intervention. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
