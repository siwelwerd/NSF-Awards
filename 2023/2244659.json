 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over a one-year period, this planning grant will stage ten events across the state of South Dakota to mature a selected project concept and research team, using a collaborative, inclusive approach. The events include planning visits to partner universities and South Dakota state government agencies, planning meetings to develop priorities for the future five-year project, and workshops to engage potential participants. Initial strategic planning was held in conjunction with the South Dakota Biotechnology Association Summit, held in Brookings, South Dakota, October 2022.\r\n\r\nThis planning project from the South Dakota Board of Regents has the potential to develop the intrastate teamwork needed for a future EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-1 proposal on the general theme of the agricultural carbon cycle and how Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and precision agriculture can contribute to reducing agriculture\u2019s carbon footprint.  The agricultural carbon cycle topic is consistent with South Dakota\u2019s state Science & Technology plan, which identifies Agricultural Sustainability and Food Security as key areas for the state.  Agriculture is the principal source of greenhouse gas emissions in South Dakota, accounting for 46% of the state\u2019s gross greenhouse gas emissions. There is an urgent need to explore efficient solutions to effectively reduce agriculture\u2019s carbon footprint. The aim of this planning grant is to identify which of these challenges South Dakota researchers are ready to tackle and which can be accomplished within the future five-year project period.  The planning project\u2019s partner research universities include South Dakota State University, South Dakota School of Mines & Technology, the University of South Dakota, and Dakota State University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nSouth Dakota is a large, mostly rural state located in the upper Midwest with a population of ~900K. The state has six public universities, three tribal colleges, as well as private and faith-based institutions of higher education with a student enrollment totaling ~43K. With limited academic capacity, the state has traditionally trailed behind other states that have larger universities and student enrollment for science and technological research capacity. Thus, participation of South Dakota in the National Science Foundation (NSF) Established Program for Stimulating Competitive Research (EPSCoR) has been critical to build research and technological capacities.\n\n\nThis award funded the planning efforts of a proposal to the NSF EPSCoR Track-1 program for intended submission in Fall 2023. The states jurisdictional steering committee (JSC) conducted a preliminary screening process to select the topic of the proposal in Summer of 2022 and a series of meetings was conducted to refine the chosen topic and select faculty to lead this effort. In May 2023, NSF EPSCoR replaced the Track-1 program with the E-CORE RII and E-RISE RII programs. These new programs were designed to provide states with sufficient infrastructure support by increasing the number of scientific disciplines that could be simultaneously developed. While South Dakota was eligible to apply to the final round of Track-1 awards, the JSC elected to pivot toward the new E-CORE RII and E-RISE RII funding model. Thus, the nature of the underlying activities of this award shifted toward promoting these new opportunities. Numerous statewide meetings, both in-person and virtual, as well as funding to attend national EPSCoR or economic development meetings were held to accomplish this goal. This award also funded external advisors to potential principal investigators to ensure high quality proposals were prepared and submitted. To date, South Dakota has submitted five ECORE RII proposals, with one receiving funding (i.e. Black Hills State Univ.) and two currently under review. South Dakota has submitted four E-RISE RII proposals with one receiving funding (South Dakota State Univ.), and one currently under review. At least one E-CORE RII and one E-RISE RII are scheduled for submission in 2025. \t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/28/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KinchelCDoerner\n"
