 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of the 2023 IEEE ComSoc School Series Boston, USA Event on \u201c6G Communication and Wireless Technologies\u201d, June 5-9, 2023 is to educate participants on key findings and open problems in the field of 6G-enabling technologies. Lectures and activities will be led by an outstanding cohort of international cross-disciplinary experts from academy, industry, and government. The school program is expected to include talks, hands-on activities, demo sessions, industry career development opportunities, extramural visits, as well as student-centric competitions (i.e., best student poster award). The school is set to illustrate the state-of-the-art of 6G tech, and to open doors to technologies beyond 6G, still at an early stage of exploration, such as molecular communications and quantum networking. The school is to be held in June 2023 in Boston, USA, a city famous for its top academic institutions and a world-renowned hub for technology advancement and trailblazing innovation.\r\n\r\nThis award will support 20 students in the United States to attend 2023 IEEE ComSoc School Series Boston, which will be held in Boston, USA, on June 5-9, 2023. Attending such high-quality and internationally recognized educational event on 6G wireless systems is extremely valuable for future researchers and engineers. 6G is only some 5 years away, which, incidentally, is roughly the average time for completing a Ph.D. program in science and engineering. Students will not only be exposed to the state-of-the-art in the field, but they will also experience various interactive demo and lab sessions, present their own research results. The students will have the opportunity to interact with peers from institutions worldwide, meet with leading academic and industry researchers in the field, as well as take part in discussions that are likely to shape the future of the field. The travel grants will target senior undergraduate and graduate students who will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited travel funds. Priority will be given to underrepresented student groups in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
