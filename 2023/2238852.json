 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Nicholas Whiting and his group at Rowan University are studying small carbon-containing nanoparticles in order to broaden their application as chemical sensors. These \u201ccarbon dots\u201d are smaller than 10 nanometers in diameter and possess extraordinary properties that permit their use as light-emitting molecular \u201cbeacons.\u201d Carbon dots also possess an important, yet underutilized, characteristic that allows them to be detected using techniques that are analogous to medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The Whiting lab is leveraging these magnetic resonance properties to improve the synthesis and purification of carbon dots, as well as applying a specialized technique to temporarily boost their magnetic resonance (MR) signals by several orders of magnitude. These advances aim to diversify the types of systems that can be studied using carbon dots by enabling both fluorescence and magnetic resonance detection. In addition to increasing the recruitment and retention of female STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) majors from traditionally underrepresented populations, Dr. Whiting is also developing a new curriculum that provides hands-on learning about magnetic resonance techniques and guides students to effectively communicate science topics to the public.\r\n\r\nWhile carbon dots possess many advantageous optical characteristics, the underdeveloped utilization of their inherent 13C MR properties limits their potentially broad applicability. The Whiting group is addressing this shortcoming by synthesizing 13C enriched carbon dots, using NMR for particle structure determination, devising and evaluating sample purification techniques. Furthermore, they are using dynamic nuclear polarization to enhance the 13C NMR signals of carbon dots by several orders of magnitude, enabling high-sensitivity MR-based chemical sensing in real time. These approaches can then directly translate to other MR-active nanomaterials to grow a versatile network of cross-disciplinary applications. The research objectives are integrated into an educational plan that incorporates hands-on student engagement with magnetic resonance techniques in the classroom and guides students to effectively disseminate science topics to a lay audience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
