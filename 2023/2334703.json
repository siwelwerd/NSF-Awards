 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is organized as part of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Programming Languages (SIGPLAN) Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), which is the flagship conference in the field of programming language theory and one of the premier conferences in all of computer science. The conference is held in London, U.K., in 2024. This award supports students to attend the mentoring workshop in addition to the POPL conference and aims to broaden participation by students from underrepresented groups, giving priority to US citizens and permanent residents. The impact of the award relates to broadening participation in computing, providing opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading researchers, and building the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in all aspects of programming languages and systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
