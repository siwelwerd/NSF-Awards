 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to North Carolina State University, located in Raleigh, NC, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2024-2026. The focus of this program is to provide research and training in modeling the dynamics of biological systems using advanced quantitative imaging techniques under the mentorship of leaders in the field. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily persons from under-represented groups, disability status including the deaf/hard-of-hearing, and/or from schools with limited research opportunities will be trained in the program. This REU program will empower diverse undergraduates with skills in cutting-edge quantitative imaging techniques and data analysis to drive novel research addressing fundamental biological questions. Students will be supported to publish their research, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done through the online SALG URSSA tool. The NSF ETAP system will be used to register participants (https://www.nsfetap.gov/). Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nREU students will conduct research that will broaden the understanding of how complex cellular systems adapt to various stimuli ranging from organismal developmental biology, neurobiological function, down to the molecular level of how individual proteins interact with specific areas of DNA. Research will be conducted in departments including biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering. Students will work together to maintain a research website, collaborate with the Science House for K-12 STEM outreach training, and present their results at scientific conferences. Trainees will cultivate a community of practice through weekly cohort meetings on the responsible conduct of research; diversity, equity, and inclusion; career pathways; and scientific communication. Students will apply  through an online application form and will be recruited broadly using close-captioned video and guided application materials. Students will be selected by program staff in collaboration with potential research mentors. More information about the program is available at https://biotech.ncsu.edu/research-training/ or by contacting the PI (Dr. Stefanie Chen at slchen2@ncsu.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Melissa Srougi at mcsrougi@ncsu.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
