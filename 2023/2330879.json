 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support students from institutions of higher learning in the United States to participate to the 62nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), to be held in Singapore, December 13-15, 2023, along with pre-conference workshops to be held on December 12, 2023. The CDC has been for over fifty years the world\u2019s leading annual forum for scientific and engineering researchers who share an interest in systems and control theory, and in the foundations of automation technology. As in the past, the 62nd IEEE CDC will feature the presentation of contributed and invited papers, tutorial sessions, as well as plenary and semi-plenary sessions and workshops. The conference brings together academic and industrial researchers and students who share their latest research ideas and discuss needs for further development of the field in light of current and anticipated developments in applications and technology. The range of topics covered at the annual CDC is extremely broad, mirroring the varied research threads and applications of control and systems theory. The system-theoretic approach has played a critical role in the development of many contemporary infrastructures and technologies affecting everyday life. Today, for example, system and control-theoretic tools are central in the design, operation, and security of cyber-physical systems, where they can inform researchers about ways to operate large networks (e.g., power, communications, computer, transportation, and health-related networks).\r\n\r\nStudents receiving travel funds from this award to attend the CDC will have many opportunities to interact with members of the professional community in a stimulating setting, and to exchange ideas with a broad group of professional colleagues. The large number of workshops before the conference and the interactive format of many of the presentations will allow additional opportunities for training, learning and for gaining experience in presenting technical results at a major professional conference. Specific outreach efforts will be devoted to advertising the conference and the student travel award program to under-represented minorities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
