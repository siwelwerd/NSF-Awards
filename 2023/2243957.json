 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of William and Mary\u2019s Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences (VIMS) will host a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at the VIMS campus in Gloucester Pt., VA. The program will bring undergraduates to the VIMS campus each summer for three years.  The Summer Intern Program at VIMS introduces undergraduate students to the complex environmental issues facing coastal ocean and estuarine systems globally.  The major objectives of the intern program are to: (1) provide meaningful research and training opportunities for undergraduates in coastal marine science, and (2) increase the participation of under-represented groups in the ocean sciences. \r\n\r\nMentors are selected from the VIMS faculty and visiting scientists. The program provides internships in the areas of marine ecology, biological and chemical oceanography, biogeochemistry, geological and physical oceanography, and marine policy. Student participants are recruited from throughout the United States and include individuals from under-represented groups and from non-research colleges and universities. The research activities of enrolled interns often result in peer-reviewed publications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
