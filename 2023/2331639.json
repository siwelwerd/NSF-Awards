 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of first language (L1) acquisition \u2014 the process whereby children learn their native language(s) \u2014 occupies a central place in the science of human language. However, the Indigenous languages of the Americas are greatly under-represented in this area of science. Furthermore, most such languages are severely endangered, which amplifies the urgency for research on how these languages are acquired, for the benefit of developmental science and for Indigenous communities working to revitalize their traditional languages. This conference award supports an organized session at the 2024 annual meetings of two major scholarly organizations in linguistics: the Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas (SSILA) and the Linguistic Society of America (LSA). This organized session brings together two groups: (1) researchers focused on the L1 acquisition of the Indigenous languages of the Americas; and (2) practitioners working within language nests, which are early-childhood language revitalization programs that immerse young children in an Indigenous language. Creating a feedback loop between science and practice generates a wide range of broader impacts by strengthening the revitalization programs represented by participants and attendees, creating opportunities for Indigenous language revitalization practitioners to extend their networks and professional community, and broadening participation in STEM by Native Americans.\r\n\r\nThis organized session redresses existing geographical and typological biases within the existing landscape of L1 acquisition research by increasing the representation of the Indigenous languages of the Americas. In focusing on L1 acquisition, the papers within the session deepen the scientific understanding of specific Indigenous language structures, which have been of central importance to linguistic theory but studied only in adult language. By breaking down silos between acquisition researchers and practitioners, the session expands and enriches the research questions for L1 acquisition studies, better integrates Indigenous perspectives and ways of knowing into language science, and builds a body of more linguistically and culturally appropriate literature for practitioners and their language communities. Through creating positive impacts on language revitalization, the session also contributes to improving health and well-being within Indigenous communities. This award is made as part of a funding partnership between the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities for the NSF Dynamic Language Infrastructure \u2013 NEH Documenting Endangered Languages Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
