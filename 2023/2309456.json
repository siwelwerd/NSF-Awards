 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professors Csaba Csaki, Yuval Grossman, Thomas Hartman, Liam McAllister, and Maxim Perelstein at Cornell University.\r\n\r\nObservations of the cosmos, combined with terrestrial experiments in particle physics, have given physicists a glimpse of the fundamental laws that govern our universe.  The research supported by this award includes the study of mathematical and conceptual aspects of quantum mechanics and gravity, as well as the investigation of observable phenomena in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.  Professors Csaki, Grossman, and Perelstein will research the physical laws governing the known fundamental particles, as well as new hypothesized particles known as monopoles and axions, and will investigate possible explanations for the dark matter in the universe. Professor Hartman will study how quantum mechanics and gravity affect the properties of black holes. Professor McAllister will research possible signatures of quantum gravity in the observable universe. This work will impact the design and interpretation of new experiments.  Theoretical work in this area advances the national interest by strengthening the foundations on which other scientific progress can be built.  This research will also have significant broader impacts: the investigators will work closely with graduate students and postdocs, thereby contributing to training the next generation of physicists. The investigators will also give public lectures and colloquia to convey the results of their research to a broader audience, in the hope of inspiring a deeper appreciation of science in the community.\r\n\r\nMore technically, Professor Csaki will investigate the physics of magnetic monopoles using his novel method of pairwise helicity, study the phases of gauge theories, and examine cosmological solutions to the hierarchy problem and the cosmological constant problem. Professor Grossman will study flavor physics and investigate the neutrino force. Professor Hartman will study connections between entanglement and geometry in quantum gravity, and also develop new techniques to solve strongly interacting field theories with the conformal bootstrap. Professor McAllister will study four-dimensional solutions of string theory and characterize the physics of axions in string theory. Professor Perelstein will construct novel models of dark matter and study their experimental and observational signatures; develop strategies to search for new physics at the LHC and future colliders; and explore the potential of fixed-target experiments with beam dumps to search for dark photons, axion-like particles, and other new physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
