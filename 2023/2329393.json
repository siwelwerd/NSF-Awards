 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in computing have led to continually deeper integration between computers and human society. Yet as socio-technical systems have grown in complexity, their underlying computational models have become increasingly difficult for people to express, manipulate, and understand. For example, when users put data into a system, they may not be able to anticipate or control how their data will be used by other people or by software in the system. Similarly, when software developers create a new system that is designed to be secure, it is difficult for them to foresee all the ways that attackers will try to compromise that system. Such problems are complicated by the fact that a system's software often contains defects and that different users or agents might simultaneously take actions toward different goals. The research community has provided numerous methods, models, and tools to help users understand, create, and manipulate socio-technical systems. At an even deeper level, other research aims to develop new theories sufficient for understanding the complicated, unstable, and sometimes emergent behavior that results when large numbers of diverse, unpredictable humans are coupled to unreliable software.  \r\n\r\nThis award aims to advance knowledge and understanding of solutions to these problems by supporting the Graduate Consortium at this year's IEEE Conference on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC). VL/HCC is the premier international forum for research on the design, theory, application, and evaluation of computing technologies and programming languages that are easy for people to learn, use, and understand. The conference focuses on enabling more people to apply the tools of programming in a variety of domains, which makes it an important context to explore adaptable and customizable socio-technical systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
