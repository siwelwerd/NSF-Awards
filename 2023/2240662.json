With the theme &ldquo;Our Changing Planet&rdquo;, participants explored various perspectives and approaches to help answer the question, &ldquo;How can data from other planets beyond Earth help us better understand the planet we call home and how can a deeper understanding of planet Earth advance our knowledge of planets and the search for life in our solar system and elsewhere in the universe?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Promotional materials for the summit emphasized the antidisciplinary nature of the conference as an opportunity to forge unanticipated new connections and collaborations while envisioning challenges and projects that can only be tackled by working outside of conventional disciplinary structures. While some traditional conference elements were included in the Summit, such as a first-day agenda, prepared lightning talks, and a keynote panel discussion, elements of an &ldquo;unconference&rdquo; were also selected to provide a participant-driven, collaborative, and informal forum for individuals with common interests or goals to come together, share knowledge, and engage in discussions. Unconferences are designed to promote open and spontaneous interaction among attendees, fostering a sense of community and innovation.</p>\n<p>Day one of the Summit introduced participants to the unconference approach and opened wide-ranging discussions on convergence in science, data and education through presentations and a keynote panel. The day ended with a new installment of the very successful \"NEREID: Convergence On Tap\" series, designed to promote interdisciplinary dialogue and foster intellectual curiosity. The format of these sessions replicates the ambiance of a casual philosophical discussion in a pub, where participants can engage in open-ended debates or imaginative thought experiments while enjoying the convivial atmosphere. This &ldquo;Convergence On Tap&rdquo; activity focused on recently discovered exoplanets, encouraging attendees to think beyond the boundaries of their own expertise and into the broader realm of Earth-space and data sciences.</p>\n<p>On day two, participants shared their ideas for new sessions and gave a short &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; to explain their topic. Participants self-organized into breakout rooms and were encouraged to let their interest and engagement guide them in and out of any room or conversation. Many of these &ldquo;promising projects&rdquo; were further developed throughout the day and even beyond the Summit.</p>\n<p>An online, anonymous participant survey was distributed via email after the Summit. Results of the survey demonstrated alignment with the Summit's goals. In written comments, participants mentioned that they learned about the capacity for convergent thinking, indicating an increased understanding of convergence science. One hundred percent of survey respondents acknowledged that they formed new professional connections and/or collaborations outside their current professional networks that would not have been formed otherwise; All participants who were previously unaffiliated with NEREID have since become members. In addition, 80% of survey respondents were \"Very Likely\" to recommend the NEREID network to a friend or colleague, and the same percentage said they would attend another NEREID Summit.</p>\n<p>For more information on NEREID, please visit <a href=\"https://www.earthspacenetwork.org/\">https://www.earthspacenetwork.org/</a>.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/14/2023<br>\nModified by: Timothy&nbsp;Spuck</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2240662/2240662_10844558_1702590840545_Our_Changing_Planet_June_12___14__2023_Washington_D.C.__3_--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2240662/2240662_10844558_1702590840545_Our_Changing_Planet_June_12___14__2023_Washington_D.C.__3_--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Our Changing Planet Summit\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2240662/2240662_10844558_1702590840545_Our_Changing_Planet_June_12___14__2023_Washington_D.C.__3_--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Our Changing Planet Summit\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Promotional material for the NEREID \ufffdOur Changing Planet\ufffd Summit keynote panelists.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Becky Reid</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Timothy&nbsp;Spuck\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Our Changing Planet Summit</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2240662/2240662_10844558_1702591196629_PXL_20230614_143717908--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2240662/2240662_10844558_1702591196629_PXL_20230614_143717908--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Grantwriting for Future Projects\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2240662/2240662_10844558_1702591196629_PXL_20230614_143717908--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Grantwriting for Future Projects\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants engage in a session on grant writing to support future Summit-related projects.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tiffany Stone Wolbrecht</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Timothy&nbsp;Spuck\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Grantwriting for Future Projects</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2240662/2240662_10844558_1702590997901_PXL_20230613_134756685.MP--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2240662/2240662_10844558_1702590997901_PXL_20230613_134756685.MP--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Participants Plan Sessions\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2240662/2240662_10844558_1702590997901_PXL_20230613_134756685.MP--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Participants Plan Sessions\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summit participants use dry erase wall to plan morning breakout sessions.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tiffany Stone Wolbrecht</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Timothy&nbsp;Spuck\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Participants Plan Sessions</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
