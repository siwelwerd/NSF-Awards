 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal, \"NSF Accel-Net-Implementation: Harnessing Global Science Networks to Accelerate Cultures of Learning\" is to build an interdisciplinary global network-of-networks focusing on aspects of learning, development, and culture as they relate to global education needs. Our AccelNet represents an advance in methods for engaging in scalable convergence science, as well as how to harness global science to accelerate cultures of learning. We aim to leverage technology, social science, and data science advances to create collaborative resources designed to elevate the global science of learning and education. Typically, one describes engaging with communities of practice as outreach or translation, but in this instance the goal is to reach IN to the communities and let their needs broadly impact the direction of the network science. Our networks have broad reach, allowing cross-functional teams to be assembled that represent many countries, cultures, ethnicities, and demographics from around the globe. Through an active plan to promote diversity, inclusivity, and culturally sensitive learning and research opportunities, we will embark on training the next generation science, education, technology, and policy workforce; our intent is to transform global education by connecting networks with embedded architecture to inform science and amplify the intellectual capital of local community leadership for global impact.\r\n\r\nWe seek to implement a sustainable ecosystem of communication, synthesis, best-practices, research, and innovation for a network-of-networks designed to accelerate the global science of learning. We will evolve an interdisciplinary network-of-networks, including social science researchers, neuroscientists, psychologists, data scientists, engineers, designers, global development practitioners, philanthropists, educators, and policy makers in order to create cross-cutting infrastructure to tackle pressing challenges in the science of learning to meet the needs of global education. The network leverages resources from four existing networks: the Global Science of Learning for Education Network (GSoLEN), a network of scientists, policy experts, philanthropists, and practitioners all focused on learning and education, the Center for Applied Cognitive Science (CACS), a center specializing on applying cognitive science to relevant problems using culturally appropriate measures and approaches, an educational technology and innovation network, Mind Center for Educational Technology (MindCET), and a global development network, Global Communities. Our AccelNet specializes in global development, learning, education, cross-cultural training, equity, and policy. \r\n\r\nWe are a learning network-of-networks; learning is the central feature of education and attention to the well-being of learners on local terms promotes parity on global terms. Our AccelNet is designed to promote training of an intellectually agile, interdisciplinary group of scientific leaders, capable of engaging in scientific collaborations for societal good. Engagement with and mentoring of the next generation of scientists within the communities and within the networks will ultimately build a stronger way of doing science. We have selected self-regulation as our prototype research challenge for this AccelNet-Implementation proposal because it is consequential for educational, social, and economic outcomes, yet relatively little is known about the sources of variation underlying it, and how to intervene in contextually and culturally-sensitive ways through practice and policy to promote its development. Self-regulation, a topic relevant to all domains of learning and well-being, including the digital domains, requires large-scale mobilization and thus lends itself to the scale of a network-of-networks. We define self-regulation from the perspective of goal-directed behavior; an individuals' ability to override and manage impulsive actions through inhibiting or redirecting their behavior(s) (Hofmann, Schmeichel, & Baddeley, 2012; McClelland, & Cameron, 2012; Mora & Ozakinci 2013; Montroy et al., 2016). The developmental trajectory of self-regulation is, however, not linear or universal and varies broadly across cultures, countries, and demographics (McClelland & Cameron, 2012; Montroy et al., 2016; Wanless, et al., 2016), mandating synthesis of knowledge from global partners to promote shared understanding and benefit society\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
