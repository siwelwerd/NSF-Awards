 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of graduate students and early-career researchers in the fourth Midwest Machine Learning Symposium (MMLS), to be held in Chicago, Illinois, from May 16-17, 2023. The main objective of MMLS is to convene regional machine learning researchers for stimulating discussions and debates, to foster cross-institutional collaboration, and to showcase the collective talent of machine learning researchers at all career stages. The symposium will continue to enhance the visibility of machine learning research at Midwestern institutions. Furthermore, the focus on junior researchers, both at the student and junior faculty level, aid in the educational and professional development of this demographic group.\r\n\r\nThe format of the conference includes multiple plenary talks, invited sessions, contributed posters (with student poster awards), and panel discussions. The organizers strive to maintain a good balance of demographic and geographic diversity among invited speakers and co-organizers, and will also widely advertise the symposium to encourage diversity among participants. The website with details about the symposium is http://midwest-ml.org/2023/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
