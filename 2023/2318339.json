 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is supporting the early establishment of a Research Practice Partnership (RPP) focused on the preK-8 strand of CSforAll which focuses on designing, developing, and piloting instructional materials that integrate CS (computer science) and CT (computational thinking) into preK-8 classrooms. The RPP is comprised of (1) educational and agricultural technology companies, (2) researchers in the fields of agriculture, computer science, and education, and (3) district level leadership in the Granville and Jones County Public School Systems in North Carolina. The RPP is named the \"Rural North Carolina Computer Science + Agriculture Alliance.\" The Alliance will develop a curriculum for 4th thru 7th grade students that fuses CS and agriculture content together in a game-based learning platform that prepares students to succeed in future careers both in technology and agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe Rural North Carolina Computer Science + Agriculture Alliance brings together a unique mix of research and practitioner interests to collaborate on novel research projects while also creating several artifacts that aid in the integration of computer science materials into rural classrooms. The initial phase of the project formalizes a grounded theory of opportunities and pitfalls for computer science materials in rural classrooms. This in turn informs the design of Agricoding, a game-based learning platform that teaches 4th through 7th grade children about the basics of computer science, while tying the content to the agricultural industry that is a core pillar of rural communities. The system has students use block-based programming to control drones on a plot of farmland that complete various objectives tailored around sustainable agriculture practices aligned with earth science curriculum. The Alliance facilitates co-design of a set of professional development materials that enhance rural teachers' computer science education skills and facilitate the adoption of the game-based learning platform. The Rural North Carolina Computer Science + Agriculture Alliance is setting the stage for full development of a novel curriculum that prepares all students to succeed in the technology infused workplaces of the future and bring together diverse stakeholders in these distant locales to collaborate on solutions that foster prosperous communities across the region. This project is funded by the CS for All: Research and RPPs program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
