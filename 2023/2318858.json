This vision for the future encourages federal agencies such as NSF to take bold steps and experiment with new approaches for creating an ecosystem of partnerships and collaborations for use-inspired and translational research. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will convene a strategic set of corporate science and technology leaders, as well as NSF leadership representatives, to identify effective strategies as well as nontraditional approaches to enhance the next generation of public-private partnership models. Through co-investing in research, companies and federal agencies such as NSF can complement traditional R&D investments, leverage and expand available funding to achieve research goals, broaden engagement with new research partners, and fill the workforce pipeline. The workshop will take place in Spring 2023 in the Washington, DC, region and will be followed by a virtual event in June 2023 to broadly disseminate findings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
