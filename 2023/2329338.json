 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2023 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Nucleic Acids will be held on June 17th and 18th at the Grand Summit Hotel at Sunday River in Maine, USA. The GRS will be themed \u201cNucleic Acids: Mechanism meets Medicine\u201d and will occur just prior to the associated Gordon Research Conference on \u201cStructural, Functional and Mechanistic Behavior of DNA, RNA and Nucleic Acid Processing Enzymes\u201d. The GRS participants will be graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and other early career scientists. The two-day meeting will have three oral presentation sessions, two poster sessions, and one panel discussion on \u201ccareer pathways after PhD\u201d, which will offer the participants many opportunities to share science, network, and learn about various career development paths within and outside of academia. The GRS is organized and chaired by a postdoctoral fellow and will serve as an exemplary professional development activity. \r\n\r\nThe scientific exchanges at the GRS will cover both fundamental biology questions involving mechanisms of gene expression and regulation, and medically relevant subjects related to nucleic acid therapeutics. The oral presentations will include topics such as DNA replication and repair, mechanisms of transcription and translation, RNA structure and function, RNA processing, nucleic acid modifications, CRISPR technologies, and therapeutics. A dedicated session on method development in nucleic acid biology will bring participants up to date on new technologies and protocols, and how these can be adapted to solving their own research questions. GRS participants are encouraged to present unpublished and ongoing research work, helping push the frontiers of knowledge in the field of nucleic acid biology. In addition to being a platform for open exchange of bold ideas, the meeting will catalyze the participation of junior investigators from traditionally underrepresented communities. The meeting outcomes are expected to advance fundamental biological research and development of innovative solutions for critical global challenges, including healthcare, food security and climate change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
