 "awd_abstract_narration": "Andre Sanchez is awarded an NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (NSF MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and activities related to broaden participation by groups underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). This fellowship to Dr. Sanchez supports the research project entitled \u201cMPS-Ascend: Development of Catalytic, Asymmetric Ritter-Type Reactions of Racemic Precursors\u201d under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Eric Jacobsen.     \r\n\r\nThe proposal aims at the development of catalytic, asymmetric Ritter-type reactions from readily available racemic precursors using hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) catalysis to provide access to value-added chiral materials for small molecule-based drug discovery. The research plan outlines specific tactics that will enable the desired transformations through identification of a suitable HBD catalyst framework, capitalizing on a synergistic network of non-covalent interactions. A combination of mechanistic and computational investigations has the potential to provide insight into the critical non-covalent interactions and catalyst features necessary for enantioinduction. Scientific broader impacts include applications to drug discovery and development of new therapeutic technologies.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will serve as a teaching platform for the mentoring of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from underrepresented minority groups. The PI will serve as a committee member on departmental and campus-wide diversity initiatives. The PI will participate in professional networking and conference opportunities aimed at building an inclusive community and diversifying the professoriate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
