 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanobubbles are gas-filled cavities in liquids with diameters ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers. The key difference between nanobubbles and ordinary, larger bubbles is that larger bubbles rise rapidly to the surface of a liquid and burst, while nanobubbles can remain suspended in liquids for hours or even days. Due to their unique properties, nanobubbles are extremely useful in a broad range of technological applications such as froth flotation, wastewater treatment, detergent-free cleaning, and de-inking. The key process in these applications is the coalescence of nanobubbles on the surfaces of particles, which results in the formation of particle aggregates in a liquid. The main objective of this project is to use numerical simulations and theoretical models to understand the merging dynamics of nanobubbles and the resulting capillary force between adjoining particles. The education activities related to this project will attract high school students, especially those in underrepresented groups, in the central valley (California) to the engineering program, train students to conduct research in bubble dynamics, and guide students toward doctoral research programs in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis project will use molecular dynamics simulations coupled with continuum-based theoretical analysis to study the effects of bubble size, surface tension, contact angle, and surface topology on merging dynamics of nanobubbles and the resulting capillary force between particles coated with nanobubbles. The molecular level modeling will enable the study of microscopic details that are inaccessible to experiments and will provide a fundamental understanding and quantitative predictions of many key aspects of nanobubble dynamics and the nanobubble capillary force between particles. Moreover, such microscopic predictions are not hindered by many assumptions and approximations used in continuum and theoretical modeling. The modeling results will enable practitioners to develop strategies for enhancing the flotation rate of fine/ultrafine mineral particles and to improve removal rates of contaminants in processes such as wastewater treatment, surface cleaning, and recycling of paper.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

When the bubble size is less than 1 &micro;m, the buoyancy effect on bubbles is insignificant compared to Brownian motion. As a result, NBs can remain suspended in liquids for hours or even days. The highly stable NBs have a higher possibility than macrobubbles to attach to or nucleate on the hydrophobic surfaces of fine particles such as fats, oil, grease, and suspended solids in liquid. As fine/ultrafine particles approach as shown in Fig. 1, the NBs on the adjoining surfaces can merge and form a gas bridge, which results in an attractive capillary force. The attractive force brings the two surfaces into contact, and thus leads to aggregation of fine/ultrafine particles. The aggregated fine particles can be elevated to the surface of liquid by flotation processes. Therefore, NBs have a great potential in enhancing the flotation rate of fine/ultrafine mineral particles. With the similar mechanism, NBs can be also used in many other industrial applications such as wastewater treatment, detergent-free cleaning, and deinking to remove the hydrophobic contaminants (fats, oil, grease, and suspended solids) from the wastewater, clothes, and recycled paper. A fundamental understanding of merging dynamics of NBs and the resulting capillary force is essential for more efficient use of NBs in various industrial applications.</p>\r\n<p>With the NSF support, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with continuum-based theoretical analysis to study the merging dynamics of NBs and the resulting capillary force between two adjoining particles. From modeling results, we found the universal coalescence characteristics of NBs in various fluid systems. The modeling results were partially corroborated by experimental data in literature. Based on the research results, we published four journal papers, gave four oral presentations in international conferences and one poster presentation. In addition, we also built a NB generation system in Missouri S&amp;T. The new experimental setup will be used for both research and STEM education in Missouri S&amp;T.</p>\r\n<p>Using the NSF support, the PI trained three undergraduate students and two graduate students to use supercomputers to carry out large-scale simulations of NBs dynamics and built a NB generation system to study effects on NBs on various industrial and environmental applications.</p>\r\n<p>The key findings from this project include:</p>\r\n<p>(1) The axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equation gives the accurate prediction of coalescence dynamics of two equal-sized NBs. Due to the large Laplace pressure in NBs, the diameter ratio of a fully merged NB to its daughter NBs is sqrt(2), which is different from the diameter ratio cubic root (2) observed in millibubbles and microbubbles. (See Fig. 2 of the report) The sqrt(2) diameter ratio also explains the discrete distribution of NB sizes with a uniform increment factor of    &nbsp;found in recent experiment on characteristics of bulk NBs in water [Ma et al. J. Phys. Chem. B <strong>124</strong>, 5067 (2020)].</p>\r\n<p>(2) During the late time of coalescence of bulk NBs in water, the viscous stress in the surrounding water is multiple times of the inertial stress. However, the NB coalescence is still in a crossover dynamic regime where neither viscous stress nor inertial stress in the surrounding liquid dominates. To observe a clear transition into the viscous-dominated regime, the viscous stress in the surrounding liquid must be hundreds of times greater than the inertial stress and the Ohnesorge number should approach 10.</p>\r\n<p>(3) We integrated the ideal gas equation into the capillary force model and developed an improved capillary force model to make continuum predictions of the geometry of the NB capillary bridge (NBCF) and the resulting NBCF as a function of separation between two flat surfaces. The continuum predictions from the improved capillary force model are corroborated by the MD simulation results and are consistent with the existing experimental data on NBCFs between two solid surfaces.</p>\r\n<p>(4) The coalescence of NBs on two adjoining solid surfaces could result in aggregation of both hydrophobic surfaces and hydrophilic surfaces. For two smooth hydrophilic surfaces, the fully aggregated surfaces were found adhered to each other by a convex NB bridge. The equilibrium separation between two smooth hydrophilic surfaces can be accurately predicted by the improved capillary force model. The pinning of the contact line could occur at the bulge of rough surfaces. As the bulge on solid surfaces prevents further expansion of the NB bridge along the surface, the equilibrium separation between rough surfaces was found larger than those for corresponding smooth surfaces. (See Fig. 3)</p>\r\n<p>(5) Our thermodynamic analysis of the NB-induced aggregation process predicts that there is a critical contact angle below which the coalescence of surface NBs will result in detachment of the NB bridge instead of aggregation of surfaces. The theoretical prediction is corroborated by MD simulation results.
