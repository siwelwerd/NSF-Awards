 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 39th Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM 39) will be held on campus at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina from Thursday, March 9, 2023, until Saturday, March 11, 2023.  In its long history, SEAM has become a leading venue for mathematical analysis and its applications. SEAM is held annually at a university in the Southeastern US and attracts participants and speakers from throughout the United States and abroad. SEAM encourages the participation and professional development of early-career members of the analysis research community and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. Its mission includes facilitating the development of scientific collaborations and professional relationships between researchers at all career stages. The meeting website is hosted at http://www.math.clemson.edu/seam.\r\n\r\nSEAM is a major conference in analysis emphasizing current trends and significant developments in operator theory, complex analysis, harmonic analysis, and related fields, including operator algebras, control theory, and partial differential equations.  The meeting provides a forum for experienced researchers, early-career faculty, postdocs, and graduate students to discuss recent advances in the field, present their work, and develop new collaborations. The scientific program consists of plenary talks given by leading mathematicians at various career stages, and contributed talks open to all participants. As an annual event with a dedicated focus, SEAM is now a part of the mathematical research community infrastructure, enhancing research in mathematics and graduate education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
