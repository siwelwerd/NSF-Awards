ACM SIGCOMM 2023 will take place in New York City, United States, from September 10 to 14, 2023. This NSF grant will offer funds to partially cover the travel expenses to the conference for about 20 US-based scholars (students, postdocs, and young faculty early in their career with limited startup funds). It supports young scholars to attend the main conference as well as the associated poster/demo sessions, workshops, tutorials, and other activities at SIGCOMM 2023, expanding their research skills and intellectual horizons. It offers young scholars a chance to engage with senior researchers from both the academia and industry. Furthermore, since SIGCOMM has a strong focus on fostering interactions among networking researchers on a global scale, this award enables young scholars in the United States to connect with a vibrant international research community. The SIGCOMM 2023 travel grant chair is dedicated to ensuring the participation of women and under-represented minorities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
