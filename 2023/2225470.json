 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the frequency and scale of cyberattacks. Several high-profile breaches have affected government agencies, businesses, and individuals. This news, combined with the pervasive dependence on technology, has highlighted the critical need for cybersecurity professionals. Unfortunately, there continues to be an ever-widening gap between the number of available positions and the number of college graduates able to fill those positions. Recognizing these challenges, this project will focus on conducting faculty development workshops aimed at improving cybersecurity education for high school teachers. By empowering high school teachers with cybersecurity knowledge, educators will be equipped to inspire and guide students toward considering cybersecurity degrees and careers, fostering a new generation of cybersecurity professionals. \r\n\r\nThrough targeted faculty development workshops, this project will bridge the gap between high school education and college-level cybersecurity programs. It will develop a series of engaging and interactive workshops that cover fundamental cybersecurity concepts, current threats, best practices, and hands-on activities. Teachers will receive practical strategies and resources to incorporate cybersecurity topics into their existing lesson plans. By empowering teachers and fostering an environment of collaboration, the project will ensure that students receive early exposure to the importance of cybersecurity, igniting their interest and ultimately increasing the number of candidates pursuing cybersecurity degrees at the collegiate level. This initiative will contribute to strengthening our nation's cybersecurity workforce and protecting our digital future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
