 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching goal of the project is to advance understanding of atmospheric energetics and the vertical variation of energy dissipation near the surface. Understanding atmospheric energetics, especially the linkage between kinetic and thermal energy, is critical for comprehending extreme weather events under climate change. Scientists have tracked heat exchange at the surface, which is responsible for warming/cooling the soil beneath and the atmosphere above for over 80 years. With consideration of all possible heat sources and sinks, they have found that heat sources do not match all the heat usages by the soil and the atmosphere and that there is a missing link in the energy balance equation. Based on latest understanding of how heat is transferred, the principal investigator suggests a new theory for explaining the missing piece in the energy balance equation. Results from this study have the potential to improve theoretical understanding of how heat and air movements are connected, and thereby improve weather and climate models, and severe weather forecasts. As part of this project, the principal investigator will engage in education and outreach activities with student participants from a Hispanic-serving institution, local elementary schools, and public outreach events. \r\n\r\nThis award provides funding to investigate the impact of hydrostatic imbalance on energy transfer and validating the contribution of energy dissipation to the surface energy imbalance. The objective of the project is threefold: 1) to conduct a field experiment to directly observe the non-hydrostatic energy transfer and energy dissipation, 2) to investigate the hydrostatic imbalance in environmental energy partition between kinetic and thermal energy as well as energy dissipation as a function of height and atmospheric stability, and 3) to continue developing a simple  one dimensional model to validate theoretical understanding of atmospheric energetics as well as momentum and mass conservation in comparison to observations. Data collected from field observations will be used to measure how much energy from air motions is reduced due to surface friction to see whether the diurnal pattern of this energy dissipation matches the observed imbalance cycle. Results from the field study will be used in the development of the one-dimensional model and for improving understanding of total energy conservation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
