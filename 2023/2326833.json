A new focus on climate smart agriculture catalyzed by developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence will be needed to better manage complex agricultural cyber-physical systems to maintain productivity to ensure food security while constraining the impact that agriculture has on greenhouse gas emissions.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is to provide support for U.S. participation in a workshop on Internet of things (IoT)/artificial intelligence(AI)/machine learning (ML)-enabled precision agriculture to be hosted by Ben-Gurion University at Beer-Sheva in July 2023. The focus will be on big data acquisition and AI/ML-based analytics in precision agriculture. It will cover a wide range of topics focused on scoping of the key challenges remaining in how to use IoT/AI/ML to support further development of sustainable agriculture.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
