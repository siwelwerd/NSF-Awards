 "awd_abstract_narration": "The elaborate colors and mating behaviors exhibited by males in many species of birds and fish evolved as adaptations for female mate choice, however, comparatively little is known about female mate choice in mammals. This doctoral dissertation research project examines the evolutionary pressures underlying the role of female mate choice and its implications for male-male competition and reproductive success in a non-human primate. Through measurement and analysis of cues to potential mates \u2013 such as scent and color \u2013 the results of this project advance knowledge about the physiological and behavioral correlates of mate choice in primates. This project supports a female graduate student in laboratory and statistical training. As part of this project, she collaborates with a conservation organization to support the conservation of endangered primate species, and actively mentors high school and undergraduate students through programs which aim to provide research opportunities to underserved communities. \r\n\r\nMany primates live in multi-male multi-female groups in which both males and females mate with multiple partners (a polygynandrous mating system). In these mating systems, there are increased opportunities for males to compete over reproduction, and increased scope for females to exert mate choice. The study species displays a unique suite of phenotypic and behavioral traits that appear contrary to those predicted by sexual selection theory, presenting an interesting system in which to test existing evolutionary models regarding female mate choice and male-male competition. This project tests conceptual and theoretical models of the selective pressures underlying the role of female mate choice through two primary objectives: 1) characterization of aspects of male phenotypes (i.e., sexual coloration, chemical profiles of cutaneous glands, dominance rank); and 2) assessment the role of female mate choice by measuring the extent to which female preferences predict male reproductive success. This is achieved by combining behavioral data with innovative biological sampling techniques. In addition to the novel data generated for the study species, through deep interrogation of multiple components of mate choice in a primate this research provides valuable comparative information for the broader study of the evolution of mate choice in mammals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
