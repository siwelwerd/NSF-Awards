 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the high cost of proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. As the world transitions from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles, the market for fuel cells is expected to increase substantially. Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) have a number of advantages, such as high durability, long range, and fast refueling over battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Additionally, fuel cells are less susceptible to the supply chain issues that lithium-ion batteries are beginning to suffer from. However, FCEVs are currently at a significant disadvantage to BEVs in terms of cost. Reducing the cost of the fuel cell stack will help to make FCEVs cost competitive with BEVs and will accelerate their adoption into the marketplace.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to reduce the cost of PEM fuel cells by reducing the cost of the bipolar plate component. Bipolar plates currently account for approximately 30% of the full fuel cell stack cost. Current bipolar plates are made from either metal foils or molded carbon composites. Metal plates can be produced by high-speed, low-cost forming techniques, but must be made from expensive, corrosion resistant materials. Carbon bipolar plates are made from inexpensive precursors but are manufactured by processes which scale poorly. This project aims to demonstrate that a bipolar plate can be produced from a novel, low-cost, carbon-based sheet utilizing forming techniques analogous to those used for producing metallic bipolar plates. The effort focuses on optimizing the carbon sheet for low hydrogen permeability, demonstrating that flow channels can be stamped into the sheets, and quantifying functionality and durability by testing in small scale fuel cells.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The bipolar plate component of the fuel cell currently is currently produced from expensive metals, such as stainless steel or titanium, or from difficult to manufacture carbon composites and accounts for 30% of the fuel cell stack cost. The objective of this research was to demonstrate that a bipolar plate for a PEM fuel cell can be manufactured from novel low-cost sheets formed from expanded graphite and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), with the goal of producing a bipolar plate for less than the $3/kW target set by the Department of Energy (DOE). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirty-six iterations of the expanded graphite/HDPE sheets were produced and the materials were characterized for electrical conductivity, areal specific resistance, hydrogen permeation, flexural strength, and forming elongation. The measurements were compared to performance targets set by the DOE. As a result of the program, we were able to produce materials which exceeded the DOE targets for electrical conductivity, flexural strength, and forming elongation. Areal specific resistance was slightly higher the DOE target. The lowest value for hydrogen permeation at 80<sup>o</sup>C that we were able to achieve was 6.3 x 10<sup>-12</sup>cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>-Pa-s, which is higher than the DOE target by a factor of 100. We performed a cost analysis based on the bipolar plates produced during this research. For low volumes on pilot scale equipment, we estimate the current cost of the bipolar plates at $3.43/kW.
