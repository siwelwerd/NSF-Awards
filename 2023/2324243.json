 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel grant provides support to US-based graduate students to attend the IFIP NETWORKING 2023 conference in Barcelona, Spain from June 12 to June 15, 2023. The International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Networking 2023 Conference (NETWORKING 2023) is organized by the IFIP Technical Committee on Communication Systems (TC6). The primary objectives of the IFIP Networking conference are to engage members of the networking community from both academia and industry, to discuss recent advances in the fields of computer and communication networks, and to outline key issues, identify trends, and develop a vision for the future Internet. Attending the IFIP NETWORKING 2023 conference provides US-based graduate students the opportunity to discuss their research with an international community, meet other researchers from around the world, and ignite possible future international research collaborations. All of these opportunities are extremely valuable to developing researchers.\r\n\r\nFor many students, a travel grant is the only opportunity to obtain funding to attend the conference. This travel grant will be used to promote attendance by students who would otherwise not attend NETWORKING 2023. A portion of the travel grants will be reserved for first-time attendees who may not have papers at the conference, and for students from under-represented groups. The support from NSF is critical to strengthen US-based presence in the conference since it would increase the number of US-based graduate students whom can attend NETWORKING 2023, including those from under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
