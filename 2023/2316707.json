 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThis research, to be carried out at the University of Buffalo, is focused on societal aspects relevant to sustainability.  It involves development and study of advanced polymeric materials whose molecules can form networks that can be broken and reconstituted dynamically (\"dynamic covalent networks\").  They can potentially offer high performance on flue gas separation and the removal of hazardous chemicals (including both industrial pollutants and harmful biomolecules) from aqueous systems. If successful, the research activities can impact chemistry, materials, membrane science, and biomedical science. The research results of this project will be disseminated through publications and presentations. Research participation of underrepresented undergraduate students will be arranged through the SUNY LSAMP program. The project will incorporate multifaceted educational efforts including outreach to help promote science education in Buffalo\u2019s public schools which include many students from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nCyclodextrin (CD)-based polymers are promising materials for membrane separation and other applications. Dynamic covalent polymer networks have also attracted considerable interest due to their self-healing and other remarkable properties. The core hypothesis of this project is that CD-based dynamic covalent polymer networks can serve as novel membrane materials with self-healing properties and significant separation performance. Accordingly, dynamic covalent networks with building units of \u03b2-CD (a representative form of CD) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain linking with dynamic urethane bonds will be investigated in this project. The research objectives are:  1) to establish the synthetic approach to CD-PEG-based dynamic covalent networks, 2) to understand their structure-property relationships, and 3) to examine their applications for carbon dioxide (CO2) separation and removal of hazardous chemicals from aqueous phases. CD-PEG-methacrylate conjugates having dynamic urethane bonds will be prepared first and then photocured to give the CD-PEG-based dynamic covalent networks.  Characterization and studies of physiochemical, mechanical and self-healing properties of the networks will be performed. Finally, membranes of CD-PEG-based covalent dynamic networks will be prepared for studies on CO2/N2 separation and removal of perfluorooctanoic acid, cholesterol, and uric acid from aqueous phase.\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
