The primary broader impact of this grant would be to contribute to the scientific and professional development of young researchers working in various aspects of nucleation and aerosol research. Previous support of this type has supported awardees with high success and retention rates in these research fields.\r\n\r\nThis travel award aims to facilitate student and early career researcher participation in the 21st International Conference on Nucleation and Atmospheric Aerosols, one of the premiere regular (4-year) international meetings concerning of the formation, physical, chemical and biological properties, transformations and cloud impacts of atmospheric particles. This meeting offers a unique opportunity for young scientists to share research results with, and network with, an international cross-section of experts in their fields. The meeting will be held in Brisbane, Australia from 26 June 2023 to 30 June 2023 at the Science and Engineering Centre of the Queensland University of Technology (QUT).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
