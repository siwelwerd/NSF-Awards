 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on helping hospitals use data to increase efficiency in operating room resource management. The outcome of this work is a product that could deliver predictive management of surgical instruments; It has the potential to possibly deliver significant direct-to-margin savings to Operating Rooms (OR) at a time when hospitals are struggling to remain financially solvent. This effort may enable hospitals to achieve a 50% reduction in instruments, a 25% reduction in OR setup time, and a 33% reduction in tray weight. It could also reduce instrument-related delays and frustration in the ORs, making surgery safer and more efficient. The technology will establish the commercial viability of a new data stream, enabling applications in predictive OR scheduling, outcomes analysis, and surgical team education.\r\n\r\nThis project advances the field of healthcare analytics by capturing and applying a data stream that describes how surgery is performed. Every surgical instrument is specialized for a very specific task. This means each time an instrument is used by a surgeon, there is information about their goals, the state of the patient, and the phase of surgery. Under the proposed project, this information is captured by tracking instrument usage. This technology may facilitate a number of predictive tools that can be used to improve the efficiency of the OR and even inform surgical techniques. At a certain level, this application could enable quantification of how the best surgeons in the world deliver care, revealing insights that may not be widely known.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
