 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program in the Division of Chemistry, and co-funding from the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), the Chemical Structures, Dynamics, and Mechanisms \u2013 B (CSDM-B) program in the Chemistry Division, and the Biosensing Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET), Professors Julia Zhao and Diane Darland and their respective research groups at the University of North Dakota are devising a new approach to nanomaterial-based sensors, known as nanozymes, for the detection and quantitation of key metabolic biomolecules, such as glucose. They seek to create sensors usable in a range of environments and characterized by high sensitivity, easy synthesis, and good biocompatibility.  In conjunction with this work, Drs. Zhao and Darland are reaching out to engage tribal high schools and colleges as well as other universities in the North Dakota University System, to encourage students from groups underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) to consider science as a career option. Additional efforts are underway to develop hands-on advanced science lessons to help middle- and/or high-school students connect concepts from atoms to ecosystems with nanomaterials and cells. \r\n\r\nUnder this award, the collaborative Zhao/Darland team at the University of North Dakota will work to develop graphene- and polymer-based fluorescent nanozymes for sensitive detection of metabolic biomolecules. The nanozymes co-catalyze targeted biomolecular reactions while providing an intense fluorescence signal proportional to the analyte concentration. Targeted attributes include high stability in various operational environments, high detection sensitivity, easy synthesis, good biocompatibility, and applicability for detection of critical cellular energetic targets. In the course of these studies, the team seeks a better understanding of the geometric, compositional, dimensional, and electrochemical characteristics of graphene- and polymer-based nanozymes. Nanozymes will be tested for toxicity and used for biotarget detection and cell imaging. Cells that display high metabolic activity and that are vulnerable to metabolic distress will be used for testing the nanozymes under normal and distressed metabolic conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
