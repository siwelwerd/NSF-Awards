 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop titled \"EnviBayes Workshop on Complex Environmental Data\" will be held in Fort Collins, Colorado on September 18-20, 2023. Environmental and ecological data are often complex and diverse. This complexity may arise from intricate data-generating mechanisms, such as the presence of many interacting species in an ecological study, or from structural dependence, such as correlation in space and time of air pollution measurements.  As such, analysis of environmental and ecological datasets may require specialized statistical and computational tools to appropriately capture and account for the complexity. While the ecological and environmental statistics community is not large, it is easy to become siloed in each of the respective sub-communities. However, the advances in modeling approaches and tools for one type of dependence (and data) can often be usefully extended to another type of dependence and have a large impact on multiple application areas. It can therefore benefit statisticians working with different facets of environmental and ecological data to interact with each other to propagate knowledge among our sub-communities for the increased advancement of all disciplines. The workshop will have the following major aims: i) to provide sub-communities within environmental and ecological statistics with a venue to share cutting-edge advancements within their own networks to further spark deeper knowledge gains; ii) to transfer knowledge between sub-communities and foster collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe program of the EnviBayes Workshop on Complex Environmental Data includes: i) Environmental Health and Epidemiology; ii) Data from Remote Sensing; iii) Models for Spatial and Temporal Dependence; iv) Multivariate and Spatial Extremes; v) Using Climate Models to Project Future Extremes; vi) Models for Animal Movement and Abundance; vii) Statistical Inference Related to Complex Computer Models. This project will encourage the participation of graduate students, early-career researchers, and members of groups under-represented in statistics. More details about the workshop can be found at: https://statistics.colostate.edu/envibayes-workshop/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
