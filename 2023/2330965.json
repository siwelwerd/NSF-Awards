PETS addresses the design and realization of privacy services for the Internet and other data systems and communication networks. The 2023 edition of PETS is a hybrid event with a physical gathering held in Lausanne, Switzerland and a concurrent virtual event, from July 10\u201315, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe conference presents a valuable opportunity for researchers to share their results and learn about the state of the art in privacy research. It also offers Ph.D. and MS research students a unique platform to learn the recent advances in this area and encourages them to take new initiatives, form new collaborations, and produce additional results.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
