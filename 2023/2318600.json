 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a fundamental change in the way spacecraft propulsion can be achieved, perhaps leading to orders of magnitude faster space travel. Recent physics breakthroughs suggest that the development of an electromagnetically powered engine could enable high-speed travel under the right conditions. Commercially, there is great potential to decrease transit time to destinations on earth, to low-earth orbit, to the moon, and to destinations further in our solar system.  Success in developing this engine will initially be developed by improving satellite positioning and accessing orbits. Further scale up of this propulsion system could serve as a platform technology to enable increased access to space due to reduced need for chemical propellant and enhanced speeds.  \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project develops and tests a prototype engine by verifying the creation of electromagnetically driven propulsion. By utilizing a complex dielectric material as the environment where electromagnetic energy is introduced, the proof-of-concept engine will verify that the weak and strong force conditions are not violated and that a positive energy density can initiate nanoscopic distortions, to demonstrate novel electromagnetic propulsion in the form of further scalable engines.  A number of researchers have begun building upon the work of Albert Einstein\u2019s general relativity theory and now Miguel Alcubierre\u2019s metric that suggests that a vessel can be propelled by selective distortion. Two key goals are the development and implementation of the complex dielectric material, and the determinization of the radio frequency power required to achieve sufficient propulsion. The project approach will include: (a) mathematical modeling, (b) comprehensive simulations of different embodiments of the approach, (c) experimental verification of nanoscopic distortions using an established laser interferometry approach, and (d) design and testing of the prototype propulsion engine. Beyond the initial prototype, the next stages include an optimization of the power/distortion metrics, association of the distortion to thrust, and maximization of the thrust to weight ratio.  Ultimately, this research is expected to lead to enhanced electric propulsion that will be applicable initially to satellites, but ultimately, to a wide range of on earth and off planet propulsion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

First the experimental spacetime distortion project was to determine if a radio frequency driven chamber filled with the proper dielectric would distort, or warp spacetime, a baby-step toward faster-than-light travel. Second, we provide a comprehensive feasibility study into an interplanetary network, we call HyperSol, which would essentially establish an interplanetary railway system.\n\n\nExperimental Spacetime Distortion\n\n\nOur approach to experimental spacetime distortion (ESD) was to attempt to produce a warped space region (warp bubble) within a prescribed volume, utilizing a pulsed electromagnetic field as the energy source. In this way we create an environment wherein the shaping function consists of the field intensity with respect to the geometry, and the material wherein the field resides.\n\n\nMathematical Modeling and Analysis - In order to verify certain design concepts, it was necessary to model the physics and engineering in order to gain insight into the mechanical, electromagnetic, and thermodynamic effects.\n\n\nMatlab Simulations - Matlab was used to create simulations of the electric and magnetic fields within the chamber based upon the geometry, materials, estimated power input, and other factors that would inform our experiments.\n\n\nCOMSOL Simulations - COMSOL is a finite element based multi-physics system capable of simulating various physics based processes. The energy distribution, the rf fields, the temperature gradients and effects, and even the impact of vibrational effects was simulated with this tool.\n\n\nExperimentation and Analysis\n\n\nThe test plan incorporated a pulsed rf driven resonant cavity filled with a complex dielectric material. An interferometer was used to measure variations to a laser beam on the order of the wavelength of the light (532 nm). Within this experiment different resonant chamber geometries and rf modes were explored to see which has the greatest impact.\n\n\nExperiment Results\n\n\nOn March 11, 2024 an observation of some movement was made when the source was set at 10-W, 2.45 GHz, at a pulse rate of 1 pulse per second. The error between each frame was measured. The rf source we acquired was not able to go beyond 10-W of power. At the time of this report we are seeking a new source and redesigning the experiment to accommodate the source limitations as well as to take advantage of new insights we derived from our experiment and its analysis.\n\n\nThe HyperSol Interplanetary Network\n\n\nThis feasibility study employs a comprehensive and multi-faceted methodology to ensure a thorough analysis of the potential for human activities in the inner Solar System, referenced against the Mars Habitation Framework as a milestone guide. Both those initiatives critical to support of the Mars Habitation Framework, as well as elegant and natural technological offshoots from such space activities are defined within this Study.\n\n\nHyperSolTM Flagship programs:\n\n\nA.
