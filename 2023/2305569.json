 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at San Antonio\u2019s (UTSA) ADVANCE Adaptation project is designed to improve the workplace culture and climate for STEM faculty at a newly minted research one university. This project is informed by an institutional self-assessment that identified opportunities to enhance the institution\u2019s ability to recruit highly qualified STEM faculty to UTSA and to ensure that they are retained and thrive professionally and personally. The project aims to integrate essential change components into a comprehensive institutional strategy that aligns data management, practice, and leadership to effect systemic change. The project will implement a faculty mentoring program to foster a culture of mentoring that supports faculty at all points in their professional career. In addition, the project will support policy reviews and revisions and provide training to key stakeholders. These initiatives are evidence-based and informed by the relevant research literature and/or adapted from other ADVANCE institutions.\r\n\r\nThe UTSA ADVANCE project will create a university level and college level Local Change Teams that will be empowered to drive evidenced-based systemic changes such as mentoring and policy review and revision including accountability protocols. This project aims to develop and implement a range of coordinated initiatives in pursuit of systemic institutional changes. The project has support from institutional leadership, includes plans for monitoring the effectiveness of the strategies implemented, and is designed to be sustainable. It is anticipated that the lessons learned from the project will inform other Hispanic-serving institutions and minority-serving institutions around the nation in designing strategies to support equity for STEM faculty. This work is expected to build an institutional culture of equity and improved practices that will benefit all faculty and students at UTSA.\r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.  ADVANCE \"Adaptation\" awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based strategies to academic, non-profit institutions of higher education as well as non-academic, non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
