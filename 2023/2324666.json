 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the need for greater Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) participation in federally funded research.  Increased external funding not only benefits the HBCUs and MSIs, but the local community and society as well.  Grant-funded research initiatives contribute to the needs of our communities, and the broader society in such areas as: education, health care, technology, homeland security, social wellbeing, workforce development, agricultural sustainment, and numerous other areas. The project furthers the mission of NSF, identifying transformative ideas and accessible models that can be used to broaden and diversify participation in research activities, strengthening the Nation\u2019s research enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to create a strategic plan to increase research capability and funding capacity at HBCU and MSI institutions. The innovations, explorations, and advancement of knowledge enabled by increased external funding at the participating institutions will be a byproduct of this initiative. Southern University and A&M College (SUBR), the National Sponsored Programs Administrators Alliance (NSPAA) of HBCUs. Inc. and partnering institutions: Southern University at New Orleans, Southern University at Shreveport, Grambling State University, Dillard University and Xavier University, will join in this common effort to identify barriers, share best practices, and find solutions that will significantly impact the research capability and funding capacity of the HBCUs participating in this project. The project includes one, in-person, interactive conference and two (2) virtual workshops (one pre-conference and one post-conference). Activities planned for these convenings are based on the identified needs of the universities surveyed and current research findings. Understanding the challenges and roadblocks that hinder and often prevent HBCUs and MSIs from competing for, and managing, federal grant awards and identifying measurable, sustainable solutions to these problems will significantly transform HBCU\u2019s and MSI\u2019s research potential.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
