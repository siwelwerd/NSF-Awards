 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to address the national need for highly qualified science teachers prepared to teach in high-need schools. The project is offering 40 scholarships to science and engineering graduates who will become certified science teachers in high-need schools in Virginia. The educational experience of Noyce scholars includes preparing them as Teacher-Leaders in integrating engineering design, language, and literacy in science instruction. Noyce scholars are being supported through mentoring and induction into the teaching profession. Expected outcomes are increased number of certified science teachers for high-need schools, increased knowledge and skills for engineering design, language, and literacy integration in science teaching among scholars, improved student learning, and enhanced partnership between the University of Virginia and partner school districts in science teacher preparation. The language and literacy-integrated science aspect of the project is to address the need for teachers to support English Learners in experiencing success in science. A science methods course will be redesigned guided by the Teaching English Learners Language and Literacy-Integrated Science (TELLIS) framework.\r\n\r\nThis project at the University of Virginia includes partnerships with Hampton City, Henrico, Greene, and Fluvanna school districts. The goal is to recruit and prepare 40 science teachers over 5 years. The objectives are to provide 40 scholarships to science and engineering graduates who will become certified science teachers, enhance the educational experience and increase retention of the scholars in the project and teaching profession, induct scholars into the teaching profession, and enhance partnership between University of Virginia and partner school districts. In addition to teacher education requirements, scholars are receiving instruction in integrating engineering design, language, and literacy in science teaching. The intellectual merit of the project lies in generating knowledge on (a) recruitment, preparation, and retention of scholars in the teaching profession, and (b) developing scholars\u2019 pedagogical knowledge for engineering design, language, and literacy-integrated science instruction, and analyzing its impact on student learning. Broader impacts are increased number of certified science teachers in high-need schools and improved student science learning. The evaluation is studying these main questions: To what extent is the project addressing its goal and objectives? To what extent is scholars\u2019 pedagogical knowledge for engineering design, language, and literacy-integrated science teaching enhancing student learning in science? Data is being collected through pre- and post-tests, surveys, interviews, artifacts, and lesson observations. It is expected that project outcomes will be disseminated through presentations at research and teachers\u2019 conferences, and publications in peer-reviewed journals. The project outcomes are intended to lead to programmatic changes in science teacher education. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
