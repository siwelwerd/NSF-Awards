 "awd_abstract_narration": "Significant growth in the Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS) industry in the last five years has led to the need for skilled pilots, technicians, and analysts in this emerging field. The goal of this project at Harper College is to provide a gateway to emerging employment opportunities for students in using UAS technologies in the biological monitoring and resource management workforce domains in the Chicago metropolitan area and northern Illinois. The integration of UAS technology into these fields presents a novel opportunity to create a pipeline of Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) technicians with skills in drone operations and remote sensing. This project will strengthen Harper's capacity to serve the UAS workforce needs of the wider Chicago metropolitan area and beyond. The success of this project will open the door to expanding the infusion of UAS technology into STEM fields at Harper and surrounding high schools and community colleges that use UAS technology or remote sensing. \r\n\r\nThe overall educational aim of the project will be met by focusing on two principal goals that include (1) Enhancing UAS career readiness in biological monitoring and resource management by incorporating UAS knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA's) into existing courses and through experiential learning opportunities with industry partners, and (2) Preparing educators to integrate UAS in STEM courses through summer workshops and a community of practice model that promotes interdisciplinary collaboration and curriculum development. This project will serve as a model for other academic institutions interested in developing a comprehensive program aimed at addressing the shortage of well-qualified and skilled UAS technicians.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
