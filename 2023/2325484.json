 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dillard University, and HBCU in New Orleans, is uniquely poised to engage in a place-based approach to understand and train pre-college students in key regional geoscience environmental challenges. The Pre-Freshman Earth Science Summer program will be a foundational and hands-on experience in this exciting category of geoscience education. The idea is that students will become geospatial scientists for the summer. Students will be exposed to experienced role models, and as a centerpiece activity, will explore applications of drone technology to the geosciences within their community. The primary goal is to expose, motivate, stimulate, and encourage thus increasing the number of students from structurally excluded groups receiving degrees, and pursuing a geosciences degree and entering the geoscience workforce.  In light of recent climate events, New Orleans is a model testbed to engage and interest students in growing, ongoing geoscience related environmental issues.  Utilizing the Gulf Coast as a backdrop, this project will center on experiential approaches to environmental teaching and research, infusing GIS mapping, geometry/calculus, earth science and drone analysis, to improve and advance undergraduate STEM education pathways into the geosciences. \r\n\r\nStudents who have graduated from high school in metropolitan New Orleans and the surrounding areas as well as students from out of state will be selected to participate in an 8-week Pre-Freshman Earth Science Summer Program. These students will engage in four courses with multiple hands-on activities embedded within each. A capstone or highlight of the program will be the Introduction to Drone Technology Course which will serve to integrate all course topics (GIS, geometry/calculus, earth science) within an interdisciplinary activity-based format. The proposed activities are designed to: 1) build students' interest and capacity to engage in a geoscience-focused STEM career pathways; 2) introduce drone technology and their relevance to understanding earth and geosciences; 3) motivate and increase the participation of students from structurally excluded groups who major in earth science/geoscience; and 4) empower students from diverse backgrounds with scientific knowledge and skills in the geosciences.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by NSF's Geoscience Opportunities for Leadership in Diversity Program (GOLD-EN), the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), which provides awards to strengthen STEM undergraduate education and research at HBCUs, and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Excellence in Research Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
