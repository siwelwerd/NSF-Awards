 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CBMS Conference: Mathematical Methods for Novel Metamaterials will be held at Auburn University in May 2024. The five-day conference will consist of a series of lectures and intensive discussions between the lecturers and the conference participants and also among the conference participants themselves. The conference will (i) present the state-of-the-art mathematical research in subwavelength metamaterials and the new development in material sciences for graduate students, postdoc and junior researchers from Applied Mathematics, Physics and Engineering; (ii) chart future directions and formulate open problems in this field; (iii) establish new collaborations across the boundaries of mathematics, physics and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe principal lecturer Professor Habib Ammari (ETH Z\u00fcrich), who is a world-leading expert in wave propagation phenomena in complex media and mathematical modeling in photonics and phononics, will deliver ten lectures and present a coherent mathematical theory for metamaterials consisting of subwavelength resonators in various settings and for time-modulated subwavelength metamaterials. In addition, five supporting lectures will be given by five other leading applied mathematicians and physicists in the field. The supporting lectures are complementary to the principal lectures by focusing on the following aspects of research in the field: (1) metamaterials and their fascinating phenomena observed in the lab; (2) computational algorithms for modeling the wave scattering in complex metamaterials; (3) pentamode metamaterials; (4) mathematical theory for topological photonic materials; (5) mathematical modeling for quantum optics in random media.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
