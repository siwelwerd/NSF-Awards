 "awd_abstract_narration": "Urban areas are increasingly identifying the recurring need for equitable and efficient delivery of electricity, internet connectivity, and other essential services. As climate change is exacerbating the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, evidence shows that historically marginalized communities have been disproportionately impacted. This Civic Innovation Challenge project pilots a Resilience, Education, and Advocacy Center for Hazard preparedness (REACH) hub using a design co-developed with the community and civic partners. The portable, solar-powered REACH hub provides pre- and post-disaster necessities and connectivity while offering hands-on learning during non-emergency times. With strategic placement in socioeconomically vulnerable areas, the hub is expected to improve disaster response and recovery in a more equitable way.\r\n\r\nThis REACH hub is based on partner agency and community feedback and technical considerations unique to Central Florida, with a focus on equity in all stages of the design process. It features a state-of-the-art hybrid DC-AC circuit that allows for efficient, flexible, and evolving operation of power generation and modular appliance assets. During non-emergency times, the educational curriculum at the hub includes interactive and immersive learning using virtual and augmented reality and incorporating advanced geospatial hazard and social vulnerability data. There are multiple emergency and non-emergency test-run demonstrations at community partner locations to improve operability and community-engaged research practices. An equity-centered, all-hazards approach coupled with machine learning techniques is applied to optimize the operation and deployment of the hub. The modular design enables scale-up or modification for meeting the need of other disaster-prone communities.\r\n\r\nThe CIVIC Innovation Challenge is a collaboration with Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Science Foundation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
