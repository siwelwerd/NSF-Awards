 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Miami requests funding for additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Walton Smith, a 96,\u2019 general purpose regional vessel operated by the University of Miami\u2019s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS) as part of the US Academic Research  Fleet (ARF).\r\n\r\nThe vessel conducts a substantial portion of her operations in the near shore waters of South Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, providing scientific information relevant to major environmental initiatives. The operations include oil spill monitoring, water management changes, municipal waste disposal, and storm water discharge among others which are deemed critical to the sustainable development of the South Florida and Gulf economy.  \r\n\r\nOceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n1)\tTurner Designs C3 Fluorometer (3 optic channels) \t$9,605\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n2)\t(2) WET Labs C-Star Transmissometer (CST-25-DR)\t$21,387\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n3)\tSea-Bird 9+ underwater unit repair & 911+ Upgrade\t$27,993\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n4)\t2) Sea-Bird ECO-FLNTU_RTD Fluorometer/Turbidity\t$17,485\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$76,470\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\u2003\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nSubstantial portions of oceanographic operations conducted aboard the University of Miamis Research Vessel F.G.Walton Smith (RVWS) occur in the near shore waters of South Florida, the Florida Keys and the Gulf of Mexico. These operations provide scientific information relevant to major environmental initiatives such as water management issues, municipal waste disposal, storm water discharge which are deemed critical to the sustainable development of the South Florida and Gulf Coast economy. Efficiently mapping the effects of nutrient dispersion and contaminants introduced into these waters is essential (fluorometer, vertical water column profiling sensors). Turbidity or water clarity is important in determining the depth of penetration of sunlight within a given body of water. Light penetration is especially important for submerged aquatic plants such as seagrasses. The seagrass conditions around the coast of Florida are a major concern. Increased level of turbidity can induce many changes to the composition of aquatic communities. The impacts of cruise ships coming in and out of ports around the coastline of Florida can also cause an impact on the turbidity levels in the seawater (turbidity, transmissometer and vertical water column profiling sensors). The instruments received from this proposal will help monitor and track these environmental conditions. The instruments can be made available on loan to other vessels in the Academic Research Fleet (ARF) when available and are in accordance with the criteria outlined by the National Science Foundations (NSF) Oceanographic Instrument Program.\n\n\nThe fluorometer, transmissometer, turbidity and vertical water column profiling instruments are critical in keeping with technological advances aboard RVWS. It meets the NSF intellectual merit criteria by addressing the current scientific mission requirements aboard RVWS. The instruments will better serve all oncoming scientists for the current calendar year, as well as future expeditions.\n\n\nSeveral programs funded by NSF and supportive agencies will benefit from the proposed instruments in the ship schedule such as global weather modeling, red tide studies and ocean circulation. These, among other current global issues, focus on the most impending oceanographic concerns today. Oceanographic research vessels provide a valuable service in the collection of scientific information, which increases our understanding of the sea. RVWS is an extremely capable vessel for its size. The University of Miami is continually improving the services that are offered to the scientific community aboard this unique vessel. RVWS provides many opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to participate in scientific cruises. Annually, at least four expeditions take place to inform and train undergraduate students in proper protocols and techniques for oceanographic observations as sea. Nearly every expedition reaches students at all levels of education, from K-12 as well as higher education, through outreach programs, internships and continuous support of educator participation in research cruises. When in port, the ship is also opened for tours to local high schools and to the public during various events at the University of Miamis Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric & Earth Science campus. The requested items enables the ship to improve the quality of data that it provides.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DonCucchiara\n"
