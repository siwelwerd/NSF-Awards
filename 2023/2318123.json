 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural reefs and their connected ecosystem play a vital role in sequestering carbon dioxide and in protecting coastal areas from climate change-induced extreme events, such as hurricanes, flooding, etc. Unfortunately, climate change-induced ocean acidification has damaged nearly 40% of the reefs and the dependent ecosystem. While artificial reefs with a wide range of materials have been constructed in the past few decades, the environmental impact and longevity of most of these materials remain concerning. To find a solution, this project will investigate the use of self-healing carbon-sequestering composite materials for artificial reef construction that will enable storage of carbon dioxide while also protecting coastal areas from rising seas and extreme floods. The successful completion of this project will benefit society by identifying a novel pathway to protect coastal communities from the immediate hazards of climate change and contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Additional benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training, including the mentoring of three graduate students at the University of Texas at Arlington, a graduate and undergraduate student at Texas A&M University-Kingsville, a graduate student at the University of Texas-Dallas, and a graduate student at Texas A&M University.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to establish a novel pathway to design living engineered reefs that will enhance coastal resilience, store carbon, and restore habitat. The research goals are to: (i) investigate the process-structure-property relation of the self-healing carbon-negative composites to attain maximum carbon sequestration capacity with superior longevity in seawater; (ii)  understand the interactions across carbon-negative composites, surface algal, and microbial biofilms to ensure the settlement and growth of calcareous organisms on engineered reefs; (iii) investigate wave-structure interactions of 3D-printed engineered reefs via laboratory experiments to identify the optimal shape and void ratios of the reefs that will enable adequate wave attenuation while also providing habitat to marine life; and (iv) perform coastal hydrodynamic modeling to identify the optimal geophysical setup for deployment (location, dimensions, orientation) at which the engineered reef structure would produce quantifiable flood reduction in response to compound hazards of inland hydrologic variations, storm surge, ground subsidence, and sea level rise. In addition to research, the project team will provide hands-on learning opportunities to high school students via workshops on the STEM topics involved in this project including carbon sequestration, 3D printing, marine biology, and coastal flood modeling. The project team will also engage underserved communities through multiple workshops in collaboration with the Nature Conservancy and the Texas Sea Grant.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
