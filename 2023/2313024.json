 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emerging applications are pushing the limits of high-performance computing. New hardware accelerators are being developed to handle particular workloads much more efficiently than can be achieved in software, but it is expensive to develop these hardware units and the software that connects to them. In fact, today the majority of hardware-development budgets go to the combination of finding and fixing hardware bugs and developing software support for the new hardware. This project studies how to improve that whole development process with end-to-end formal verification, where machine-checked mathematical proofs establish correct behavior for the whole hardware-software stack. The research team is specifically concerned with tensor computations, as appear in graphics and machine learning. The project's novelties are in extending the idea of end-to-end mechanized proof for the first time to cover hardware accelerators, specifically tensor processing units (TPU). The project's impacts are the potential for dramatic lowering of the costs of developing new hardware accelerators or iterating on their implementations over time, while providing strong mathematical correctness guarantees to applications, e.g., the tools to show that a machine-learning system protects user privacy, despite the use of complex performance optimizations.\r\n\r\nThree main levels of computing system are covered by the project, all with logical specifications and proofs that are to be composed into system-level theorems in the Coq proof assistant. The top level is a source programming language called Exo, which allows programmer-guided optimization of nested-loop programs, where appropriate use of accelerators is gradually introduced through rewrite rules. General optimization tactics, or reusable transformation procedures, are being developed alongside their proofs. The middle level is the Bedrock2 programming language, which is similar to the C language, with formal support for external functions that can be used to model hardware facilities. That mechanism is being extended to support modern accelerator interfaces, in contrast to the simpler, embedded-systems-oriented interfaces of past work. Finally, processors and accelerators are verified, requiring new developments in modular specification and proof of hardware.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
