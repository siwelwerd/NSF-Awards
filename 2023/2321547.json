The current invasive method for measuring intracranial pressure carries a high risk of complications and is not accessible to all patients. The proposed technology aims to provide a cost-effective and easily accessible alternative to the current method. This technology has the potential to improve patient outcomes by enabling early detection of elevated intracranial pressure, thereby allowing for early intervention. The project aims to identify the commercial viability of this technology and explore the potential markets and regulatory processes both domestically and abroad.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a non-invasive alternative to the current invasive method of measuring intracranial pressure. The proposed technology, based on near-infrared spectroscopy, has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling early detection of elevated intracranial pressure. This technology uses an optical sensor placed on the forehead of the patient. The project aims to clarify the beachhead market within neurocritical care centers and the attractiveness of markets and regulatory processes abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
