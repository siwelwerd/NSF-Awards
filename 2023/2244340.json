 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasing digitization of the economy and resulting growth of digital platforms like ride-hailing apps and energy trading platforms have dramatically altered how individuals, organizations and governments exchange and allocate resources. By 2025 it is estimated over $60 trillion per year (~30 percent of world revenue) will be mediated by digital platforms. These platforms have disrupted multiple industries, upended labor economics and practices, and fundamentally transformed resource management, asset allocation and market design. While digital platforms have democratized provision and access to services and products with low entry and transaction costs, the larger impact on society is not fully understood.  It is critical that the developers of new platform technologies no longer simply be trained as engineers and computer scientists, and that policy makers and regulators must understand the ecosystems around digital platforms. This National Science Foundation  Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Northeastern University, University of Houston, and Hampton University (two of three of which are minority-serving institutions), entitled Platforms for Exchange and Allocation of Resources (PEAR), will develop convergent, transdisciplinary training providing students with (1) the capacity to integrate applicable findings and theories in business, policy and social science into ethical engineering design and practice and vice versa, (2) the ability to succeed in emerging and dynamic work environments that are yet to be regulated, and (3) the understanding of how technological innovations create value for different stakeholders and impact society at large. This project anticipates training 80+ MS and PhD students, including 22 stipended fellows, from a range of doctoral programs at Northeastern University (NU) or University of Houston (UH), a new Master\u2019s in Engineering Entrepreneurship at Hampton University (HU) \u2013 the university\u2019s first engineering graduate degree \u2013 or one of the two new graduate certificate programs at NU or UH.  \r\n\r\nThe PEAR training model is guided by evidence-based best practices in teaching, mentoring and learning, with an emphasis on best practices for interdisciplinary learning and engagement of underrepresented populations. Through carefully curated coursework and experiences, structured mentoring and professional development, and stakeholder co-designed research opportunities, PEAR Fellows will be trained to understand and contribute to the future of digital platforms and their impact on equitable distribution of economic opportunities in society, sustainable consumption, fair access to goods and services, ethically informed technology design, and the re-shaping of labor and business practices. These professionals will be ready to define and contribute to the future of work at the human technology frontier and to harness the data revolution (two NSF Big Ideas) in multiple sectors such as energy, health, transportation, logistics, housing, computing, policy, and beyond. PEAR is a collaboration that combines each institution\u2019s strengths: NU\u2019s leadership in experiential learning, Hampton\u2019s in engineering entrepreneurship and teaching, and UH\u2019s engineering partnerships particularly in the energy sector \u2013 to develop three new graduate programs. Formal external evaluation will document outcomes to contribute to the body of knowledge on effective models for graduate education in convergent research areas such as digital platforms.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
