 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and commercialize a new type of steel rebar which resists corrosion but outperforms existing rebar and is cost competitive. The advanced steel rebar from this project will enable safer and longer lasting concrete infrastructure, requiring fewer repairs and replacements. This technology will provide increases in the lifetimes of concrete structures thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions while also supporting a number of clean energy technologies, such as offshore wind, hydroelectric, and nuclear power, all of which require long-lasting reinforced concrete. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a novel custom composition of stainless steel to serve as a protective outer cladding for low-cost carbon steel infrastructure.  Several technical challenges will be addressed including tailoring of the composition to be highly corrosion resistant in high chloride environments, maintaining a ferritic structure and mechanical compatibility with a carbon steel substrate, and developing a cold-spray compatible processing technique. This project promises to shift the paradigm in corrosion resistance of steel and concrete infrastructure, enabling a novel coating composition and method to integrate into existing steel mills. If successful, this technology will enable low-cost steel components to reach the lifetimes of stainless steel components at less than half the price, extending lifetimes of key infrastructure as much as 3-fold and avoiding massive public costs and carbon emissions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
