 "awd_abstract_narration": "The two-day conference supported by this proposal focuses on furthering diversity in the emerging transportation workforce. The workshop places emphasis on partnerships between 2-year community colleges (especially minority-serving institutions or MSIs), 4-year MSIs, and industry stakeholders from the transportation sector. By bringing together 2-year community colleges, MSIs, transportation industry leaders, and government, the workshop provides an opportunity for capacity building. It will allow for the exploration of model programs, case studies, research findings, data, and innovative expert insights. The convening also defines research questions and identifies potential sponsors for a possible larger NAS consensus study on gender and racial/ethnic equity in the transportation workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
