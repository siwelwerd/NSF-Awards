 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for US-based participants in the international conference \u201cAlgebraic and topological interplay of algebraic varieties\u201d to be held at the Jaca campus of the University of Zaragoza (Spain), during the period June 12-17, 2023. The event will bring together early-career and senior researchers as well as students. Along with research presentations intended to disseminate recent developments, it will also include introductory lectures in the form of mini-courses at a level accessible to graduate students. There will also be discussion and poster sessions, to better strengthen connections among the various research groups represented and to provide accessibility for early-career researchers and graduate students. Furthermore, videos of lectures, provided by the conference site, and a conference proceedings volume of refereed articles by lecturers and participants will aid in bringing the results of the conference to a large audience. \r\n\r\nThe scientific focus of the conference is on the topological study of complex algebraic and analytic varieties. The program includes the following main topics, each driven by recent and fundamental advances: (1) Topology of singularities and related fields; (2) Lipschitz geometry of singularities; (3) Monodromy groups, Mapping class groups; and (4) Zeta functions and the monodromy conjecture. The proposed topics intersect a broad range of research endeavors in fields ranging from pure mathematics to more applied areas, thus conference participants will reflect a broad cross-section of mathematical disciplines. In recent decades, the basic tools involved in the study of singularities have branched out into a myriad of mathematical territories, and it increasingly becomes important to provide an opportunity such as this conference for experts, as well as beginners, in the various related specializations to interact. For more details about the conference, please see: https://riemann.unizar.es/~jicogo/sonal/115AM/index.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
