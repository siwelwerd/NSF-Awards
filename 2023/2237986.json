 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute new knowledge on two aspects of participation in mathematics education. First, this research aims to understand how perceptions of race influence how teachers, future teachers, and researchers assess how bilingual children use their languages and movement to participate in mathematical activity. Second, it will explore ways to counter deficit views that influence teachers\u2019, preservice teachers\u2019, and researchers\u2019 perceptions of these multiple ways of participating as inferior to what is traditionally considered as meaningful participation. The project has the potential to improve bilingual children\u2019s wellbeing by helping teachers to develop mathematics classrooms where children can participate on their own terms. This project will also equip teachers and preservice teachers with the research capacity to potentially transform their own classrooms beyond the duration of the project. These transformations may encourage more bilingual children to pursue careers in mathematics-related fields in the future.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to answer the overarching research question: How can teachers and researchers affirm bilingual children\u2019s non-normative participation in mathematics classrooms? Using a participatory design research methodology, the project will bring together a raciolinguistic perspective and embodied cognition to: (1) elicit children\u2019s perspectives on participation, (2) co-design lessons with pre- and in-service teachers, and (3) co-analyze children\u2019s linguistic and embodied ways of participating in these lessons. The PI will collaborate with children and teachers in second, third, and fourth grade, including one classroom per grade level in two schools (six teachers and approximately 250 children). The contrasting racial and linguistic backgrounds of children in the two participating schools offer a unique opportunity to learn about the how children\u2019s linguistic and embodied participation is legitimized and delegitimized given their racialized and linguistic differences. Discourse analysis with a focus on translanguaging and qualitative social network analysis will highlight how students use linguistic and embodied participation to make mathematical meaning. Findings will support educators in affirming racially and linguistically diverse students\u2019 unique ways of participating. \r\n\r\nThis CAREER proposal is funded by The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12), which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
