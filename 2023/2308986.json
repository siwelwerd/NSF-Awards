 "awd_abstract_narration": "A century after Einstein predicted gravitational waves, the NSF Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), followed by the Virgo Observatory, ignited the era of gravitational-wave astronomy with the first direct observations of gravitational waves from merging black holes and the observation of a binary neutron star merger, prompting subsequent observations in every band of the electromagnetic spectrum\u2014a watershed event in the history of astronomy. Cosmic Explorer (CE), a concept for a next-generation gravitational-wave observatory in the United States, will push the reach of gravitational-wave astronomy to the edge of the observable universe, by using proven LIGO technology in a facility ten times larger than each LIGO observatory. CE will enable transformative discoveries across physics, astronomy, and cosmology, by observing black holes and neutron stars across cosmic time, probing the nature of the most extreme matter in the universe, and exploring questions in the nature of gravity and fundamental physics. This award supports research to identify and evaluate potential sites for CE, each necessarily substantially larger than LIGO\u2019s sites. CE will do this while working in mutually beneficial, culturally supported partnerships with Indigenous and other local communities.\r\n\r\nThis award supports the identification and evaluation of the most promising locations for CE observatories while developing protocols and best practices for large-scale projects to be in partnership with local and Indigenous communities. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and public data will be used to identify and vet locations and then establish partnerships through the Indigenous Partnership Program (IPP). At locations that are physically viable and where community permission is granted, an initial assessment will be conducted; this and continued community consultation will inform a down-selection of locations for in-depth reference assessment. CE has knowledge of and access to LIGO Hanford Observatory (LHO), where there are established protocols for partnering with local and Indigenous communities. The (broader) Department of Energy (DOE) Hanford area, on which LHO is located, will be the first location where the entire assessment process \u2014 from start to a thorough reference assessment \u2014 may be implemented. The combined location search and evaluation will constitute a prototype for the full approach, which can be used to continuously add promising CE locations in Phase 2 of conceptual design. These activities will implement an integrated, respectful framework for location evaluation, community consultation, and combined data- and community-driven understandings of facilities construction priorities. CE will enhance US scientific infrastructure, ensuring the US continues its leading role in gravitational-wave science while connecting science with society, especially in the context of Indigenous communities. These activities will create innovative, culturally supported pathways into STEM, support retention of members of historically excluded groups, prioritize the interests of Indigenous and local communities, and empower future leaders of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
