 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2023 Midwest Optimization Meeting will be organized and hosted by the University of Michigan in fall 2023 to provide a regional opportunity for graduate students and early career researchers in optimization to communicate new findings and learn about new advances in the field. Optimization and control theory are among the major branches of applied mathematics which have important applications in science and engineering. This biennial conference will continue the tradition of providing a both educational and exchange opportunities for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty to learn about the most recent advances and trends in optimization and control theory and their applications. \r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the 2023 Midwest Optimization Meeting are to communicate recent advances and identify and develop trends in optimization, convex analysis, variational analysis, and computational mathematics as well as in applications such as machine learning and control domains. The meeting will embrace both theory and diverse applications of the field, with an intention to enrich graduate students\u2019 perceptions of active research areas and open problems in optimization, as well as help to inform them of new future research directions and collaborations.  The conference is planned for two days with each day of the meeting consisting of plenary and contributed talks, engaging both leading experts as well as early career researchers. Details about the conference can be found on the conference website: https://emunix.emich.edu/~bwang/MOM2023/index.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
