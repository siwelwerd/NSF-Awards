 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to increase the competitiveness of the US in manufacturing high value parts for shops with high product variety, low volumes, large lead times, and large set up times.  The application addresses a need to find the optimal way of utilizing existing resources in order to maximize production rates. The proposed technology may provide an affordable and easy-to-use solution for target markets in aerospace and medical technologies industries.  The technology may also help strengthen the national defense of the United States by facilitating onshoring of defense manufacturing by making domestic producers more cost competitive.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves the development of a new technology that enables high value manufacturers in optimizing the flow of materials in their shops. For shops with high product variety, low volume, large lead times, and large set up times, there is a need to find the optimal way to utilize existing resources in order to maximize production rate. Most scheduling optimizers are unable to handle this problem reliably or affordably. The newly proposed methods, algorithms, and software may solve this challenge. The business model for delivering this software solution is designed for small and medium size businesses in terms of both cost and usability perspectives. The solution demonstrates double digit improvements in all Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as on-time delivery (OTD), inventory turns, and profitability. Phase II work will mature shop optimization software through demonstration in a real aerospace parts factory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
