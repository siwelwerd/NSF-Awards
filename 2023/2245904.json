 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given the importance of technology for U.S. innovation and economic advancement, there is a national imperative to grow and diversify the computing talent pool. Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) play a large role in cultivating inclusive learning environments for students from underrepresented groups through scholarship, service, and leadership. In this CUE Pathways project, a team of eight California community colleges will collaborate with the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) to examine and enhance the servingness aspect of MSIs. The team will study how to move from enrolling racially diverse students in computing to serving them in ways that more effectively increase persistence, graduation, and career placement outcomes. The project\u2019s research activities will focus specifically on the effects of transfer pathways across the two- and four-year institutions and assess the adoption of servingness activities and practices along the transfer continuum on students\u2019 graduation and career success.\r\n\r\nThis project is a collaboration created between computing programs at the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) and eight partnering California community colleges (Ca\u00f1ada College, City College of San Francisco, City College of San Mateo, De Anza College, Foothill College, Hartnell College, Mission College, and San Jose City College). The project has three primary aims: 1) adapt, refine, and implement a servingness framework to identify and remove institutional barriers for Transfer students in Computing, 2) improve servingness in Computing at UCSC by identifying strategies for adoption that support equitable persistence and graduation for Transfer students, and 3) assess the effectiveness of UCSC's adoption of a servingness framework, policies, and practices in advancing equity in graduation, graduate school, and career placement rates for transfer students in computing. The proposed servingness framework, as described by Lozano, Franco, and Subbian (2018), along with Garcia, N\u00fa\u00f1ez, and Sansone (2019), will substantially contribute to a growing body of evidence showing how policy, instruction, student support systems, and other culturally relevant praxis can increase student success in computing. Project activities will yield model action plans, a theory of action, and recommended appropriate, replicable, and scalable interventions for institutions facing similar computing persistence and success challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
