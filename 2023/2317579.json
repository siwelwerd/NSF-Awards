 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to assist industries reduce their downtime for scheduled, preventative maintenance.  Industries with high-value assets like manufacturing facilities, engines, satellites, reactors, etc., often incur significant expense due to a lack of usable insights into productivity optimization. The forecasting technology and the developments stemming from this project will have general applicability and enable the use of prescriptive prognostics (when and what to repair) in diverse markets. Additionally, the methods developed in the project for training deep learning systems on limited data would have broad application within the machine learning (ML) community. Frequently, projects are limited by access to and availability of data. The methods developed in this project could be applied to small sets of medical data or financial data, as they are entirely defined on time series variables and dynamics. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project has two main goals. First, to develop a technology that will enable full autonomy in the extraction of meaningful feature sets from raw sensor data. An autonomous feature selection procedure developed in this project will exploit the combination of powerful control-theoretic results with modern ML tools to discover non-obvious linear and nonlinear features. This solution will provide a physics-informed architecture, allowing users to incorporate available physics knowledge with that emerging from the data, configuring a robust, flexible, and autonomous feature extraction mechanism. Second, the team will construct a robust, multi-modal, sensor emulator to address data insufficiency in order to train the ML components. This opportunity is in response to the limited availability of data in manufacturing sector, especially time-series sensor data in operational systems. The sensor emulator will be formed via combinations of modern ML-based generative tools in a manner that exploits their proven effectiveness while being able to work with high-dimensional signals and small training datasets.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This leads to the loss of millions of dollars per day. Existing prognostic solutions have failed to effectively identify impending system failures in time, because they cannot generate timely and trustworthy forecasts of critical events that foreshadow system failure. This SBIR Phase I project performed by PointPro Inc. located in Columbus OH concerns prognostic digital twins tasked with the problem of forecasting a complex system's path to failure, e.g., a CNC milling machine. The physics of failure is invariably very complex and for machine learning (ML) models to adequately represent the underlying physics, the number of training data points must keep pace with the complexity of the ML model.&nbsp;&nbsp;which can be on the order of tens of thousands. However, in niche industrial scenarios like the one considered here, the availability of data is limited; on the order of a few hundred data points, at best. Notwithstanding the popular notion of big-data, there is a stark shortage of ground-truth data when examining a complex system's path to failure. In this project we developed and enhanced \"DAGGER\": a deep-learning platform that can robustly, efficiently and reliably augment available sensor data to help train complex data-based computational models for smart manufacturing. DAGGER captures specific evolutionary characteristics of system degradation, reliably predicting failure before it happens. This would allow operators to take corrective action in time, ultimately maximizing asset productivity.
