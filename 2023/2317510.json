 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a system to characterize soft materials mechanically. Mechanical characterization of ultra-soft materials on the meso-scale is critical for tissue engineering scaffolds, structural and packaging materials, foams and adhesives, detergents and cosmetics, paints, food additives, lubricants, and fuel additives. However, the current mechanical characterization technique for soft and ultra-soft materials relies heavily on tensile testing. The main limitations are 1) high standard deviation due to difficulty preparing uniform samples, 2) sample damage after testing, and 3) inability to measure viscous liquid materials. The unique advantage of this meso-indentation methodology is the ability to capture mechanical properties during indentation pull-on and pull-off events of ultra-soft materials. Another novelty of the presented testbed is the in-situ visualization of adhesion events through a light sensor. Therefore, this tool can improve processing time in manufacturing biomimetic cardiac patches, control the quality, and improve the functional safety for implantation by documenting successful tissue scaffolds in manufacturing. Beyond that, this tool also has potential applications in food production, automotive oil production, and aerospace industries.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on developing a system capable of accurate mechanical performance characterizations for soft and ultra-soft materials on the centimeter scale. It comprises an adaptor attached to the mechanical load frame actuator, an indenter probe holder, a polymer-based indenter probe, a sample holder disposed below the indenter probe and configured to hold the soft and ultra-soft material, and a light sensor. The unique advantages of this system include 1) the ability to capture adhesion forces and in-situ adhesion events, 2) the elastic modulus range that concerns this testing methodology ranges from 0.5 kPa to 40 MPa, and 3) adaptability to conventional tabletop mechanical frames. Beyond that, this proprietary method works for a wide range of biomimetic materials, such as solids, semi-solid, and liquid forms, with anisotropic and heterogeneous properties. For tissue engineering, the acquired data will provide critical benchmarking values and evaluate the feasibility of biomaterials or bio-constructs for tissue therapies. For example, it can effectively improve the quality of cardiac patches by guiding the compatibility of mechanical properties between native and artificial materials. It also limits complications, enhancing functional performances, improving maturation, and reducing cardiac patients' hospitalization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Prior to participating in the program, our team attended entrepreneurship training hosted by FIU Startup and the regional I-Corps program, where we acquired foundational knowledge of business models and customer interview techniques. During the national I-corps program, we investigated two distinct market segments, the biomedical industry and the construction industry, completing an initial validation of our business model. Through ~30 initial customer interviews, we identified a significant gap in the tissue engineering sector: a lack of standardized methods for determining the mechanical properties of soft tissues. This gap hampers the development of compatible artificial tissues. However, we also discovered that the existing products and the early-stage nature of the tissue engineering industry suggest a limited market size and slow growth potential. In response, we pivoted our focus to the construction industry, which presents a significantly larger market potential, estimated at approximately $80 billion. The value propositions of our product, such as reducing the need for rework, saving on raw material costs, minimizing testing errors, and shortening quality control testing time, align directly with the needs of key customer segments in the construction sector, including contractors, material testing engineers, and project managers. The feedback from more than 100 interviews through online meetings, phone calls, and 4 tradeshows/exhibitions highlighted a critical demand for accurate quality control testing in concrete construction. Despite this need, the industry has been slow to adopt new technologies, largely because this issue is not yet widely recognized as a major \"pain point.\" Consequently, further research and deeper market exploration are necessary to better define the beachhead market for our technology and to encourage industry adoption.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to conducting customer interviews, we have successfully published three project-related papers, contributing to the scientific literature and dissemination of our work.
