The individuals supported will attend the conference and present a poster or oral presentation. These junior researchers will benefit from the technical experience and professional networking in both formal and informal settings at the conference. Consideration in the selection process will be given to the inclusion of members of underrepresented groups, diversity of institutions that the students represent, and diversity of programs within cellular and molecular bioengineering. This opportunity will have societal and economic impact of the field of biomechanics, mechanobiology, biomaterials, tissue engineering, developmental bioengineering and disease modeling, and in developing the next generation of researchers and engineers from diverse backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThe Biomedical Engineering Society - Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering Conferences are a leading forum for bringing together diverse, interdisciplinary groups of researchers to discuss advances in highly focused symposia. In 2023, the conference will have approximately 180-200 attendees participating multiple technical thematic sessions that include the topics of cell state transitions, cell competition in development and diseases, transcriptional noise and cell states, links between biophysical and biochemical states, immune cell states, and new technologies and approaches for regenerative medicine. The opportunity to attend and present will broaden the participating researchers\u2019 technical understanding, stimulate the development of new ideas and research topics, and provide numerous professional development and networking opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This grant was used 1) for supporting students, postdoc fellows, and independent junior investigators (Rising Stars) whose submitted abstracts were selected for podium presentations on the basis of scientific merits, with a focus on promoting women and underrepresented minorities. For these selected students, postdoc fellows and independent junior investigators, this NSF grant was used to provide travel allowances / conference registration reimbursements, thus defraying some costs incurred to these junior researchers and reducing barriers to their participation; 2) for offsetting the cost of the &lsquo;Lunch with Leaders&rsquo; trainee event during the conference. This popular mentoring event brought together trainees, together with invited speakers. During this extended lunch, trainees / mentees engaged with leaders in the field by assigned, rotating seating, as well as the provision of key topics to seed discussion. The overall objective of this BMES-CMBE conference was to advance fundamental understanding of cell state transitions through research dissemination and foster interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers working in diverse fields. During this conference, this objective was accomplished through two approaches: 1) present research discoveries to a diverse engineering and biology audience through the invitation of speakers and award winners with expertise in studying cell state transitions, and 2) outline potential pathways to integrate results into generalizable, predictive frameworks and translate fundamental research in cell state transitions into novel products by connecting researchers with industry professionals. This conference thus provided a unique opportunity to bring investigators from diverse fields together in one room to exchange ideas and brainstorm new integrative strategies for pushing this field forward. The outcomes of the conference were achieved to increase research disseminations and collaborations amongst researchers, as well as a new vision and strategic plan for engineering biological systems for basic science, product development, and translation.

The intellectual goal of this conference was to catalyze 1) the development of new molecular, cellular, bioimaging, synthetic biology, and single-cell technologies for probing and manipulating cellular dynamics and function, 2) the application and transition of these cutting edge approaches for understanding the organizing principles of cell state transitions in complex multicellular systems and across scales, and 3) the translation of these advancements in ways that ultimately benefit humanity, such as actionable models of biological processes, drug screening systems, and cellular biosensors to sense and respond to environment cues. Within this central theme of the conference, we recruited several established and emerging research leaders in key defining research areas with strong focus on understanding cell states in development and diseases and their applications in cellular and molecular bioengineering. The conference program thus focused on how emerging technologies could be integrated for advancing understanding of cell state transitions and how these new technologies and understanding generated in this integrative area could be translated into improved biomedical and clinical practices.
