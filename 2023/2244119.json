 "awd_abstract_narration": "This new three-year REU project entitled REU Site in Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chain (AMSC)  at the University of Louisville will provide a 10-week summer experiential training for 8 undergraduate students each year. This site features research projects covering a broad spectrum of topics, all of which focus on matters of immediate and pressing issues in current and future manufacturing and supply chain. AMSC research is an evolving interdisciplinary domain at the intersection of engineering, business, and science. Today\u2019s manufacturing and supply chain rely on advanced technology and require intensive skills that include simulation, automation, and computing. These techniques provide a platform for students to study and analyze AMSC systems, and in turn, investigate new research opportunities in science, engineering, and technology to improve such systems. The goal is to foster the integration of research into undergraduate education based on project-specific activities within the AMSC domain and demonstrate to the REU students how research outcomes can be translated to real-world settings.\r\n\r\nThis new three-year REU project entitled REU Site in Advanced Manufacturing and Supply Chain (AMSC) at the University of Louisville will provide a 10-week summer experiential training. The AMSC REU site will host 8 students per year who will be recruited from minority-serving institutions and institutions with limited access to research facilities. The goal is to foster the integration of research into undergraduate education based on project-specific activities within the AMSC domain and demonstrate to the REU students how research outcomes can be translated to real-world settings. REU students will work closely with faculty mentors on cutting-edge research projects that are motivated from real world problems. The participants will work in state-of-the-art labs and research centers at the University and will also interact with post-doctoral students, graduate students, and industry advisors. The AMSC REU students will also participate in professional development opportunities such as workshops, training sessions, research presentations, and plant tours. Students will be exposed to high-quality, cutting-edge research and will develop greater awareness of career opportunities and be prepared for advanced studies in manufacturing and supply chain.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
