 "awd_abstract_narration": "Faculty at institutions with minimal or limited research infrastructure often find it difficult to maintain connections with the broader science community. This is particularly true for those at minority serving institutions such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and at primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs). NSF funds will be used to support activities designed to broaden participation of PUI and HBCU faculty and students at the annual Plant Biology (PB) 2023 conference sponsored and organized by American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB). Conference activities are designed to enhance their participation at the national meeting and to introduce these scientists to research resources and funding opportunities that will help them connect to the broader plant biology research community year-round. \r\n\r\nASPB is a leader in supporting career development opportunities for a wide variety of scientists. In an effort to boost research engagement at PUIs and HBCUs for current and prospective faculty, an extended workshop will be held at PB 2023 for current faculty to meet, share best practices in experimental design, collaboration, grant writing, and time management for conducting research. In addition, PUI and HBCU faculty and students will be provided with numerous networking and mentoring opportunities during the conference and throughout the year. NSF funds will be used to provide travel awards to PUI and HBCU scientists and students to attend and actively participate in activities at the PB 2023 conference to be held from August 5-10, 2023, in Savannah (GA).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
