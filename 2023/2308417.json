 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports U.S. participation in the conference \u201cHarmonic and Complex Analysis: Modern and Classical\u201d to be held June 18-22, 2023 at Bar Ilan University, Israel. The conference is jointly organized by researchers from Bar-Ilan University, Holon Institute of Technology, ORT Braude College, Tel Aviv University, and the University of South Florida. Presentations at the conference range from plenary lectures describing recent breakthrough results in complex and harmonic analysis in a form accessible to advanced graduate students and young researchers, to more specialized talks on focused research topics. The award supports the travel of early-career researchers and graduate students from U.S. institutions. Participation of beginning researchers in this international conference will benefit the U.S. research community by fostering new collaborations and the exchange of research ideas between U.S.-based researchers working in harmonic and complex analysis and their counterparts across the globe.\r\n\r\nThe conference focuses on a suite of currently emerging themes at the borderline between mathematics and physics. Areas of research of the plenary speakers include (1) localization of eigenmodes of elliptic operators, which unites deep results in geometric measure theory and harmonic analysis with modern applications to quantum physics, noise abatement walls, LEDs, and optical devices; (2) harmonic analysis with applications to medical imaging; (3) stochastic algebraic geometry and gravitational lensing; (4) classical harmonic analysis with applications to probability theory; and (5) classical complex analysis and function theory, with new lines of attack on well-known problems in mathematical physics, such as Hele-Shaw flows, Laplacian growth, and the study of Coulomb gases. Further information can be found at https://hca2023.math.biu.ac.il .\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
