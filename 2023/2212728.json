 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a novel external system for rapidly diagnosing sepsis by measuring capillary refill time (CRT). Independent clinical studies have demonstrated the utility of CRT for detecting sepsis. Current methods for monitoring capillary refill times rely on physical examinations that are both prone to human error and inconsistency. The company aims to develop an automated diagnostic and monitoring device for objectively and repeatably quantifying capillary refill time for use in a clinical setting. If successful, the technology may have widespread potential use in emergency departments, clinics, ambulances, or at home.\r\n \r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project develops a new finger-sensor interface for monitoring CRT that ensures contact between the finger and sensor across a range of finger sizes and validate the system in human use. The objectives are to ensure human factors engineering to enable use in a broad range of patients by a wide range of caregivers. A novel algorithm to improve sensor performance and provide user feedback on noise or aberrant signals will also be integrated. The system will be tested in a group of patients at risk for sepsis to demonstrate the device reliably and accurately measures the CRT across a wide variety of patient demographics and the device is easily usable by a wide range of caregivers including physicians and family members without extensive training. A successful Phase I outcome is a system enabling the consistent ability to collect high-quality measures of CRT in patients at risk for sepsis and to provide the user with ongoing measures of signal quality.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
