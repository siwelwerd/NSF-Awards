 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop affordable and efficient new chemical processes for the conversion of natural gas to alcohols, which will reduce the emissions of methane and help mitigate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.  The affordable capture and conversion of methane emissions to alcohols is expected to have environmental benefit and provide a commercially valuable market that can be developed for remote areas where flaring and venting of methane occurs.  The direct release or flaring of methane results in greenhouse gas emissions. The conversion of as little as 10% of the currently-flared methane emissions can satisfy the global methanol demand which is an estimated $55 billion/year industry. A recent Global Methane Assessment showed that human-caused methane emissions can be reduced by close to 45% in this decade. This project will have an impact in areas where the highest methane emissions occur, such as oil and gas producing regions.   \r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I Project develops a high-risk technology based on modular reactors that utilize novel electrodes and cell architecture to directly capture and convert methane to alcohols and hydrogen.  Using newly developed methods, the project will demonstrate the feasibility of affordably converting methane to value-added fuels at atmospheric pressure and low temperatures in the field. The proposed technology focuses on the application of process intensification at modular-equipment scales suitable for deployment and transport between remote locations where gas is being vented or flared. The modular reactors are compact, integrated, and transportable. They have a large turndown ratio and can operate continuously under varying feed rates and gas compositions. These reactors have the potential to convert a high fraction of methane, lessening the requirements for outgassing capture. This project will use advanced additive manufacturing, electrochemical modeling, gas sensing, and process scale up.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
