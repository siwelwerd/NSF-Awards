 "awd_abstract_narration": "The US Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that Florida has the second highest employment level in the Avionics industry of the 50 states and is in the highest growth category for the industry. FAA\u2019s reports show Broward College\u2019s service area in the highest growth category for Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with new device registrations. This project will increase access for underrepresented populations to Avionics careers by engaging students in informal avionics encounters and creating a new track in the Avionics AS degree program focused on drone maintenance. The informal introduction to avionics begins the pathway of stackable credentials including regulatory licensure, stackable credentials, AS degrees, and BS degrees. The project will add to the body of knowledge in effective pedagogy in avionics education resulting in increased credential attainment. Utilizing experiential learning methods, students will demonstrate competencies leading to stackable credentials. The effort ultimately benefits students by increasing enrollment, retention, and credential acquisition in avionics pathways.\r\n\r\nThe project activities, which are based on previous promising efforts at the College, will increase depth of learning and understanding of career skills in Avionics. These activities include: 1) Conducting an experiential learning after school program and a summer boot camp; 2) Developing curriculum and establishing a 9-credit drone maintenance track in the AS Avionics degree program; 3) Establishing a firm foundation through partnerships at the secondary, community college, university, community, and professional levels; 4) Implementing outreach efforts that tap underserved and non- traditional populations; and 5) Evaluating and disseminating project results, processes, and materials. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
