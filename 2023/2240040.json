 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports research in general-purpose robotic manipulation in unstructured environments. Most real-world manipulation tasks involve uncertainties, un-modellable physics, and unknown parameters, where traditional approaches for precise planning and control have been hitting a hard limit. This award supports research that seeks to establish a novel paradigm that enables robots to handle uncertainties and unknowns through the lens of \u201cmanipulation funnels.\u201d The concept of manipulation funnel is the same as that of an ordinary use funnel, wherein the idea is to filter a large set of task possibilities through a restrictive neck, defined by robot compliance or motion strategy, to a smaller set ensuring that the subsequent robot actions are robust against uncertainties. This new paradigm will improve real-world robot applications, such as those used in industrial production, household services, and healthcare. The award will also support several STEM initiatives, with focus on broadening participation to underrepresented groups, including hands-on robotic manipulation tutorials and an accompanying book, curriculum enhancement with research outcomes, and research opportunities for undergraduate and K-12 students.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to depart from the traditional pipeline of perception, planning, and control for robotic manipulation by generalizing the idea of geometric manipulation funnels in task space to new classes of funnels based on robot compliance and motion strategy for robust and dexterous manipulation against environmental uncertainties. Within this context, the focus is on identifying the entries, shaping the necks, and finding the exits in these new classes of manipulation funnels. For example, by leveraging active or passive compliance, funnels that are initially blocked can be can actively \u201copened\u201d to precisely manipulate objects through self-stabilizing task formations and facilitate contact-rich manipulation with enlarged planning spaces and simplified control. Similarly, by leveraging motions and task constraints, funnels can be actively created to cage the state transitions in time to effectively reduce uncertainties or even directly figure out the mapping from uncertain manipulation inputs to their possible outputs. Furthermore, by transferring funnels through tasks and composing multi-modal manipulation solutions via funnel concatenations, the proposed funnel-based framework will enable complex manipulation tasks while firmly guaranteeing robustness. As a result, this project will enable robots to manipulate through a non-traditional but more reliable framework, allowing them to work in highly uncertain scenarios that were traditionally infeasible.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
