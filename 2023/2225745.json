 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's Indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This Instructional Capacity Excellence in TCUP Institutions (ICE-TI) project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover seeks to strengthen STEM instructional capacity across the Northwest region, build certificate programs designed to increase skills of working professionals, and provide opportunities for advanced degree attainment at Northwest Indian College (NWIC). \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is to design, implement, and assess comprehensive institutional improvements at NWIC by focusing on three areas of STEM capacity building including enhancing STEM instructional capacity at satellite campus sites, building post-baccalaureate certificate programs for working STEM professionals, and developing a Master\u2019s degree in Native Environmental Science, the first graduate program at the institution. The project has three main goals: (1) increasing student access to culturally-grounded and place-based undergraduate STEM programming through enhanced distance education, (2) providing working professionals in the Natural Resources fields with opportunities for professional development through certificate programs that enhance skills and knowledge for workforce development in emerging fields, and (3) increasing access to graduate programming in STEM fields through the development of a Master of Science Degree. All activities are informed by a strong community engagement process and applied research opportunities for students and faculty. This project contributes to the workforce development, economic development, and training of tribal college students and tribal citizens in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
