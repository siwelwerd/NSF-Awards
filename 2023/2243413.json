 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need for preparing high-quality mathematics and science teachers. Nationally, mathematics and science teaching positions are hard to staff particularly in high-need schools. Through the education pathway envisioned by this project, participants will begin at a two-year or a four-year college, transfer to a math or science education/teacher licensure program at a four-year college, co-enroll in a master\u2019s degree program, gain teacher licensure, and return to high-need schools as math or science teachers. The project will enhance math and science education coursework and experiences for undergraduates and graduate students by integrating mentored student teaching experiences; developing innovative course curricula using design thinking; creating modules showing design thinking in action that scholars and education professionals may access to enhance their science and math curriculum; and facilitating professional development opportunities to develop participants\u2019 professional identities as teachers prepared to succeed in high-need schools.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will support 15 undergraduate students along a five-year education pathway through a STEM degree (chemistry, biology, mathematics) and a Master of Science in Teaching (MST) as part of their preparation for a New York State adolescent-education teaching certification for grades 7\u201312. The goal is to prepare the scholarship recipients to teach in high-need local educational agency classrooms near Iona University, such as Ossining Union Free School District and Mount Vernon City School District. This project builds from a successful Noyce Capacity Building project, through which Iona and Westchester Community College (WCC) built a 2+2+1 articulation agreement for students to earn an associate degree at WCC in addition to a STEM degree and an MST at Iona. This project will make use of a place-based interdisciplinary module designed to expose students in entry-level chemistry courses to the idea of using urban ecology as an interdisciplinary subject with connections to math, chemistry, and biology. The project will also employ design thinking within the urban ecology modules. Design thinking is an innovative concept regularly used by Fortune 500 companies as a creative problem-solving process to contemplate and discover innovative solutions to problems of all kinds. The proposed project is designed to accomplish the following objectives. (1) Recruit a minimum of 15 Iona STEM majors or WCC transfer students who will have the coursework needed for NYS teaching certification through participation in the Noyce Scholars program. (2) Retain at least 93% of original Scholars through strategies that include experiential learning opportunities, academic enrichment, and mentoring. (3) Prepare program participants to teach in high-need LEAs. (4) Graduate and place 100% of Noyce Scholars in high-need LEAs. (5) Track and support the persistence of Noyce Scholar alumni during their high-need LEA teaching service and beyond by providing mentorship and induction support activities. The Iona Noyce program will contribute knowledge to the field of teacher preparation by exploring the use of interdisciplinary STEM modules as a tool for Scholars to experience place-based STEM teaching first as students and then later as teachers. Additionally, Scholars will engage in experiences that include summer research, fieldwork, and a Design Thinking and Innovation workshop introducing the main principles of design thinking and the use of design thinking for developing curricula and motivating educational change. This combination of curriculum, activities, and support is built on best practices and is intended to develop Scholars\u2019 identities as teachers, giving them a sense of their abilities as professionals, researchers, innovators, and mentors who can tackle challenges in the classroom. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
