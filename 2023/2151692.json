 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the design of products that will decompose in nature, are paper-stream recyclable, and Ocean Compostable Fish Friendly (OCFF), with a cost similar to plastic packaging.  Since 2018, the US typically recycles between 5-8.7% of its plastic. According to Ocean Conservancy, \u201cEvery year, 11 million metric tons of plastics enter the ocean on top of the estimated 200 million metric tons that currently circulate the marine environments.\u201d The proposed products do not need biocides and use no additives in their production process.  The products are made with 100% Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified tree cellulose, which ensures that the product will come from sustainably harvested trees. These products will drastically reduce plastic waste while bringing jobs back to rural areas in need of economic development. The products are non-toxic and will compost anywhere and everywhere. \r\n \r\nThis SBIR Phase II project continues the prototype development of novel products and the commercialization of a new molding and drying technology/techniques required to produce Ocean Compostable Fish Friendly packaging that is durable, functional, and digestible in nature. This product is expected to be adopted by the growing number of consumers who want environmentally-safe, single-use packaging products. This product replaces single-use plastics and other bioplastics. It is naturally grease resistant and will replace perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are being banned nationwide due to their harmful effects on human health. Leading Polylactic Acid (PLA) compostable packaging products are not compostable in nature and contaminate recycling streams. These products will have a material that feels and costs similar to plastic, is greaseproof, and is not harmful to nature and wildlife if littered. The initial product is a souffl\u00e9 cup comprised of 100% fibrillated cellulose (FC) from trees, a material not yet developed for packaging on a commercial scale. Phase I results included a patent-pending benchtop system that dewaters and molds the FC into desired shapes. The goal of this project is to scale the machine to mold 100% FC into products that customers desire.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
