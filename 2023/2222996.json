 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to ensure the secure transfer of goods and/or passengers in commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) and prevent the likelihood of secondary incidents when a commercial motor vehicles (CMV) has made an emergency stop on a highway. All CMVs need to comply with traffic safety regulations and deploy emergency warning devices (e.g., safety triangles) during an emergency stop. Without the presence of a human driver, an automated CMV should also be able to automate emergency warning device placement. Proper placement of these warning devices can be life-saving for drivers of non-automated vehicles on a highway. The proposed project will increase the safety of external drivers by preventing any secondary incidents associated with the lane/shoulder blockage due to a CMV malfunction and protect drivers of non-automated and/or semi-automated vehicles by assisting in the deployment of emergency warning triangles on highways. This project aims to remove barriers to higher-order automated technology adoption due to lack of standardization.\r\n\r\nThe project will result in the design, research, and development of an affordable, after-market, reliable, and safe autonomous Warning Triangle System (aWTS) to ensure the safety of the automated and semi-automated commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) during an emergency stop without requiring human assistance. aWTS consists of three low-cost autonomous triangle reflector devices which are planned to optimally fit in a charging dock/enclosure where they will be safely stored during stand-by mode. When activated by the emergency signal transmitted from the CMV, the autonomous triangles are designed to move successively to their pre-determined destinations on the highway. The research and development activity during this Phase I project includes, but is not limited to: reviewing safety codes and regulations, investigating different highway scenarios and associated challenges, and performing computer simulations; developing proof-of-concept hardware that can demonstrate the proposed system\u2019s technical feasibility and its integration to automated CMVs; determining the optimal placement and assembly of the autonomous reflective triangles by collaborating with auto manufacturers; investigating the potential cyber-security risks to develop secure communications between CMV and aWTS; and identifying the operational challenges and the design targets while considering the cost of deployment, lifecycle costs, functional use, and interoperability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
