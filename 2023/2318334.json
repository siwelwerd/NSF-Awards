 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to utilize quantum computing to perform computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, initially to solve problems in the aerospace and automotive industries. The technology may also play a vital role in national defense, as CFD is critical in designing aircraft, missiles, armored vehicles, and naval systems. Subsequently, the product will find many other industrial applications, including healthcare applications, such as simulating blood flow in organs or airflow in the lungs. The product will help companies to reduce the cost and time in developing superior technologies, such as safer aircraft that consume less fuel, energy plants that emit less carbon dioxide (CO2), and devices that deliver drugs more effectively. The project includes a partnership between academic and industrial researchers. By involving student interns and exposing them to the emerging field of quantum computing, this project aims to contribute to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) workforce development. Ultimately, this project aims to create a new generation of CFD technology based on quantum computing, advancing the CFD field, and aiding U.S. leadership in quantum computing.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new CFD technology for quantum computers. CFD is a valuable tool for engineers to predict fluid flow and design or troubleshoot various systems such as airplanes, automobiles, and chemical reactors. However, some CFD simulations are too expensive or impossible to run, even though such knowledge could save hundreds of millions of dollars in certifying each new aircraft type. High resolution slows CFD simulations because large amounts of data must be stored in, read from, and written to the computer memory. This limitation can be overcome by utilizing the vast quantum state spaces that have become available with the introduction of quantum computers. An algorithm will be implemented in a software prototype and the flow between fixed and moving plates will be simulated on quantum computers. A performance metric estimated from the simulation results will assess the potential for achieving a quantum advantage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
