 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this track 2 project aims to improve access to data science education for Hispanic students at community colleges where a disproportionately large number of students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields access college. It will do so by developing introductory data science courses and establishing them as a pathway to further data science educational opportunities. The project will also build a comprehensive model for building instructional capacity at community colleges that includes a community college-research institution partnership and research institution preceptors (post PhD instructors). This work will not only reach students at Truman but will also set the stage for growing data science programs at other Chicago community colleges as well as Hispanic-serving community colleges nationwide. \r\n\r\nThe specific aims of this project are to collaborate with the University of Chicago to develop and implement data science courses, utilize a preceptor model to build instructional capacity in the community college setting, and establish the curriculum and a data science pathway that prepares Hispanic students for future employment and transfer. The research questions focus on specifying the data science program model including the role of transfer partners and industry employers; examining the role of intersectionality and culturally responsive pedagogy; and articulating the nature of the community college-research institution partnership and the role preceptor programs play in that partnership. The research will use quantitative and qualitative data collection methods including questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups. This project will provide insights, guidance, and a model for community college data science education and share those findings through academic channels including professional meetings and peer review journals as well as channels more commonly accessed by practitioners. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
