 "awd_abstract_narration": "The seaward motion of ice sheets and glaciers is primarily controlled by basal sliding at the base of the ice sheet and internal viscous flow within the ice mass. The latter of these \u2014 viscous flow \u2014 is dependent on various factors, including temperature, stress, grain size, and the alignment of ice crystals during flow to produce a \"crystal orientation fabric\" (COF). Historically, ice flow has been modeled using an equation, termed \u201cGlen\u2019s law\u201d, that describes ice-flow rate as a function of temperature and stress. Glen\u2019s law was constrained under relatively high-stress conditions and is often attributed to the motion of crystal defects within ice grains. More recently, however, grain boundary sliding (GBS) has been invoked as the rate-controlling process under low-stress, \u201csuperplastic\u201d conditions. The grain boundary sliding hypothesis is contentious because GBS is not thought to produce a COF, whereas geophysical measurements and polar ice cores demonstrate strong COFs in polar ice masses. However, very few COF measurements have been conducted on ice samples subjected to superplastic flow conditions in the laboratory. This project would measure the evolution of ice COF across the transition from superplastic to Glen-type creep. Results will be used to interrogate the role of superplastic GBS creep within polar ice masses, and thereby provide constraints on polar ice discharge models.\r\n\r\nPolycrystalline ice samples with grain sizes ranging from 5 \u00b5m to 1000 \u00b5m will be fabricated and deformed in a laboratory, using a 1-atm cryogenic axial-torsion apparatus. Experiments will be conducted at temperatures of -30\u00b0C to -10\u00b0C, and at a constant uniaxial strain rate. Under these conditions, 5% to 99.99% of strain should be accommodated by superplastic, GBS-limited creep, depending on the sample grain size. The deformed samples will then be imaged using cryogenic electron backscatter diffraction (cryo-EBSD) and high-angular-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) to quantify COF, grain size, grain shape, and crystal defect (dislocation) densities, among other microstructural properties. These measurements will be used to decipher the rate-controlling mechanisms operating within different thermomechanical regimes, and resolve a long-standing debate over whether superplastic creep can produce a COF in ice. In addition to the polycrystal experiments, ice bicrystals will be fabricated and deformed to investigate the micromechanical behavior of individual grain boundaries under superplastic conditions. Ultimately, these results will be used to provide a microstructural toolbox for identifying superplastic creep using geophysical (e.g., seismic, radar) and glaciological (e.g., ice core) observations. This project will support one graduate student, one or more undergraduate summer students, and an early-career researcher. In addition, this project will support a workshop aimed at bringing together experimentalists, glaciologists, and ice modelers to facilitate cross-disciplinary knowledge sharing and collaborative problem solving.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
