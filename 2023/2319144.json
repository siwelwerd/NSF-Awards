 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will map the space-time geography of internal gravity wave (IW) dissipation and mixing, and the underlying dynamics, using state-of-the-art high-resolution global and regional IW models along with theory and observations of IWs.  The research will employ global models, regional models, observations, and theory to take a first step towards a future in which IW dissipation and mixing arise naturally in models, without being parameterized. The project will support two summer schools on ocean and environmental science in Kenya, East Africa, to complement the successful West African summer schools that has been run every year since 2015, with cumulative participation of several hundred African participants and several dozen US participants.\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigators hypothesize that the representation of the IW spectrum in global IW models is sufficiently realistic for the models to make useful predictions about spatial and temporal distributions of IW dissipation and, by extension, IW-induced mixing. They also hypothesize that much as an inertial subrange is implicitly resolved by Large Eddy Simulations of turbulence, an implicitly resolved IW continuum in models may be within reach with appropriate choices of dissipation schemes, model resolutions, atmospheric forcing frequency, and enabling of nonhydrostatic dynamics. Regional IW models will be run to determine the impacts of resolution limitations and dissipation mechanisms on the modeled IW spectrum. Regional IW simulations and IW theory will be used to probe the dynamics underlying the IW spectrum and dissipation.  Dissipation will be mapped using four different methods: as spectral fluxes computed using traditional Fourier techniques, as spectral fluxes computed using new coarse-graining techniques, as a residual of IW conversion rates and flux divergences, and as computed from model dissipation operators applied to high-frequency flow. Modeled energy dissipation rates will be compared to observation-based estimates of dissipation, from fine-structure methods applied to ARGO floats and ship-based CTD lines, and from microstructure measurements including those from a new NSF-funded set of EM-APEX floats.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
