 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymer membranes are the modern technology used to remove particulates and waterborne pathogens from dirty water and wastewater. During operation, membranes get fouled and require regular physical and/or chemical cleaning, which increases process downtime and causes membrane degradation. Additionally, it is unfortunate that the modern process used to manufacture polymer membranes relies heavily on toxic solvents and that the membrane itself does not prevent the accumulation of particulates on its surface. This Boosting Research Ideas for Transformative and Equitable Advances in Engineering (BRITE) award supports fundamental research that integrates disaggregated prior results to manufacture polymer membranes that resist fouling. The membranes will feature a new chemistry that will enable an all-aqueous manufacturing process that does not use toxic solvents. Selective polymer membranes that resist fouling are preferred for wastewater treatment and water remediation applications, as well as additional separation applications, such as industrial cleaning, food processing, protein separation, and gene engineering. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy, the environment, and society. This research will educate, provide research experiences, and mentor a diverse workforce at the emerging interface of chemical engineering, polymer science, and microbiology. \r\n\r\nSince the 1960s, non-solvent induced phase separation has been used to manufacture polymer membranes, which are essential in sustainable separation processes. Unfortunately, the manufacturing process generates more than fifty billion liters of toxic solvent-contaminated wastewater annually. This research provides fundamental insights into the manufacturing of chemically resilient porous polymer membranes processed from all-aqueous solutions of water-soluble charged polymers. Specifically, we will (1) develop a mechanistic understanding of how to manufacture high performance membranes from water soluble charged polymers, water, and salt; and (2) evaluate the stability, performance, and fouling resistance of the porous membranes. By conducting permeance testing in parallel to membrane manufacturing, we will have a feedback loop between the chemistry, morphology, and performance of the membranes. This research will establish an inclusive research team in polymer membranes for water separations and also provide research opportunities for underrepresented students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
