 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project's significance lies in its ability to provide supportive hands-on, experiential education in the life sciences and biotechnology fields, providing on-ramps to underserved and underrepresented individuals previously unable to access STEM opportunities, thus enabling substantial career pivots. The inability to meet the growing demand for biotechnicians weakens the nation's position as the global bioeconomy leader and poses national security risks. Through a certificate program and upskilling courses with robust support services that enable success, the project will increase employability, wage potential, and career growth for up to 180 adults over two years. This serves the national interest by promoting the progress of science, advancing, and supporting education and diversity. The project also contributes to the advancement in the biotechnology field and benefits society by producing professionals for the growing biomanufacturing industry. Additionally, the project fosters a more inclusive scientific community and provides an example of innovative, hands-on learning for the adult vocational learner. It establishes a framework for closing a workforce gap while simultaneously addressing societal goals of promoting equity and increasing access for diverse learners.\r\n\r\nGloucester Marine Genomics Institute (GMGI), a 501c3 non-profit founded in 2013, addresses critical challenges facing our oceans, human health and the environment through innovative scientific research and education. GMGI operates the Gloucester Biotechnology Academy, whose 10-month biotechnology certificate program combines hands-on classroom and laboratory training with paid internships. GMGI prepares adults with no prior mathematics or science experience who are struggling to connect with college and career, to pivot into roles as laboratory technicians in life science and biotechnology fields. GMGI's proprietary curriculum allows participants to master standard lab practices and fundamental molecular biology techniques including DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing. A biomanufacturing workflow follows and participants prepare solutions, media and plates for growing cells, engineer bacterial cells to produce proteins of interest, generate cell banks and confirm productivity, demonstrate proficiency in batching, sampling and decontaminating fermentation processes, practice upstream and downstream processing and purification, and incorporate process analytical technologies to monitor mammalian cell cultures in single-use bioreactors. Students learn on industry-recommended equipment including thermocyclers, UV-Vis plate readers, NanoDrop/Qubit instruments, electrophoresis gel chambers, DNA sequencers, BioFlo fermenters, Celligen CLU single-use bioreactions, AKTA Pure column chromatography, and additional tools. In addition to technical coursework, students complete a career skills curriculum preparing them for the job search and professional laboratory environment. This project will increase outreach to move diverse and economically disadvantaged communities and includes robust wrap-around services for adult vocational learners including stipends, childcare and housing vouchers, technology and transportation, DEIA training, as well as resources for mental health services. The comprehensive curriculum taught by industry experts and experienced educators breaks barriers and will be a model to enable expansion and scalability, thereby closing important workforce gaps in the advanced manufacturing fields. Outcomes will be thoughtfully captured, monitored, and shared broadly through conferences and publications across research, education, and industry.  This project aligns with the NSF ExLENT Program, funded by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, as it seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals from diverse professional and educational backgrounds to increase their interest in, and their access to, career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
