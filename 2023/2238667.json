Similarly for K and X, or for the letter B and number 8. These examples reflect properties that are known in mathematics as topological invariants. Recently, the research field of topological invariants has emerged as a powerful method to characterize global properties of materials, irrespective of details such as impurities and defects. Currently, this framework largely describes systems at equilibrium, with identical atoms that are arranged in an orderly manner. In contrast, biological systems are often far away from equilibrium and consist of many different components that exhibit disorder and noise. This CAREER award supports research to establish a theory of topological invariants for biological systems and for synthetic materials that mimic biological systems. The PI will use an interdisciplinary approach, employing theoretical methods from mathematics, physics, and biology, to identify general principles that render biological functions robust, maintaining the same type of behavior over long periods of time even if external conditions change. The award also supports educational and outreach activities that aim at increasing interest in science among under-represented groups through nurturing the interplay between physics with dance and movement. Specific efforts include the development of an interdisciplinary class on dance and physics, teaching modules on dance and movement for use in high schools, and demonstrations on the physics of dance.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how the underlying components of proteins, RNAs, metabolites and other biologically relevant molecules give rise to biological function would enable precise targeting of interventions to enhance health. However, there still does not exist a good theory for these complex and noisy systems. As just one example, despite successful sequencing of the human genome, it remains challenging to predict the behavior of resulting proteins and macromolecules due to the large phase space of possible reactions and configurations. The goal of this project is to develop a generalizable theory based on physical principles that can predict stable and evolving function in living systems. Specifically, the PI will use an interdisciplinary approach that draws on recent theoretical developments in topology, molecular biology, and non-equilibrium physics to achieve this goal. Topological invariants have proved useful for analyzing emergent function as they characterize a property of the entire system, and are insensitive to local details, disorder, and noise. They support edge states, which reduce the system response to a lower dimensional space and offer a mechanism for the emergence of global cycles within a large space of reactions. \r\n\r\nThis research effort will inform an educational platform about the underlying principles of dynamics and physical movement, towards making physics more tangible to students traditionally under-represented in science. At the scale of human interactions, this interdisciplinary work will foster inclusion and diversity through the interplay between physics with dance and movement with the objective of increasing interest in science among under-represented groups. This effort will comprise the following three efforts. First, the PI will create a new interdisciplinary class on dance and physics at Rice to draw students who may not be initially interested in science. Second, in collaboration with the Rice Office of STEM Engagement, the PI will work with Houston teachers to develop teaching modules on dance and movement for use in high schools, towards integrating existing student groups into discussions on science. Third, the PI will work with a non-profit black, indigenous and people of color organization to design demonstrations on the physics of dance in afterschool activities and public events for underserved communities, in order to foster public scientific literacy. These educational efforts will bring different worlds together to inspire new knowledge in existing communities and increase the pipeline of under-represented students in STEM education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
