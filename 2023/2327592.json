 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Virginia Operator Theory and Complex Analysis Meeting, to be held at the University of Richmond in Fall 2023, Fall 2024, and Fall 2025. Established in 1992, the Virginia Operator Theory and Complex Analysis Meeting is a one-day event which convenes researchers in Virginia, North Carolina, and neighboring states working in various fields both within and adjacent to the mathematical discipline of analysis. Subjects to be discussed include core areas of analysis as well as emerging application domains such as quantum computing. The event affords early career researchers, especially graduate students, opportunities to meet new mathematical colleagues and to disseminate their research ideas to a wider audience. At the same time, the small size of these events fosters community interaction and promotes increased dialogue and networking for the benefit of all participants.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Operator Theory and Complex Analysis Meeting is a regional meeting of mathematicians working in the fields of operator theory, complex analysis, Banach spaces, and operator algebras. The meeting also places emphasis on new connections and interactions between these subjects and adjacent and emerging fields such as quantum computing and mathematical physics. The conference offers a welcoming environment for people new to the discipline of analysis and to mathematics and promotes the exchange of ideas among researchers in analysis and related fields in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions.\r\n\r\nhttps://votcam.wordpress.com\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
