 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Track 2 project aims to establish a wastewater-based epidemiology training program at The City University of New York to respond to declining minority student retention and graduation rates in STEM. These declines hamper workforce development in industries clamoring for STEM talent and ultimately U.S. competitiveness in emerging technologies. The project will train students with wastewater-based epidemiology technologies and competencies, preparing the next generation of workers to face challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. It is hypothesized that inspiring community college students with career prospects in an emerging technology, such as wastewater-based epidemiology, and providing academic, research, and social mentoring from role models that they can identify with will improve student retention, graduation rates, and career success. The program will generate interest in wastewater-based epidemiology as a career option, thus enhancing US pandemic preparedness. The program will also have ripple effects in different areas of society, such as water management, healthcare, public recreation and health, regulatory policy, science education, and economic mobility for graduates of the program and their families. By participating in the training program, students will be well-positioned for high-paying jobs in the public and private sectors or for graduate school.\r\n\r\nThe specific aims of the project are:  Aim 1- Advance the effectiveness of STEM education and workforce development programs, activities, and outreach through evaluation and assessment; Aim 2- Attract and train the Nation\u2019s future STEM workforce through multiple pathways to educational and career opportunities; Aim 3- Increase participation of underserved and underrepresented groups in STEM education and workforce development programs, activities, and outreach; and Aim 4- Inspire community engagement in STEM education programs and activities to provide meaningful wastewater-based epidemiology learning opportunities for students and educators. The evaluation will include the use of surveys, interviews, observations, and career tracking to determine the impact of the program on students. The combination of pedagogical activities and hands-on experiential education, including internships and job training, will provide students with opportunities to commence STEM careers following graduation. The results of our work will be disseminated through publications, conference presentations, and through CUNY internal networks. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
