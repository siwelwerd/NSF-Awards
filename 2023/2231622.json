 "awd_abstract_narration": "The eCAT center concentrates on interdisciplinary research centered around electric, connected and autonomous vehicles (eCAVs). The center not only serves as an apparatus of academic researchers collaborating with industry on problems of high national and international importance, but also provides  opportunities industry partners to access the advanced synergic research produced by a diverse group of researchers. The eCAT Center will accelerate the transformation of mobility methods from conventional vehicles to eCAVs and facilitate a new collaboration paradigm for the transportation industry by developing long-term partnerships among industry, academe, and government. \r\n\r\nOur trans-disciplinary research team located at multiple sites will focus on innovative research and development towards the integration of electrification and autonomous technologies in various domains, including advanced electric vehicles (EVs) and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, reliable Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communication devices, high performance edge computing platforms, efficient algorithms for sensor data processing, and the creation of connected autonomous driving systems. The Clarkson University Site will focus on hardware support and computing backbone, especially employing edge computing, edge server, cloud computing in a holistic and integrated fashion to address the computing need for connected and autonomous driving workloads. \r\n\r\nThe eCAT Center will strive to advance the science and technologies towards realizing eCAVs in our daily life. The center will accelerate both knowledge and intellectual property (IP) transfer between academia and industry through collaborative partnerships. This will allow for the rapid transformation of the state-of-the-art mobility technologies from research labs to industry and market. Educational efforts will be devoted to (i) curriculum design at undergraduate and graduate levels, (ii) summer camp development for K-12 students, (iii) broadening participation in computing and engineering, at Clarkson University and the other eCAT Sites as well. \r\n\r\nData obtained from this project will include experimental, computational, text-based, and/or curricular data. All data products will be retained for a minimum of three years after conclusion of the award or three years after public release (publication), whichever is later. The Sites of the Center will have password-protected shared network drives to facilitate data sharing within the teams, with collaborators, and indeed anyone in the community with an interest in the NSF-funded data. A landing page for navigation to archived data will be created at http://ecat.center.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
