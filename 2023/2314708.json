 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving the classroom experience for Deaf and Hard of Hearing (D/HH) students in their undergraduate chemistry courses. Importantly, this project has the potential to broaden participation in STEM and contribute to creating a more diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. One of the greatest challenges for D/HH students pursuing STEM careers is the lack of formalized STEM sign terminology. Thus, improving the chemistry classroom culture to become more inclusive and welcoming of D/HH students through formalized sign incorporation is central to this project. The innovative project aims to develop and implement chemistry signs that intuitively convey the concepts and terms in order to: (i) increase cognitive and affective gains among D/HH students in a variety of  chemistry courses, (ii) improve D/HH classroom culture and inclusion practices when the faculty and interpreter teams facilitate STEM sign incorporation, and (iii) improve standardization and propagation of chemistry terminology within the D/HH community. The project\u2019s success will afford a greater understanding of the manner in which science is taught to D/HH students and potentially inform education practices for auditory learners. \r\n\r\nThe project intends to address the challenges associated with learning chemistry as a D/HH student, particularly as it pertains to the lack of a formalized sign lexicon in chemistry courses. The goals of the project will be to: (1) develop sign lexicons for general, organic, and biochemistry courses that intuitively convey the concepts and terms taught in these courses; (2) sustain a method for continual use of the new chemistry signs among D/HH students and interpreters; (3) distribute the newly developed signs to D/HH students, instructors, and interpreters in the STEM community; and (4) evaluate and assess the effectiveness of efforts as they relate to D/HH student success, self-efficacy, science identity, and sense of belonging while enrolled in the chemistry course sequence. A combination of quantitative and qualitative assessment tools will be used to address both formative and summative evaluation and assessment activities.  The results of the project will be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding via workshops, peer-reviewed publication, conference presentations, and the ASLcore website. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
