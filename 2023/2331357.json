 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inspiring the Generation of New Ideas and Translational Excellence at Florida State University (\u201cIGNITE-FSU\u201d) project is a transformational initiative that will serve as a connector and catalyst for the translation of products and services out of the research community in Tallahassee, FL, and ensure maximal impact on the Florida economy and beyond. IGNITE-FSU will build capacity for translational research through additional staff, supportive programs, and mutually beneficial partnerships \u2014 all geared to identify, mature, harvest, and translate ideas into impact. This will provide the spark needed to ignite a thriving innovation ecosystem that benefits the entire North Florida regional economy by developing and translating tangible solutions to societal challenges. IGNITE-FSU is led by the institution\u2019s VP for Research, VP for Faculty Development and Advancement, and Dean of the Graduate School, and includes the university President as an ART Ambassador to drive institutional culture change.  \r\n\r\nIGNITE-FSU consists of capacity-building and training activities specifically designed to achieve four overarching objectives: (1) Enhance FSU\u2019s translational research infrastructure through the addition and/or re-alignment of staff, partnerships, and resources. (2) Foster translational and entrepreneurial talent by providing educational opportunities for faculty, students (graduate and undergraduate), postdocs, and entrepreneurs in the community. (3) Establish pathways to impact through Idea Ignition and Seed Translational Research Project (\u201cSTRP\u201d) programs, and meaningful innovation ecosystem partnerships. (4) Develop an institutional culture that inspires innovation, celebrates inclusive excellence, and serves our community and region.  The IGNITE-FSU team will be supported by mentorship opportunities through a partnership with the University of Florida and will ensure that the entire local community benefits from NSF-funded activities through partnerships with Florida A&M University, and a variety of local innovation ecosystem partners collectively represented by the Alliance of Entrepreneur Resource Organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
