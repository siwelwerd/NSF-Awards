 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metal additive manufacturing (AM) such as laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) has been increasingly explored not only for product innovation, but also shop-floor production, demonstrated by growing success from a variety of industries. However, the lack of knowledge in both fatigue failure and the performance uncertainty of LPBF parts poses a significant challenge and undermines the potential of deploying LPBF for high-consequence applications. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to understand the effects of LPBF processing on defects and subsequent fatigue behavior, advance the knowledge of fatigue scattering of LPBF parts that are complex in geometry and subject to multiaxial loading. The effort will establish a physics-centric, machine learning framework for fatigue life predictions, serving as a technological foundation for future metal AM production of dynamic load-bearing applications, and thus, enhance the competitiveness of U.S. industry. This CAREER project will also integrate education and outreach programs designed to broaden the participation from underrepresented groups through actively engaging K-12 students for STEM education and recruiting women and minorities into research, priming future generations of diverse engineers with the knowledge and skills indispensable in the age of manufacturing innovation and big data.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of this early career effort is to understand fatigue failures of complex LPBF parts under multiaxial loading for data-driven fatigue life predictions. The research will investigate the nature of fatigue failures from plastic deformation and crack initiation at the highest stress concentrations and translate fatigue life predictions into evaluating the crack growth at the vulnerable zones using a multiscale approach. On the micro-scale, critical defects with crack-initiating features (by x-ray computed tomography or optical profilometry) will be identified based on the correlation with fatigue failures; both the effects of critical defects and their spatial interactions on crack growth will be examined using fracture mechanics and data-intense statistics. On the part scale, the weak regions of the highest stress concentrations will be examined by finite element modeling of stress and strain behaviors through decoupling multiaxial loading. The effects of critical defects and the principal stresses at vulnerable localities will then be incorporated into a hierarchical graph convolutional network of deep learning to model their synergistic impacts on crack growth and calculate the fatigue life of LPBF parts with advanced data analytics. The findings are expected to generate new knowledge of defect formation relevant to fatigue performance of LPBF parts, uncover the synergistic impacts of multiscale factors on fatigue fractures, and further LPBF adoption for high-consequence applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
