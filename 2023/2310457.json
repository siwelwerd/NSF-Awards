 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides student travel and registration support to attend and participate in the 2023 The American Society of Mechanical Engineers - Energy Sustainability (ASME-ES) Conference. ASME is a professional engineering organization that enables collaboration, knowledge sharing, career enrichment and skills development across all engineering disciplines. Its goal is to help the global engineering community develop solutions to benefit society. The ASME-ES conference brings together scholars and practitioners in a wide range of energy sustainability fields. The conference highlights advances in research, design and manufacture of sustainable and innovative energy technologies from building to utility scales as well as society-level energy analyses and solutions. Advanced manufacturing plays a key role in pursuing energy sustainability from materials synthesis to system design to manufacturing. ASME-ES 2023 promotes tracks with an emphasis on advanced manufacturing. The conference offers participants an opportunity to share their scientific discoveries, interact with peers and colleagues from academia, government labs, and industry, extend their network, and foster new collaborations within the broader advanced manufacturing community. Consistent with NSF's goal to broaden the participation of groups underrepresented in science and engineering, the conference allocates travel funds to students from underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities. This approach promotes greater diversity in STEM fields and benefits the nation by educating and training a skilled workforce better prepared to provide transformative solutions to overcome challenges in their chosen fields. The conference meets the national priorities of advancing energy sustainability and achieving diversity, equity and inclusion.\r\n\r\nASME-ES presents a unique platform for the mechanical engineering and other engineering communities to focus on approaches to energy sustainability. The engineering community has close collaboration with manufacturing industries, which facilitates prompt transition of fundamental research to industry and useful commercial products. The conference committee has identified synergistic opportunities and platforms for energy sustainability, covering materials science, advanced manufacturing, integrated systems design and education and training. Support of this conference aligns with NSF\u2019s mission of fostering fundamental research in science and engineering, translating the research outcomes to industry and applications and advancing education and workforce development. The conference provides a forum for emerging scientists and engineers to showcase their scientific accomplishments, interact with peers and extend their network within the broader engineering and academic communities. This activity facilitates future career opportunities in academia and industry for participating students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It encompassed fourteen specialty areas, including HelioCon, the Heliostat Consortium for Concentrating Solar-Thermal Power led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The event also featured the selection of high-quality conference papers for a special issue in the ASME Journal of Energy Resources Technology (JERT) and the ASME Journal of Engineering for Sustainable Buildings and Cities. Additionally, the conference organized an Underrepresented in STEM Lunch Discussion to promote diversity in STEM. The cohort of attendees comprised eighteen graduate students and two undergraduates. Six students presented accepted papers, twelve delivered oral presentations, and three showcased posters during the conference. Notably, five female and minority students were among the attendees. Two students, including one from a minority group, joined the Renewable Energy and Energy Conversion committee in ASME during the conference.
