 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides NSF support to broaden participation in three co-located conferences - The 29th IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA), IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO), and ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP) - held in Montreal, Canada in February-March 2023. This award supports approximately 24 students to attend these symposia, which are attended by leading researchers from academia, both students and faculty, and from industry. The symposia were held annually separately for many years, and jointly since 2013. Students who attend the conferences are exposed to intellectually stimulating research by attending the many talks, panels, keynotes, and poster presentations at the conferences.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to increase the impact of these conferences by enabling the participation of additional students for whom travel support would otherwise preclude their attendance. Students receiving travel grants through this award will learn the importance of good communication skills as well as learn about what it takes to conduct high-quality research, through interactions with speakers, faculty, and peer student groups. The award also enhances the diversity of the attendees, thus maintaining a balance between underrepresented and other groups among the participants supported by the grant. Priority for these funds is given to defray the travel expenses of under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
