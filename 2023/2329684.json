 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds to organize the annual meeting of Principal Investigators of the Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier (FW-HTF) program. The team of investigators will design, manage and execute the 2023 NSF FW-HTF PI Meeting at Northeastern University\u2019s Boston campus from August 31 to September 1, 2023. The convening will provide a platform for sharing progress, exchanging ideas, and facilitating further collaborations. Intellectual merit stems from convening interdisciplinary researchers, stakeholders, and public, private, and government representatives to exchange updates on their projects, innovations, and discoveries linked to the future of work at the human-technology frontier. The two-day program will provide opportunities to highlight progress on active projects funded by NSF. Panel sessions on industry perspectives, research convergence, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and measuring impact will create a forum for realizing the future of work, especially during disruptive global and local events, such as pandemics, disasters, and conflicts.\r\n\r\nThe 2023 FW-HTF PI meeting will invite the principal investigators, selected graduate students, and industry and community stakeholders. This event will be the first in-person PI meeting since the COVID-19 Pandemic. Hence it will provide an opportunity for this community to have overdue discussions and create new collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
