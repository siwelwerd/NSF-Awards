 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, foundational research in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and data science, have drawn incredible interest. Some of the research has focused on using these data-driven approaches to enhance scientific and engineering discoveries in other disciplines. While workshops and meetings have been held around the world by the to discuss cutting-edge breakthroughs and emerging trends, the majority of events are structured for siloed scientific fields. A paradigm-shifting scientific revolution might be made possible by integrating important discoveries across these events (i.e., a meta-workshop) to develop cogent novel insights. This project supports a meta-workshop on AI to accelerate science and engineering discovery. The workshop will provide the scientific community with information on the state of complementary research in AI, machine learning and other data analytic approaches across the science and engineering domains. The topics of interest include identifying specific subject areas with high potential for data-driven approaches to discovery.\r\n\r\nThis meta-workshop will bring together leaders of AI, ML, data science and science and engineering (e.g., biology, biological engineering, chemistry, chemical engineering, physics, material science, etc). The majority of attendees will be core organizers from recent workshops and meetings around the heart of data-intensive discoveries. They will include the most important findings from their events and collaborate with other participants to generate new insights. The ultimate goal of the meta-workshop is to work with the leaders of diverse disciplines to develop a coherent and far-reaching research program agenda. Data-intensive AI/ML techniques with broad applicability across domains can lead to transformative discovery in domain sciences and engineering and address the biggest global societal challenges (such as promoting human health, using renewable energy, containing and managing climate change, feeding the expanding population without damaging the environment, and establishing a just and sustainable society). For the economic growth and general well-being of our nation, this workshop will also target ways to create the industries and workforce of the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
