 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will initiate a Travel Grant program for faculty from typically under-resourced institutions, such as Emerging Research Institutions (ERIs), Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and community colleges.  Faculty at these institutions often have higher teaching loads and do not have access to significant travel funds, making it more difficult for them to attend scientific conferences.  Attendance at these conferences will allow the faculty to establish connections to other researchers and bring back the latest innovations in research and teaching to their classrooms.\r\n\r\nThe American Meteorological Society (AMS) will administer a Travel Grant program for faculty from under-resourced institutions.  AMS hosts an Annual meeting with thousands of attendees, and smaller specialty meetings throughout the year.  Faculty at ERIs, MSIs, and community colleges will be able to apply to receive funding for travel and conference registration costs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
