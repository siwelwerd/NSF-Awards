 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will provide support for early career scientists, including graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, to attend the 2023 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Chromosome Dynamics in Lucca, Italy, just prior to the corresponding Gordon Research Conference (GRC). These conferences bring together diverse scientists who study chromosome biology from different disciplinary perspectives (molecular and cellular biology, genetics, genomics, biophysics, biochemistry, evolutionary biology, among others). The research advances foundational knowledge about genome architecture, dynamics, and function, which has implications for various sectors of the bioeconomy, including biotechnology, agriculture, and medicine. The GRS serves as a forum for junior US and international scientists to present unpublished research, exchange ideas and resources, benefit from career mentoring, and build their professional network. The GRS is organized and co-chaired by a post-doctoral scholar, which serves as a notable career development experience. \r\n\r\nThe GRS and associated GRC will advance research on the mechanisms of formation, repair, and maintenance of chromosomes from molecular to organism scales and through evolution. Investigators from around the world will have the opportunity to discuss pioneering ideas and emerging technologies in the field and potentially launch new collaborations. The GRS in particular will facilitate training and professional development of a diverse group of scientists in the field of chromosome biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
