 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a conversion process to transform low-value agricultural wastes into high-value, biodegradable cellulose nanofibers. Sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based materials are needed to help combat climate change and reduce the environmental impact of greenhouse gasses.  Cellulose nanofibers are considered a versatile biomaterial for high-performance and more sustainable products across industries.  The proposed process employs green chemistry principles and may generate nanofibers that are 10 times cheaper than conventional nanofibers found in the market today. Affordable nanofibers may provide a tangible substitute for petroleum-based ingredients in products such as paints and coatings, automotive, and performance apparel and textiles. Biodegradable cellulose nanofibers may help these industries achieve their performance targets while decreasing their environmental footprint. Replacing petroleum-based materials may reduce the CO\u2082 emissions associated with their production and disposal and help reduce waste accumulation.  In addition, by using agricultural wastes as feedstock, the process will convert the atmospheric CO\u2082 captured by those plants into long-lasting, valuable biomaterials, supporting a circular bioeconomy.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a process to produce cellulose nanofibers from low-value agricultural plant wastes.  The proposed technology utilizes low-cost renewable feedstocks such as agricultural and forestry residues, harvested invasive plants, and wastes from other industries to produce the nano-sized fibrils.  The conversion process is based on mild conditions to ensure preservation of most of the starting material\u2019s components and maximum yields. In addition, the process is energy efficient as the reactions are carried out at atmospheric pressure, and employs biodegradable chemicals that do not accumulate in the environment.  Cellulose nanofibers are natural biopolymers that can replace petroleum-based materials in many applications due to their unique properties including high strength, lightweight, large surface area, oxygen barrier, thermal stability, and biodegradability.  The proposed conversion technology has been established successfully at laboratory scale and was proven robust and reproducible with a variety of feedstocks. Nanofibers produced from this process were applied in product testing by mixing with biodegradable plastic resins, which resulted in an outstanding mechanical property enhancement of the plastic material.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
