 "awd_abstract_narration": "CREST HBCU-RISE: Preparation and Characterization of Ceramics Embedded with Nanostructures for Specialized Applications \r\n\r\nWith support from the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology HBCU Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (CREST HBCU-RISE), this project aims to address energy crisis by investigating materials for energy production and energy conservation. Piezoelectric materials that generate electricity when subjected to stress, and lead-free ceramics will be investigated for this project. The project aims to develop efficient phosphor coatings for diode pumped white light generation. This will have applications to build energy efficient and robust lighting devices. The design of energy efficient materials is an ongoing global effort. The project outcomes may enhance the knowledge to build small scale piezoelectric devices with better efficiency and LED bulbs with light output similar to that produced by incandescent lightbulbs. \r\n\r\nThe project deals with preparation and characterization of glass ceramics and piezoelectric ceramics. Multi-element oxide glasses embedded with Ag and R3+ (R for rare-earth) ions will be made by the melt-quenching technique in ambient air or hydrogen atmosphere. Europium and/or Samarium doped glasses will be investigated for white light generation and optical hole burning (optical data storage) applications. R3+ -doped glasses will be investigated for optical sensing of temperature. Moreover, glass emission intensity may increase if resonance exists between Ag metallic particles and rare-earth ions which absorb 405 nm. Hence, heat treatment as well as hydrogen atmosphere will be used to induce silver metallic particles in glasses. The piezoelectric ceramic films will be fabricated from lead-free chemicals (alkali niobates and metallic titanates) by screen printing/Doctor Blading and electrospinning techniques. Ferroelectric, piezoelectric and pyroelectric coefficients of the samples will be measured to characterize them. Sample characteristics and their figures of merit will be improved by embedding them with nanostructures. These samples will be investigated for energy production, biosensing and other applications. This CREST HBCU RISE project will improve the capacity building of the university by improving the research facilities of the Physics Department and training many more minority PhD students in future, into STEM disciplines. The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology HBCU Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (CREST HBCU-RISE) program supports the expansion of institutional research capacity as well as the successful training of doctoral students, especially those from groups underrepresented in STEM at HBCUs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
