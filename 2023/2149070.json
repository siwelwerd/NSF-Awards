 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current understanding of what controls productivity in the Southern Ocean is based mostly on the scarcity of a metal compound needed for algal growth, Dissolved Iron in seawater. There is growing evidence that Manganese also plays a critical role in maintaining algal growth and if found in low concentrations can play a role in limiting primary productivity. As algal growth is a major player in absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, understanding what controls productivity increases our understanding of what role the Southern Ocean plays in the global carbon cycle. This study proposes to study the algal processes that take up Manganese in Antarctic diatoms, one of the main primary producers in the region. Another aspect will be to understand how Zinc, a micronutrient with similar dynamics than Manganese, can inhibit its uptake. The PIs propose lab experiments with cultured diatoms isolated from the Southern Ocean to obtain answers to their questions on micronutrient dynamics and will compare results from those obtained with a diatom species isolated from temperate waters. The proposed research will benefit NSF\u2019s goals of understanding life in cold environments and how they differ from other parts of the ocean. This project will support two first-time early career scientists and a female researcher in Earth Sciences. Two graduate students will also be supported, and scientific techniques used in this research will be shared at open houses sponsored by the academic institutions and with local summer schools. \r\n                                                                                                                          \r\nThis proposal represents collaborative research to explore manganese (Mn) limitation in Antarctic diatoms by two early career investigators. Diatoms are central players in the Southern Ocean carbon cycle, where the micronutrient chemistry is fundamentally different from other oceans. The Southern Ocean is characterized by widespread low Mn, coupled with high zinc (Zn). High Zn levels are potentially toxic to diatoms as Zn can competitively inhibit Mn uptake and metabolism, compromising the ability of building critical cellular components, thus impacting the biological pump. Using culture experiments with a matrix of micronutrient treatments (Mn, Zn, Fe) and irradiances, and using physiological and transcriptomic approaches, along with biochemical principles, the Principal Investigators will address the central hypothesis (diatoms from the Southern Ocean possess physiological mechanisms to low Mn/high Zn) to quantify rates of uptake and transporter binding constants.  The transcriptomics approach will help to identify candidate genes that may provide Antarctic diatoms physiological mechanisms in low Mn/high Zn environment. The project does not require fieldwork but instead would make use of culture experiments with 4 diatom species (3 Antarctic, and 1 temperate). The proposed approach will also enable the goal of developing biomarker(s) for assessing Mn stress or Zn toxicity and results from the physiological experiments will help parameterize models of micronutrient limitation in the Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
