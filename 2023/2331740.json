 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a device to deliver pharmaceutical or cosmetic dental treatments into tooth enamel.  Currently, state-of-the-art treatment to enamel relies on topical application. However, the nanoporous nature of the enamel inhibits diffusion of small molecules and pharmaceuticals, which prevents deep and rapid treatments.  The deeper and more rapid delivery of a diverse range of therapeutic molecules into the enamel, such as fluoride or potassium, could lead to better protection against tooth decay or sensitivity.  The proposed technology is designed to enhance infiltration of small molecules to provide higher efficacy and/or longer lasting dental treatments.  This may improve fluoride treatments to prevent cavities, cosmetic whitening procedures, and antibiotic delivery to treat pulpitis that would otherwise require root canal treatment.  \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a technology to induce electrokinetic flow within the nanochannels of the teeth to drive fluid flow into the dental enamel.  Electrokinetic flow is produced as a result of the electrical double layer that exists in the nanochannels of the enamel being driven by an imposed electrical field. Through application of a sufficient voltage across the dental enamel, this method allows rapid and deep infiltration of small and large, charged and uncharged molecules into the teeth.  The proposed technology may impact both preventative and cosmetic dentistry.  In addition to the delivery of fluoride and potassium treatments, the proposed technology may be used for the delivery of large and macromolecular species such as dental resins, which may expand the use case for these protecting and strengthening species on non-decayed or previously acid-etched teeth.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
