The main event is the 17th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM), which is surrounded by workshops and mentoring events, such as a doctoral symposium and a course on Analytical Observational Studies in Software Engineering where sound empirical methods are taught.  The grant provides US-based students with the opportunity to hear presentations of current research and meet the community of researchers to enhance their education and advance research goals.   The grant helps build the future workforce in software engineering practice, research and education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
