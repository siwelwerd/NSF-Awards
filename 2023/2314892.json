 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will make significant contributions to racial equity in STEM by identifying and describing forms of systemic racism inherent in mathematics teacher education programs (MTEPs). Racialized mathematics teaching practices are systemic in elementary mathematics classrooms, and the impacts of systemic inequities in K-12 mathematics education both deter students from diverse backgrounds from becoming interested in math, reducing their likelihood of engaging in STEM; and affect students\u2019 identities by devaluing or erasing their diverse cultural backgrounds and perspectives. Since teachers are the key to ensuring racial equity in classrooms, identifying racialized mathematics experiences must begin with mathematics teacher education programs. In this innovative study, a project team comprised of mathematics teacher educators of color (MTECs) will collaborate with 12-15 Preservice Teachers of Color (PTOCs), in authentic partnership, from three unique MTEPs (at an HBCU, an HSI, and a PWI) to form a cross-site Critical Mathematics Professional Learning Community (CMPLC). By documenting PTOCs\u2019 racialized mathematics experiences across three sites, the project will: (1) gather fundamental knowledge on the racialized mathematical learning and teaching experiences of PTOCs, (2) build knowledge of racialized mathematics experiences and their overall impact on the preparation of PTOCs, and (3) inform teacher education programs across content and contexts. As Black and Latinx scholars with extensive experience in teacher education, the project team conceptualized this creative project to illuminate new ways of nourishing and affirming PTOCs\u2019 racial identities and cultural strengths in mathematics teacher education.\r\n\r\nThe project team will collaborate with participating PTOCs to analyze data generated from focus groups, individual interviews, CMPLC conversations, journals, and field notes using interpretative phenomenology analysis, case study methodology, and thematic analysis. Participating PTOCs\u2019 students, especially the culturally and linguistically diverse students in their classrooms, will benefit from this project by receiving increased opportunities to learn mathematics in ways that bolster their STEM identities. The project will fill a gap in the research literature by: (1) increasing the knowledge on the mathematics teacher preparation of PTOCs; (2) centering the voices and experiences of PTOCs and mathematics teacher educators of color in a cross-racial and cross-cultural project; and (3) bringing unique perspectives to the design, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of findings about both our own experiences and those of PTOCs, as a PI team composed entirely of MTECs. By attaining a deeper understanding of PTOCs\u2019 mathematics learning experiences, we advance racial equity by exposing racist teaching practices that disadvantage historically marginalized students and identifying changes in teacher education that will identify and address practices that obstruct racial equity in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project is funded through the Racial Equity in STEM Education activity (EHR Racial Equity). The activity supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of science, technology, engineering,\r\nand mathematics (STEM) education and workforce. Awarded projects seek to center the voices, knowledge, and experiences of the individuals, communities, and institutions most impacted by systemic inequities within the STEM enterprise. This activity aligns with NSF\u2019s core value of\r\nsupporting outstanding researchers and innovative thinkers from across the Nation's diversity of demographic groups, regions, and types of organizations. Programs across EDU contribute funds to the Racial Equity activity in recognition of the alignment of its projects with the\r\ncollective research and development thrusts of the four divisions of the directorate. The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program contributed to the funding of this project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
