 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funding for the conference \u201cRecent advances in applications of Harmonic Analysis to Convex Geometry\u201d, to be held at North Dakota State University (Fargo, ND) on April 22-23, 2023. Several long-standing open problems in the area of convex geometry have recently been successfully solved using techniques from harmonic analysis. The objective of the conference is to bring together four experts in the field, who will each give a mini-course to an audience of mostly U.S. based graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. This will provide them with training in state-of-the-art methods and will open opportunities to start collaborations with more senior researchers. The majority of the funding will be used to support the participation of graduate students and early-career researchers, with priority given to women and members of other underrepresented groups. The following website will provide information about the conference: \r\nhttps://sites.google.com/ndsu.edu/recent-advances/home\r\n\r\nThe methods of Harmonic Analysis and Convex Geometry have a long history of successful interaction and have led to solutions of many long-standing problems by some of the proposed main speakers, such as the Busemann-Petty problem and, very recently, Ulam\u2019s floating body problem, which was unsolved since the 1940s. The techniques used in these recent breakthroughs are now understood to be potentially useful to solve additional open problems, in which the four proposed speakers have an extensive record of successful research. The present conference aims to provide training in these very active areas of research for U.S. early career mathematicians. There will be a poster session for graduate students to showcase their work, and a special panel on open questions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
