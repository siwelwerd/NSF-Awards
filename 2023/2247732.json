More information about this conference may be found on the conference website at https://people.math.osu.edu/penneys.2/GPOTS2023.html.\r\n\r\n\r\nGPOTS is the largest annual national conference in operator algebras and operator theory held in the United States. Since its beginning in 1981, it has grown into a major international conference with attendance approximately between 100-150 each year. Topics which will be featured at GPOTS 2023 include: C*-algebras, operator spaces, operator theory, non-commutative geometry, von Neumann algebras, and random matrix theory, with connections to many areas of mathematics, including ergodic theory, logic, and mathematical physics. Aside from plenary lectures, GPOTS 2023 will have contributed talks sessions primarily given by early career researchers, with many given by graduate students and postdocs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
