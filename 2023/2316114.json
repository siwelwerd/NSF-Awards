 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to climate warming, perennially frozen soil, or permafrost, is thawing in tundra and boreal environments. Fires are also becoming more frequent and intense in a warmer world, affecting how these landscapes exchange greenhouse gasses with the atmosphere. While previous studies have been conducted after fire, this study will provide an understanding of ecosystem function, both before and after fire at the same site. The study will take place at a greenhouse gas measuring site in a boreal forest peatland underlain by permafrost and adjacent wetlands in the Northwest Territories, Canada, that burned in October 2022. The site has a 9- year data record of carbon dioxide, methane, and water exchange between the land and the atmosphere. The study will involve a close working relationship with the \u0141\u0131\u0301\u0131\u0301dl\u0131\u0328\u0131\u0328 K\u0173\u0301\u0119\u0301 First Nation, who run the research site. \r\n\r\nThe co-impacts of permafrost thaw and fire in boreal ecosystems is poorly understood. With fires becoming more common and severe in high-latitude ecosystems, understanding the joint response of fire and permafrost thaw is vital to understanding the land-atmosphere exchange of carbon. A carbon flux monitoring site in the Northwest Territories, Canada, was burned in October 2022, presenting a rare opportunity to study pre- and post-fire fluxes over the same landscape. The investigators will rebuild the carbon flux monitoring tower to measure the land-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide and methane, and a suite of environmental measurements to understand what drives fluxes before and after fire. The investigators will collaborate  with the \u0141\u0131\u0301\u0131\u0301dl\u0131\u0328\u0131\u0328 K\u0173\u0301\u0119\u0301 First Nation, who run the research site, and the collaboration will foster a strong knowledge exchange between the scientists and the First Nations peoples.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

With permafrost thaw, understanding how fire impacts ecosystems in the permafrost region is vital to understand feedbacks from fire and permafrost thaw and how these ecosystem disturbances interact with each other. Here, we had a unique opportunity from an unfortunate even where a fire burned down and long-term research site in the Northwest Territories, Canada in October of 2022. With the funding from the NSF RAPID award, we quickly rebuilt the eddy covariance tower and published a first of its kind dataset of carbon (carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)) and energy fluxes, before and after fire and the same exact location.</p>\r\n<p>In year one of the project (2023), we successfully reestablished the eddy covariance tower at the Scotty Creek field station (Ameriflux ID: CA-SCC). Work started winter of 2023 where we quickly prepared and deployed equipment to the field and in March of 2023 we rebuilt the tower site with the help of collaborators from the University of Montreal, and the &#321;&#305;&#769;&#305;&#769;dl&#305;&#808;&#305;&#808; K&#371;&#769;&#281;&#769; First Nation (LKFN). This allows a direct comparison of ecosystem function before and after natural disturbances. A return trip was done in June of 2023 to install soil sensors that were unable to be installed below ground during the March trip when the ground was frozen.

Eddy covariance data is collected at 10Hz (10 times per second) and needs additional processing to calculate half hourly flux rates and be research ready. Data processing was done, and proper corrections and quality controls were applied before submitting the data to the Ameriflux database, managed by the United States Department of Energy. The complete post-fire dataset and additional site data (prior to 2020) can be found at the following DOI (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17190/AMF/1480303\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.17190/AMF/1480303</a>). Preliminary data analysis from the site shows intriguing results with the wetland mosaic largely keeping a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; carbon cycle despite the fire burning the surround black spruce forested areas (see figures). These wetland areas are areas where permafrost has already thawed, causing ground subsidence and wetting of the landscape. These areas were largely untouched by the fire where the in-tact permafrost peat plateaus burned.</p>\r\n<p>A manuscript comparing the long-term tower data to post fire carbon cycling is in prep in collaboration with University of Montreal, who maintained and installed the previous tower and is continuing measurements. The full dataset has 1,862 downloads since being made publicly available in 2020 and the newest version including the post-fire data has five downloads since being made available about one week ago (March 22, 2025). We&rsquo;re sure the dataset will continue to be valuable, and even more valuable now due to the unique immediate post-fire data, to the science community in addition to elucidating unique carbon cycling dynamics of these ecosystems.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/01/2025<br>\nModified by: Kyle&nbsp;A&nbsp;Arndt</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2316114/2316114_10847216_1743539230323_preandpost--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2316114/2316114_10847216_1743539230323_preandpost--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Comparison of pre and post fire fluxes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2316114/2316114_10847216_1743539230323_preandpost--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Comparison of pre and post fire fluxes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Comparisons of daily mean net ecosystem exchange (NEE) from the CA-SCC eddy covariance tower site.
