 "awd_abstract_narration": "The population of urban areas in the United States and around the world is steadily increasing. This growth poses challenges to our food, housing, energy, and water resources. A skilled and diverse group of interdisciplinary scientists that focus on urban systems is needed to address these issues and develop sustainable solutions. The Research Experiences and Mentorship in Urban Systems (REMUS) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site offers a unique opportunity for students to engage in urban science research and gain valuable skills for future careers and graduate studies. REMUS is based in Charlotte, NC, a thriving and growing metropolitan area, where undergraduate students will collaborate with scientists at the University of North Carolina Charlotte who have diverse backgrounds and training. These teams will explore various topics related to biodiversity, conservation, ecosystem restoration, environmental justice, forest health, GIS science and technology, meteorology and microclimates, stormwater management, and wastewater surveillance. Students will also receive training on best practices to conduct research and present their findings. The program\u2019s mission is to prepare the next generation of urban scientists who will contribute to solving the challenges of our changing planet.\r\n\r\nThe REMUS program is an innovative REU site designed to immerse students in the study of urban systems. Over the course of three years, each cohort will contribute to advancing our understanding of urban systems through structured one-on-one mentored research projects that encompass a social, ecological, and technological framework. Students will collaborate with mentors from diverse backgrounds to address real-world research questions within a rapidly growing metropolitan area (Charlotte, NC). Central to the program are workshops that prioritize the development of measurable student competencies and career readiness. These workshops will cover essential skills such as science communication, data management and analysis, and professional networking. The ultimate goal is to engage students in place-based discovery of familiar, yet often poorly understood urban systems within their surroundings. By participating in this program, students will acquire valuable skills relevant to career readiness including critical thinking, data analysis, and effective writing. Throughout the program, students will have numerous opportunities to enhance their science communication abilities through interactions during multiple workshops and conferences. Students will also participate in two intensive data workshops using R and GitHub. These workshops will equip students with the skills to effectively manage and analyze the data they collect. To ensure the relevance of their training, our data-focused workshops will employ publicly available data from federal, state, and local agencies, enabling students to work with real-world data that tackles pertinent and contemporary challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
