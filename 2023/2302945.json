 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Regional Innovation Engines Development Award is focused on developing an electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem within the states of Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi.  MAGNET (Mississippi Alabama Georgia Network for Electric Vehicle Technologies) will focus on growing research, economic development, and workforce development for EVs in a synergistic way so that growth of each component influences the growth of the other two components in a virtuous cycle.  The entire world is urgently focused on decarbonization to resolve the climate crisis, and the speed of transformation is beginning to generate many disparate efforts to respond in green transportation generally, and in EV technologies specifically.  Automobile companies are all transitioning from internal combustion engine production to EV production before the consumer market is ready for the transition.  Coalescence is the key to achieving order from this chaos and achieving sufficient unity of purpose to make the largest and fastest industrial transition in history.  MAGNET is about collaboration and coalescence within our service area to achieve ordered and effective growth within the region, and to serve as a model and influencer for the broader coalescence needed on a national and international basis.\r\n\r\nMAGNET will attract stakeholders within the EV industry as coalition partners: industry, universities, government organizations, economic development organizations, social services organizations, and workforce development organizations - to collaborate on building the EV ecosystem for the greater good of the region.  This coalition will provide specific measurable concerns which MAGNET will translate into use-inspired research and development initiatives.  Through this collaborative approach, industry, academia, and government will benefit from the research results which will either be integrated back into an existing industry or incubated into a new industry to support the overall health of the EV industry in the region. Workforce development will happen similarly - by bringing workforce development providers and industry together - listening and translating from needs to action by developing credentials that truly meet the needs of EV industry.  The expansion of the EV production in the region will create opportunities in traditionally underserved communities to expand both existing and new industries that are part of the EV ecosystem. The Development Award will provide support for building the team to prepare for the Engine, launching a strategic planning process, conducting engagement to increase stakeholder participation, and providing credibility to attract partners to the effort.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
