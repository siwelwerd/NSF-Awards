 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Event Horizon Telescope Science Gateway project is a collaborative effort to develop an accessible web-based portal for analyzing black hole images. Bringing together astrophysics researchers and students from the University of Arizona with technology designers, cyberinfrastructure experts, and user experience specialists from the Cyberinfrastructure Integration Research Center at the Indiana University\u2019s Pervasive Technology Institute, the project aims to create an intuitive gateway that harnesses the computational power provided by the Partnership to Advance Throughput Computing and the Open Science Grid. The gateway is built on the Apache Airavata Science Gateway framework. The user-centric design of the portal allows both experienced and novice scientists to access essential analysis tools and benefit from millions of freely available computing cycles. Beyond providing a valuable compute environment and access to untapped resources for the astrophysics community, the project serves as a case study for using science gateways to facilitate access to high-throughput computing resources, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating human-computer interaction design with science gateway technologies to simplify access to advanced computational resources.\r\n\r\nScience gateways are effective tools for expanding access to scientific cyberinfrastructure by creating user environments customized for specific scientific communities. An emerging area of research in this field involves integrating science gateway technologies with human-computer interaction and user experience design methodologies. The Event Horizon Telescope community's utilization of the Open Science Grid exemplifies this approach. This project focuses on combining human-centered design principles with science gateway technologies to address key challenges in resource provisioning, meta-scheduling, data management, and complex computing workflows in high-throughput settings. The objective is to enhance the Event Horizon Telescope community's capacity to analyze extensive astronomical datasets by providing a more user-friendly and efficient gateway. This innovative approach introduces a new perspective to astrophysics and high-throughput computing, with the potential to drive transformative advancements in both fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
