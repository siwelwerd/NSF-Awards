 "awd_abstract_narration": "Healthcare organizations have a great need for a well-trained cybersecurity workforce. The healthcare industry continues to experience high numbers of cyberattacks and data breaches and healthcare organizations have responded by strengthening their cybersecurity programs, but they continue to face significant challenges, the biggest of which is a lack of cybersecurity staff. New York City has a robust, high-paying tech workforce accounting for 7% of the total jobs in the City. Cybersecurity jobs are expected to grow significantly in the area. Thus far, African Americans, Latinos, and women have been underrepresented in the NYC tech workforce. The project team is creating a pipeline of well-trained, diverse workers prepared for frontline cybersecurity jobs in healthcare.\r\n\r\nThe project team is utilizing a sectoral partnership model to contextualize the College's existing cybersecurity training program to healthcare. Sector partnerships are regional collaboratives that bring together multiple employers within an industry to collaborate with community colleges, schools, labor, workforce agencies, community organizations, and other community stakeholders to align training with the skills needed for that industry to grow and compete. Sector partnerships have resulted in improved outcomes when compared to other forms of workforce development. The project team is documenting their cybersecurity sectoral approach in form of a how-to guide and is partnering with other local colleges to contextualize their cybersecurity training programs to other sectors such as the small business sector, non-profit sector, local government sector, and more. Thanks to the NIST cybersecurity framework, much work has already been done to differentiate the cybersecurity workforce by task. This project is adding a secondary layer of workforce specialization by industry. This specialized, sector-based training ensures that local employers have access to the cybersecurity talent they need. It also ensures that underrepresented populations have access to in-demand and lucrative cybersecurity careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
