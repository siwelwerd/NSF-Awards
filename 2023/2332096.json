 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular infrastructure at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal. \r\n\r\nThe necessity of modern sophisticated equipment is almost as great a priority as the necessity of compelling STEM instruction and research. United Tribes Technical College is installing a scanning electron microscope on its campus.  While used extensively in UTTC\u2019s instruction and research, the nearest one has been several hours away, so having one in-house significantly enhances the research and instruction in which faculty and students are immersed.  Such access has a disproportionately positive impact on the view students have of scientific inquiry and career options.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Active research on campus includes work in the fields of chemistry, biology, ecology, engineering, and environmental sciences, which are all benefiting from the SEM. The SEM is the focal point of a core microscopy lab that is being constructed as part of UTTC&rsquo;s first core facilities. Through a Research DEN (Dakota Equipment Nexus), the core facilities will provide access to research-scale equipment for the central and western parts of North Dakota and South Dakota and eastern Montana, expanding collaborations and providing services to tribal agencies. The addition of the SEM provides opportunities for UTTC undergraduate and post-baccalaureate fellows to expand their knowledge base and develop lab skills across disciplines through training. These are opportunities that would otherwise be unavailable. The project also supports increased research activity throughout the year, building on strengths in summer research programs. The SEM is installed in UTTC&rsquo;s Science &amp; Technology Center to support increasing interdisciplinary research in food, energy, and water sustainability through the Intertribal Research &amp; Resource Center along with various research topics in the Environmental Science, Fisheries &amp; Wildlife Biology, Pre-Engineering, and Sustainable Agriculture &amp; Food Systems Programs.&nbsp;A kickoff training event was held for faculty, staff, and students who imaged a white sage leaf to open discussions of the possibilities for research and outreach applications. Initial research data was collected on oxygen deficient perovskite material.
