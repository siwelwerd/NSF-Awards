 "awd_abstract_narration": "Precipitation drives the movement and storage of water in the atmosphere. It is both a source of freshwater and a driver of natural hazards that impact society. Precipitation is difficult to estimate and predict for weather, climate, and for decision making. The International Precipitation Conference was established to bring together researchers from various disciplines to identify challenges and advances in precipitation research. It is also an opportunity for scientists and engineers to develop collaborations and for early career scientists to get support and training. \r\n\r\nThe international community acknowledged the challenges in precipitation research and established the International Precipitation Conference (IPC) in 1986 to bring together the atmospheric, climate, hydrologic and applied water resources communities to discuss local, regional, and global precipitation challenges and develop collaborations that advance modeling, decision making, and prediction of resources and extreme events such as floods and droughts and their hydro-geomorphic hazards. Building on previous IPCs, this conference will bring together an international group of scientists and engineers to integrate research efforts, mentor early career scientists and students, and craft future directions in the field. The conference will engage and support early career scientists and students in a collaborative environment with pre-conference and training workshops, and fosters opportunities for future research collaborations.  \r\n\r\nThe award will be co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences, Climate and Large-Scale Dynamics, and Physical and Dynamical Meteorology programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
