 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for US participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, to attend the thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth international conferences in Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC), held at the University of California, Davis from July 17-21, 2023 and Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, in Germany from July 22-26, 2024.  The most important annual conference series in algebraic combinatorics in the world, FPSAC offers young American researchers a unique opportunity to interact closely with top mathematicians from many countries.  Each conference, which includes nine one-hour plenary lectures, thirty half-hour contributed talks, and sixty posters, will attract over 200 participants from all over the world.\r\n\r\nA distinguishing characteristic of FPSAC conferences is the concerted effort to recognize and encourage outstanding young scientists.  At least one plenary speaker is an \"emerging star,\" and talented young researchers are well represented among the speakers selected for contributed talks.  Another special feature of the FPSAC conferences is a continued tradition of inclusiveness. The conference seeks to draw substantial participation from underrepresented groups.  Furthermore, English and French have been designated as official languages for FPSAC 2023 and 2024 to promote a diverse pool of participants.  Attendance at this conference will be exceptionally valuable for graduate students and junior researchers.  Somewhat interdisciplinary, the conferences link research in combinatorics to other topics in pure mathematics such as algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, representation theory, K-theory and symplectic geometry, and to topics in other sciences such as computer science, physics, and biology.  More information can be found at http://fpsac23.math.ucdavis.edu and https://fpsac.org/confs/fpsac-2024/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
