 "awd_abstract_narration": "CISE Education and Workforce (EWF) programs aim to create equitable and inclusive opportunities for computing education and develop a diverse workforce. STARS Computing Corps, a CISE Broadening Participation in Computing Alliance, will support the 2023 CISE EWF Principal Investigator (PI) and Community Meetings. This convening will provide opportunities for the principal investigators of projects funded by CISE EWF programs to share their research outcomes, promising practices, and lessons learned. The PI meeting is intentionally co-located with the RESPECT Conference, to facilitate more engagement across research communities with shared interest in broadening participation in computing. The 2023 EWF PI meeting will also include an Aspiring PI workshop, providing guidance and insights for researchers new to EWF programs and/or NSF funding. \r\n\r\nThe 2023 CISE EWF PI and Community Meeting will be a large event for the Foundation and the computer science education research community, bringing together PIs with representatives from government, academia, and non-profit. For this event, there is a pressing need to meticulously plan and organize agenda, venue and conference logistics. This grant provides funding for the venue and logistics, including conference registration, audio visual, and meeting space for the CISE EWF PI and Community meeting and Aspiring PI workshop.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
