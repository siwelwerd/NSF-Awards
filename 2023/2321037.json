 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under-representation or historical exclusion of minorities and women in the STEM workforce, especially in computing, is contributing to the Computational and Data Science (CDS) workforce shortage. Institutions are adding data science certificates and programs as a result of student and employer demand. However, resource constraints at community colleges, Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) can impede their ability to make the necessary curriculum changes swiftly enough. The direct effect of adding more CDS courses into these institutions will allow training of a new generation of scientists, increasing the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. Creating a more diverse STEM workforce will have wider impacts including increasing public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology and increasing economic competitiveness. Training diverse scientists has another long-term effect, creating a larger pool of mentors and support for future generations of scientists.\r\n\r\nThe Computational and Data Science Exchange (CDS-Exchange) project accelerates the implementation of CDS curriculum by sharing existing courses and modules developed in the pilot project across participating institutions, thus preparing a larger number of students to undertake research or enter the workforce where such skills are in short supply for advanced cyberinfrastructure. By providing access to curriculum materials aligned with competencies for CDS education, the CDS-Exchange is empowering small and under-resourced institutions to offer undergraduate CDS curriculum, minors, and certificates with low investment. The CDS-Exchange provides access to curriculum materials that are aligned with competencies for CDS education, making it easier for faculty to teach classes with this content in the future. This network also strengthens partnerships among institutions, including HBCUs, HSIs, and PUIs, generating more opportunities for collaboration and sharing of resources and effort. The CDS-Exchange is about building a community of educators who are committed to advancing Computational and Data Science education and ensuring that students across the country have access to the skills they need to succeed in the workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
