 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Workshop on Asymptotic Analysis, to be held from October 13 to October 15, 2023 on the campus of Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis. The workshop, the eighth in a series, convenes PhD students, early-career researchers, and established mathematicians from Midwestern universities working in various areas of analysis. An important goal of the workshop is to introduce graduate students and other early-career researchers to various subfields of analysis that may not be represented at their home institutions and to promote the general dissemination of mathematical knowledge and research activity among analysts. The award provides travel support for graduate students and early-career researchers, non-local participants without other sources of support, and some of the invited speakers.\r\n\r\nTopics to be highlighted at the workshop include approximation theory, harmonic analysis, integrable systems and orthogonal polynomials, and several complex variables. The workshop is designed to bring together practitioners of these diverse research areas with the goal of promoting cross-topic discussion. This activity will result in further exchange of knowledge and the development of new collaborations. The workshop also aims to contribute to the mathematical professional development of early-career scholars across a range of fields within the discipline of mathematical analysis.\r\n\r\nWebsite: http://mwaa.math.iupui.edu\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
