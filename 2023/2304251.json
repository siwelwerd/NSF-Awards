 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is to develop a targeted biological pesticide for the control of pythium pathogens in the hydroponic greenhouse production of leafy greens. Fresh market production of tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, lettuce, and spinach is shifting to hydroponic greenhouse operations because these operations are more efficient in their use of land, water, and fertilizer than conventional operations.  Despite these advantages, pythium pathogens are a major threat to their economic viability. The accidental introduction of pythium pathogens into the recirculating water in these operations can result in complete crop losses as the pathogen spreads rapidly through the water and infects the roots causing root rots and leaf yellowing. In lettuce, root rots impair nutrient absorption and slow plant growth rates.  Crop rotation cycles must be extended to produce the same amount of product, and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of the recirculating water may be needed to mitigate disease losses.  The reduced integrity of plant roots may enable pathogenic bacteria in the water to migrate via the plant vascular system into the leaves and potentially cause disease. One such case of E. coli-contaminated lettuce has already reported. Thus, there is a need for the development of an organic-based approach for this disease problem. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will assemble a collection of pythium pathogens that reflects the genetic diversity of these pathogens in different hydroponic facilities. This collection of isolates will take into account several parameters: 1. geographic diversity, 2. crop species (arugula, basil, cannabis, lettuce, and spinach), and 3. production system e.g., deep water raft hydroponics, vertical hydroponic systems and small scale, family-owned operations.  This project will evaluate 10 Pseudomonad strains that have exhibited contact-dependent killing of all pythium strains from a smaller collection of pythium isolates to identify the most potent combinations of these biocontrol agents. A bioinformatics approach will be used to identify the genes responsible for the killing phenotype. Targeted gene deletions will be made in a sequenced strain and virulence assays of the mutated strains will be used to assess the role of specific genes. This strategy is expected to identify the genetic basis for host-specific killing of pythium species and provide evidence that these microbes are not pathogens of humans or plants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
