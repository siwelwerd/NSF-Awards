 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation project investigates the stratigraphic distribution and abundance of microplastic in the sediments of coastal wetlands. Coastal sediments have been surmised to be a significant microplastic \u201csink,\u201d but few studies have been completed on microplastic below the surface layer. Additionally, this study investigates the impacts of hurricanes on microplastic transport and burial in coastal sediments. Understanding the deposition rates of microplastic in coastal sediments is extremely important as plastic in the marine and coastal environment has been categorized as a global problem directly resulting from human activities. Data from this study can inform environmental policy-making on plastic pollution, positively influencing the health of sensitive coastal communities.\r\n\r\nInvestigating the stratigraphic signature of microplastic in coastal sediments is an emerging field of study and contributes to a better understanding of environmental pollution and estimates of microplastic abundance. This project includes field-based data collection to inform environmental modeling to produce large-scale estimates. This research will investigate (1) if rates of microplastic deposition since their initial widespread use in 1950 CE increased in line with increased production, (2) whether sediment deeper than the surface is a significant sink of microplastic, and (3) the role hurricanes play in the transport and deposition of microplastic. These topics will be addressed using sedimentological, geochemical, and micropaleontological techniques producing a full view of the prevalence of microplastic in coastal sediments. Data gathered and conclusions made from this study are of value to policy makers and other stakeholders tasked with addressing microplastic pollution in the natural world.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
