 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently, numerous start-up companies, large corporations, and government- or non-government-organization-sponsored research and pilot projects are diligently investigating the feasibility of turning carbon dioxide into carbonate minerals (carbon mineralization) as a climate mitigation strategy. Carbon dioxide can be mineralized by spreading mineral and rock powders onto croplands, forests, and oceans, injecting carbon dioxide into basalt and sedimentary aquifers, and mine tailings. Scaling-up these options globally can potentially capture and store billions of tons of carbon dioxide per year. However, as a 2021 US long-term strategy report [1] stated, techniques of \u201c\u2026 enhanced mineralization, are still in nascent stages of research and development, so the potential magnitude of reductions and the timeframes over which these technologies might deliver reductions is unknown.\u201d Currently, there are knowledge gaps in the basic science of carbon mineralization rates, the resolution of which is critical to discovering cost-effective carbon-dioxide-water-mineral interaction-based climate mitigation options. This research project meets this urgent societal need by both filling the knowledge gaps in geochemical reaction rates and mechanisms in multi-mineral systems and disseminating geochemical kinetics and modeling knowledge. \r\n\r\nTo acheive these science objectives, this project will carry out multiple isotope tracer (Si, K, Sr, Ca, Mg, Fe, K C isotopes) experiments for crushed basalts to determine the coupling of mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions. Additionally, the researchers will perform innovative geochemical simulations to interpret the experimental results using an ensemble of models and evaluate model uncertainties. To meet the broader impact objective, researchers will leverage the national computational infrastructure and internet-based delivery technologies for training a diverse workforce for a carbon-neutral economy. A geochemical modeling web portal will be built to deliver modeling tools and databases as well as virtual short courses and online lessons for thermodynamics, geochemical modeling, and kinetics. This open science approach makes geochemical sciences accessible to all regardless of socioeconomic status and encourages unselfish cooperation from all sectors and all parts of the world for achieving the common goal of meeting the challenges of global climate change.\r\n\r\n[1] US Government, \u201cThe Long-Term Strategy of the United States: Pathways to Net-Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 2050\u201d (2021); https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-Long-Term-Strategy.pdf\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
