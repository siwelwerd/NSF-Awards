 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Chicago State University to join the oVert Thematic Collection Network (TCN) as a Partner to an Existing Network (PEN).  Computed tomography (CT) scanning will be used to provide 3D data relating to structural diversity for ca. 1,700 specimens of rodents.  Rodents are among the most common but also among the most diverse mammals on the planet.  They are found in virtually every terrestrial ecosystem, with species ranging from guinea pigs, to prairie dogs, kangaroo rats, flying squirrels, capybaras, lemmings, house mice, and sewer rats.  Across this diversity, their bodies vary considerably in size and shape as they adapted to distinct habitats (e.g., Arctic tundra, grasslands, temperate and tropical forests), locomotion (e.g. terrestrial, arboreal, swimming, burrowing habits), feeding preferences (e.g., insectivores, granivores, herbivores, or generalists), and more. Given these vast differences, this project will provide 3D digitized data making it possible to examine and quantify the characters found in this radiation of diversity throughout the rodent tree of life. Undergraduate students at an MSI (Chicago State University) will be trained in CT-scan image processing\r\n\r\nThe project will generate computed tomography (CT) scans as a basis for 3D modeling of structural diversity for 1,700 specimens of rodents.  Sampling will focus on less common species.  The 3D data will be available to researchers and educators via MorphoSource.  These data will enable studies on functional quantitative characters for ecology and evolution (FuncQEE) as well as studies and lessons ranging from physiology to biomedical applications.  The project will bring together scientists and educators from Chicago State University, University of Michigan, University of New Mexico, University of Florida, and Sandia National Laboratory. Master's degree candidates and undergraduate students will receive training, including an effort to provide opportunities for underrepresented, first generation, and/or low-income students in science careers in cutting edge visualization and analytical approaches.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These species can be found on all continents on the planet (except Antarctica) and inhabit all major habitat types. These species have evolved unique traits which allow them to survive in extreme environments, including highly anthropogenically disturbed habitats (e.g., farms and cities). At the same time, many species are unique and highly vulnerable to the current changes on our planet including habitat loss and fragmentation, contamination, and climate change. Thus rodents are valuable models for ecological and evolutionary questions at many spatial and temporal scales, making large, comprehensive datasets incredibly important to understand their biology.<br /><br /></span>To meet this need, we developed FuncQEE (Functional Quantitative characters for Ecology and Evolution), a partner to the existing oVert (open Vertebrate) Thematic Collections Network, to generate novel and high-quality phenotypic data using x-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning across the global rodent tree of life. FuncQEE leveraged CT scanning of museum specimens and low price-per-scan capabilities to scale up sampling of rodent taxonomic and phenotypic diversity, and to serve this data on the web to the broader life science community, educators, and science-interested public. FuncQEE aimed to generate datasets for rare taxa that are generally not available outside of the collections housing them, while ensuring the broadest possible sampling across the ecomorphological diversity of rodents contained in US museum collections and facilitating broader interconnection between phenotypes and other specimen-derived datasets within the digitized biodiversity data ecosystem. Three-dimensional models developed from CT data will be hosted online in data repositories and remain discoverable, downloadable, and immediately usable by educators, scientists, and the general public.<br /><br />FuncQEE extends core sampling goals of the oVert-TCN (i.e., one fluid preserved individual from each rodent genus) to many additional rodent higher-level taxa including families and genera, which represent significant untapped phenotypic and ecological diversity. FuncQEE generated high-resolution and freely-available CT scans of cranial and postcranial phenotypes from across Order Rodentia, thereby laying the groundwork for broad re-use by the ecological, evolutionary, and biomedical communities. Following oVert-TCN core methodology, FuncQEE targeted fluid-preserved whole rodent specimens (&ldquo;whole phenotypes&rdquo;) for full-body scans, with a goal of 1&ndash;2 individuals per species with that preservation type. To fill major sampling gaps, we expanded this sampling strategy to species with available cleaned skeletons (but no fluid preserved specimens), thus greatly increasing the breadth of diversity sampled in this project.<br /><br />FuncQEE scanned mammal specimens from the Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH), Museum of Southwestern Biology (MSB), and the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (UMMZ). In total, we scanned 1,482 rodent specimens for the FuncQEE project. Some FuncQEE data have been published on MorphoSource (<a href=\"https://www.morphosource.org/projects/00000C889?locale=en\">https://www.morphosource.org/projects/00000C889?locale=en</a>).
