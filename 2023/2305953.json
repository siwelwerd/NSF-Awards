 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2023, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment, and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports the research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. The fellow will study what ecological conditions gave rise to the color patterns of clownfish. There are 28 species of clownfish, but only three distinct color patterns. These color patterns did not evolve from a common ancestor and instead converged on the species of anemones they live in. Although scientists have been studying the rule of life governing convergent evolution for over 100 years, we have yet to understand what ecological processes underlie the convergence of color patterns. The clownfish-anemone symbiosis provides an iconic model to test how clownfish behavior, diet, microbial community, and geographic distributions influence the convergence of their color patterns from their anemone hosts. Color patterns are compelling traits that are recognized in all ecosystems, and the project will provide the context necessary for understanding how animals evolve different color patterns. The project will broaden participation in science through public engagement and training opportunities on cutting-edge research.\r\n\r\nThe clownfish-anemone symbiosis provides a unique model for color pattern convergence as their lifestyle is primarily site attached and tailored to their environment. The symbiosis has radiated broadly, which provides opportunities for testing whether there is a geographical context that influences the color patterns of clownfish. Since clownfish are site attached, their behavior, diet, and microbiome may vary based on the species of anemones that host them and influence their color pattern convergence. Accordingly, the fellow will investigate the ecological context of color pattern convergence in clownfish using an integrative approach. The fellow will combine video analyses for behavior, stable isotope analyses for diet and trophic level, and microbiome analyses for skin, gill, and gut microbial genetics at geographically distinct areas throughout the range of clownfish-anemone symbioses. The fellow will be trained in each analysis and will pass on this invaluable training via NSF Research Experience for Undergraduate programs. Educational material will be provided to students in underrepresented and underfunded communities. The fellow will engage the public via virtual displays and \u2018Meet the Scientist\u2019 presentations at the Alabama Aquarium, schools, and other public settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
