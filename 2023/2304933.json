 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Regional Innovation Engines Development Award is focused on developing a dynamic innovation ecosystem within the tribal communities of Southern California. The Tribal Energy Innovation Accelerator (TEIA) project will systematically drive the development of clean energy technologies, businesses, and projects to accelerate the region's transformation into a sustainable and resilient economy. The TEIA ecosystem will form around the collaborative framework of the Southern California Tribal Chairman's Association (SCTCA), which since 1971 has supported Tribes with a range of programs assisting efforts to strengthen economic resilience. The TEIA region, spanning the lands of 25 SCTCA member Tribes, is poised for a transformative investment in clean energy innovation and development, given access to appropriate funding and leadership. SCTCA member Tribes bring a strong need and significant opportunity for clean energy solutions, workforce development, and economic development. They also offer unique potential to support rapid growth by hosting innovative clean energy projects - including demonstration/pilot projects and manufacturing facilities. TEIA partner organizations include SCTCA, Prosper Sustainably, Pala Band of Mission Indians, Cleantech San Diego, University of California - Riverside, University of California - San Diego, GRID Alternatives, and the Microgrid Institute.\r\n\r\nThe Regional Innovation Engines Development Award will support activities including refinement of strategies and plans, collaborative work to formalize the TEIA organization; initial staffing; outreach, engagement, and collaboration to solidify partnerships; and initiation of clean energy innovation and development activities. The project will address critical gaps affecting Tribes' access to innovative clean energy technologies and development opportunities by providing dedicated central resources, including staff and partners with full skills and knowledge to support R&D and development across the SCTCA region. TEIA's collaborative processes will facilitate gathering ideas, knowledge, methods, and expertise from core partners and collaborators in many different disciplines, technical and non-technical. This collaborative work will yield tangible translational outcomes, including innovative clean energy equipment products, resilient clean energy-producing systems, Tribal entrepreneurial businesses, and workforce development and job training services. TEIA will provide clean energy technology job training, apprenticeships, and placement assistance for candidates seeking positions in roles required for regional clean energy innovation and development - prioritizing members of Tribes and other historically excluded and disadvantaged communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
