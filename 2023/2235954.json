 "awd_abstract_narration": "Postpartum neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) parents are a widely understudied population known to be more vulnerable to adverse physical and mental health outcomes than parents of healthy infants. This Doctoral Dissertation Research project explores the biocultural pathways through which social, economic, and structural inequities are associated with stress and depression among parents with infants in an urban children\u2019s hospital NICU. These pathways, through which the effects of biology and culture impact each other, provide key context for understanding how intersectional inequities, social support resources, and access to adequate healthcare mediate differences in wellbeing among NICU parents in the United States, who are already at high risk of poor outcomes. The results of this work are shared directly with hospital leaders, nursing staff, and social workers at the study\u2019s hospital research site to contribute to discussions of how to reduce parental NICU-related stress and improve postpartum mental health outcomes. This project also supports undergraduate mentorship, interdisciplinary collaboration, and science engagement activities with the public. \r\n\r\nHaving an infant in intensive care is linked to higher rates of postpartum depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and pregnancy-related morbidities due to the increased stress associated with adverse birth outcomes and stressful postpartum environments. This project uses a comparative mixed-methods approach including parental surveys, ethnographic observations and interviews, and infant medical record data to provide a more comprehensive view of the lived experiences of postpartum NICU parents. It explores how embodied NICU-related stress and mental health vulnerabilities are mediated through social and economic inequities that can affect adequate access to maternal postpartum healthcare and social support resources. To assess postpartum NICU-related stress, the project employs a self-reported NICU-specific stress scale that allows investigators to understand how key stressors associated with the physical and social NICU environment contribute to parental postpartum stress. Assessing the relationship between the sociocultural and economic environment, contextual-specific stressors, and mental implications for postpartum NICU parents is critical not only for the health of the parent but also for their infants during early development and the health of future pregnancies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Using ethnographic methods, surveys, and medical record chart reviews, we looked at 1) how the experience of being postpartum in the NICU affects maternal physical and mental health outcomes and healthcare needs, and 2) how social and economic factors, access to postpartum healthcare, and social support affect maternal stress and postpartum depression during a NICU stay. Insights from the ethnographic component of the study help us understand how medical harm, both intential and unintentional, affects birthing persons during the postpartum period. It also speaks to understanding how these harms are not limited to maternal expereinces with their own healthcare providers but also how the NICU environment contributes to maternal health difficulties and trauma. Our results also help us understand how the way that we treat new mothers, both socially and in medicine, lends to adverse maternal health outcomes. Ethnographic interviews also helped to uncover what specific health and healthcare needs postpartum NICU parents have, and these results are being used to help inform hospital policy and practice on postpartum healthcare support, pschiatric support, and resource allocation. Study survey results have shown that there are significant disparities in postpartum healthcare access among NICU parents transferred into pediatric hospitals, and emphasize the need for pediatric hospitals to enhance their postpartum healthcare support for NICU parents. Furthermore, our survey results have demonstrated the associations of NICU-related stress, maternal social and demographic factors, and postpartum depression. These results not only inform us on the importance of addressing how the NICU environment contributes to maternal stress, but also will help us understand what parents may be at greater risk for screening positive for postpartum depression. Study survey methods and results are being used to inform the hospital fieldsite where this work was carried out on how to improve their postpartum depression screening protocols in order to help increase the ability to effectively screen all NICU parents for depression. Being able to effectively screen NICU parents will allow for the hosptial to ensure that all parents are given the mental health resources and support needed to cope with the stress of being in the NICU. Study postpartum depression screening efforts also helped participants in real-time get connected with mental health resources and psychosocial services while their child was hospitalized. Any parent who screened positive for postpartum depression was immediately referred to the psychosocial team for support. Lastly, study results are being used to inform ongoing clincial research that seeks to fill postpartum care gaps in the NICU by testing different clinical interventions aimed at providing postpartum care to NICU parents in pediatric hospital settings.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Katey&nbsp;Mari</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
