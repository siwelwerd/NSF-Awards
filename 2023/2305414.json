 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knot theory is the mathematical study of entanglement of loops up to continuous deformation. One can create a knot by taking an entangled string and connecting the endpoints, and two knots are equivalent if one can continuously deform one to the other, for example by bending, stretching, and passing strands inside and through others, but without cutting or breaking the string in any way.   This project considers both theoretical problems and applications of mathematical knot theory. One group of problems studies a family of invariants of knots related to quantum field theory from physics. More specifically, the project seeks to understand how the quantum invariant of a knot detects geometric properties of the knot and the 3-dimensional spaces that can be associated with it. The mathematical techniques from this research has potential applications to mathematical physics and theoretical topological quantum computing. Another group of problems concerns applications to the study of knotted proteins and other biopolymers, some of which are known to be associated to various diseases. The project uses knot theory techniques to develop a model that can be used to quantify and to relate local topological complexity with biophysical processes. The model can also be used to potentially design synthetic biopolymers with special biophysical properties. The project includes a number of research problems suitable for collaboration with undergraduate students, as well as outreach and dissemination activities that seek to increase interest in mathematics more generally. The PI has successfully involved undergraduate students in similar research in the past and will continue to advise and encourage students to continue careers in mathematics and related areas.   \r\n\r\nThe research is split into three parts, two seek to connect quantum topology with hyperbolic geometry and one applies knot theory to molecular biology. One project concerns a version of the Volume Conjecture based the theory of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra from quantum topology and its relationship to the Teichmuller space of a surface from hyperbolic geometry. A second project studies algebraic and geometric properties of a generalization of the Kauffman bracket algebra which is related to the decorated Teichmuller space of a surface with punctures. A third project involves a collaboration with a biophysicist to study local entanglements that are held tightly in place by molecular forces in biopolymers. The proposed knot-theoretic model would give a description of such local entanglements, allowing one to quantify and measure changes in the local topological complexity of biopolymers in experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
