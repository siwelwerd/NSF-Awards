 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current vulnerability discovery workforce consists of experts who search for software security bugs. This workforce lacks gender and socioeconomic diversity, causing inequitable access to high paying jobs, limited diversity of thought, and workforce shortages endangering Internet safety. This project aims to identify root causes of limited diversity in the vulnerability discovery community. Little research has addressed vulnerability discovery education and challenges faced by new professionals. This project is conducting studies to identify challenges faced by marginalized populations and is developing and evaluating interventions and policies grounded in these populations' experiences. This project will provide guidance to community leaders, policy makers, and educators to improve diversity, inclusivity, and equity in the vulnerability discovery workforce.\r\n \r\nTo improve community equity and inclusivity, the research team is conducting a broad survey to identify disparities among demographic groups and is interviewing leaders organizing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives to identify domain-specific decision-making challenges. The research team is conducting a community organizer workshop to discuss their findings and to collaboratively develop domain-specific guidance to address gaps and challenges in diversity initiatives. To reduced barriers to learning, the team is conducting controlled experiments with students to understand their information search processes and online resource use, and to generate and evaluate novel approaches to student educational support. Findings are to be synthesized into research-based guidelines to help educators best support a diverse group of students who would be prepared to work productively in the vulnerability discovery community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
