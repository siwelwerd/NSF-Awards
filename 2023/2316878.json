 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum science and engineering holds immense potential for transforming modern technology by offering more efficient and secure devices for computing, communication, sensing, and more. However, quantum systems often face challenges such as fragility, limited controllability, and high costs. While the search for optimal quantum platforms to address these issues is crucial, it is also strategically important to explore alternative macroscopic classical physical systems that are robust, easily controllable, and cost-effective for simulating quantum-like tasks. This LEAPS-MPS award aims to investigate analogies between microscopic quantum systems and macroscopic classical light fields, leveraging these analogies to simulate various quantum tasks. This research will advance the field of quantum simulation and classical coherence optics. Furthermore, the analogy between quantum and classical optics will contribute to the development of novel methods for teaching quantum physics, employing visualizable optical systems to enhance the efficiency of quantum education for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis LEAPS-MPS award aims to support research activities focused on simulating quantum tasks using classical light beams. This research is grounded in the emerging recognition that classical wave systems, such as classical light, share many important properties with quantum systems that are essential for quantum tasks. These properties include vector spaces, vector superpositions, coherence, entanglement, and more. By developing novel approaches to information processing within light structures, this research seeks to enhance our ability to manipulate the multi-dimensionality and multi-party nature of light in a coherent manner. The primary outcome of this project will be the establishment of new physical platforms and protocols for simulating and realizing quantum-like tasks using classical light. Leveraging the inherent advantages of classical light, such as robustness, ease of control, and low cost, this effort will pave the way for the practical implementation of quantum information science using classical analogs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
