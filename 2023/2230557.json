 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will produce a training activity about research security and, through the development thereof, will provide insight about best practices in designing, developing, and evaluating educational tools for the adult learner.  Specifically, this activity will focus on creating The Importance of Research Security, a training package with the purpose to enhance awareness and provide online training about existing and emerging risks and threats to the global research ecosystem. This project directly addresses the need to strengthen research security of U.S. government-supported research and development, per the National Security Presidential Memorandum \u2013 33 (NSPM-33).  Dissemination and use of this training will better protect U.S. research interests from both foreign and domestic risks and threats. The training module will be Internet-based, scalable, flexible, and widely accessible to researchers and stakeholders in a variety of settings, including researchers with disabilities. Training module design takes into account the end-user, being built using a design science research methodology and incorporates best practices for engaging adult learners in an online, self-paced environment. Multiple diversity factors are considered in the design, and the training materials will be Section 508 compliant. The development of the research security training module series is collaboratively funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Department of Defense (DOD).  This project is funded with a contribution from the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis research security training module focused on The Importance of Research Security will be designed and developed in consultation with a Content Expert Group, which includes experts in research security across government. Design of the training course will take an iterative design science approach, seeking to align with curriculum development and design best practices across the dimensions of topic coverage, cognitive demand, and presentation mode. The researchers will utilize a nominal process sequence for development as part of the design science research methodology. Following the initial design work and consultation, focus groups will be convened to collect training needs, topical perspectives, and insights on session length and design of the training program. Focus group meetings are held throughout to review segments are completed, determine how well the module meets design objectives, and identify necessary improvements. The project team will assess the effectiveness of the module by leveraging a cohort group to assess topic coverage, cognitive demand, and mode of presentation. Following end user testing, evaluation, and revisions to the design, the module will be made available for dissemination to research security stakeholders, including university-based researchers, undergraduate and graduate students, academic administrators, research security administrators, and researchers and staff in government agencies and national laboratories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
