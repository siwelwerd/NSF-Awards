 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a state-of-the-art micro-computer tomography (micro-CT) scanner to enhance research and education at the University of Memphis and nearby institutions. This instrument can rapidly and cost-effectively produce three-dimensional images of the porous structure inside objects without destroying or altering them. It is equipped with sophisticated software that can analyze the arrangement and distribution of pores within objects ranging from millimeters to micrometers in size. The acquisition of this instrument is strategic for the University of Memphis, directly impacting a large group of faculty members across seven science and engineering disciplines: Civil and Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Material Sciences, Physics, Chemistry, and Earth Sciences. Through the acquisition of the instrument, the University of Memphis will be able to establish a cross-institutional collaboration network, connecting researchers from the University of Memphis with neighboring institutions and industrial companies in Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Missouri, including the University of Mississippi, Arkansas Tech University, University of Alabama, University of Missouri, LeMoyne-Owen College, Union College, and Rhodes College. This instrument will also contribute to the advancement and modernization of curricula for both undergraduate and graduate students. It will enable training of globally competitive workers capable of conducting advanced micro-CT investigations and designs required by several modern industries. In addition to benefiting graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, this instrument will expand mentoring opportunities for undergraduate students, specifically underrepresented minorities and those with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThis micro-CT instrument will enable large group of faculty members to conduct fundamental and applied research in multiple areas of science and engineering, such as investigating (a) impacts of emerging microplastic pollution on soil-water dynamics, (b) bone and tissue healing using biomaterials, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine engineering, (c) biofilm structure and biomaterial modifications to decrease biofilm formation, (d) additive manufacturing of low-modulus metallic alloys, (e) defect-strength relationship, fatigue and fracture of additive manufactured metals, (f) hierarchical transition metal-oxide-based supercapacitors, (g) 3D-printed hydrogel scaffolds for drug delivery, (h) soil pore microstructure influence on soil CO2 cycling, (i) soil cracking and healing dynamics under varying climate condition, (j) dispersion state of graphene nanoplatelets in thermoplastic and thermoset polymers, (k) numerical modeling of fracture in human bone structure due to osteoporosis, and (l) biofilm accumulation on plastic plumbing materials and interactions with heavy metals. This instrument will significantly increase research quality and productivity, enable new research areas, and enhance the educational commitment of the University of Memphis and the regional institutions.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Instrumentation Research Program (MRI) and the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology Program (BMMB) in the division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
