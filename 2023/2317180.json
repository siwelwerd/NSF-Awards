 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of technology applied to the ever-growing sectors of consumer products, transportation, and biomedical devices that rely on portable and flexible power. The lithium-ion battery market has already reached a valuation of $44 billion in 2021, driven by both consumer demand and government legislature. This project seeks to offer a step forward via battery components that are safer than conventional batteries in that they are immune to explosions and fires, offer flexible properties, and all the while improve performance (e.g., electric vehicle driving range). \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of technology that improves both the performance and safety of current lithium-ion batteries. The unique mechanical and ionic conductivity properties of the technology\u2019s porous, inflammable, composite nano- and micro- structures will improve the lifetime and capacity of batteries produced by electric vehicle and electric vehicle battery manufacturers, increase manufacturing due to reduced testing requirements, and remove risks of fire and explosion associated with current battery electrolyte technologies. By marrying the advantages of polymer materials (mechanical robustness, hierarchical nano- and micro-structures, scalable solution processing) with those of ceramics (improved conductivity and electrochemical stability), a state-of-the-art porous material is produced that is tougher than Kevlar with simultaneous ion transport capabilities. In the context of batteries, this material has shown higher energy densities, longer cycle life, and unprecedented safety compared to current liquid electrolyte-based lithium batteries that are known to pose significant fire and chemical risks. Furthermore, effective dendrite resistance, ultra-high ion transport, and electrochemical stability of the materials supports the improved performance and overall impact of the novel product.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
