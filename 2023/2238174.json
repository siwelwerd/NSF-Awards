 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current research suggests that undergraduate science students are engaging in ineffective communication regarding culturally controversial science topics. This ineffective communication can exacerbate divides between science and society. Unfortunately, most students do not receive proper instruction on how to communicate these topics in a productive manner, despite the significance of science communication as a crucial skill for undergraduate students to acquire. One of the challenges in addressing this issue is the absence of comprehensive evaluation methods, instructional frameworks, and materials to enhance students' communication abilities. This project seeks to serve the national interest and address this gap by developing evidence-based practices and instructional materials that teach undergraduate students studying biological sciences the principles of science communication and how to apply them when discussing culturally controversial science topics. By improving students' communication skills, this project seeks to enhance their impact as future scientists, science educators, and healthcare providers, ultimately fostering improved relations between science and society through more effective science communication.\r\n\r\nThis project housed at Middle Tennessee State University will create the materials needed to advance undergraduate science communication education about Culturally Controversial Science Topics (CCSTs). Using the frameworks of cultural competence and expectancy value theory as well as the guiding principles of science communication, the specific objectives of the project are to (1) develop survey instruments to measure student communication education outcomes, (2) establish an evidence-based instructional framework with a set of best practices for CCST communication education, and (3) design evidence-based instructional materials for science instructors to use to improve undergraduates' CCST communication outcomes. To accomplish the objectives, the project team will build, pilot, and gather validity evidence for survey instruments that can be used to assess student confidence, knowledge, and ability communicating about CCSTs. Once instruments have been developed and validity evidence gathered for the measures, researchers will use the measures to assess the current CCST communication education outcomes of undergraduate students who are learning about CCSTs in 50 biology classes across the United States. To build an evidence based instructional framework, researchers will use triangulation methodology to identify best practices for teaching CCST communication. Researchers will use data from their observations of current instructional practices, interviews with students and instructors, and prior published science communication education literature to identify effective CCST communication education practices. Using the new framework, researchers will then design lessons to enhance students' CCST communication knowledge, confidence, and abilities and then use the new survey instruments to evaluate the lessons in undergraduate science classes. Further, researchers will facilitate a Course-based Research Experience (CRE) for students who will work on projects related to the data gathered for the CSST research. The success of the project will be assessed by the production and publication of the instruments, framework, and lessons that are shown to lead to better student communication outcomes. Additionally, an expert advisory board will review the project products and evaluate the evidence for their efficacy across different student groups. The results of the project will be disseminated through publications in peer reviewed science and science education journals as well as presentations at science and science education conferences. The research team will also create talks and infographics that describe the results of the study to be posted on media and social media platforms. This project has the potential to advance the field of science communication education by specifically addressing student communication about CCSTs, for which there is currently very little research. Ultimately, this project has the potential to help mitigate public polarization about CCSTs by training more of our future scientists to communicate more productively. The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that supports early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education. This CAREER project is supported by NSF's Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
