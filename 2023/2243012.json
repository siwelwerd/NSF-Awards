 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need for highly effective science and mathematics teachers by supporting the academic research and professional development of pre-service teachers who will convey understanding and excitement of conducting basic scientific research to their students. In this project, prospective science and mathematics teachers will experience authentic research methods through work as a member of STEM laboratory research teams. These STEM majors will be better equipped to incorporate research and other inquiry-based learning into their future classrooms. They will also participate in professional development activities to gain pedagogical content knowledge and to learn best practices for engaging secondary school students in authentic research experiences.\r\n\r\nThe project at Alabama A&M University will provide research opportunities for pre-service secondary STEM teachers, many of whom may be from groups underrepresented in STEM, in exciting and relevant topics in Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics. The research experiences will occur over eight-weeks, through a summer program each year for three years. Twenty-four talented pre-service secondary teachers will be recruited, primarily from seven partner institutions in Alabama: Alabama A&M University, University of Alabama in Huntsville, University of Alabama in Birmingham, University of West Alabama, Alabama State University, Oakwood University, and Miles College. Participating students will be actively engaged in cutting-edge research under the direct supervision of dedicated, experienced faculty mentors. Additionally, each week two hours will be set aside for professional development training that will foster connections to teaching. This project will help to remedy the shortage of high-quality and research-experienced science and mathematics teachers. Through its evaluation, the project will generate knowledge about the impact of research on teachers' content knowledge and teaching. This Noyce Research Experiences for pre-service teachers project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need districts. It also supports research on the retention and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
