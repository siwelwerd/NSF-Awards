 "awd_abstract_narration": "The life sciences comprise the largest and most diverse field within STEM higher education. Biology education programs in colleges and universities across the country are tasked with preparing a diverse workforce equipped to understand life on our planet and apply lessons learned to produce societal benefits and tackle societal challenges. Yet, biology education research, which can be used to inform and improve biology teaching and learning, is still developing as a field. Furthermore, biology education research has been critiqued for its insular approach, limited study designs, and insufficient attention to principles of measurement. All of these issues compromise the utility of biology education research findings. This project is designed to address this concern and build capacity for robust and theory-informed research by developing, implementing, and evaluating a novel model for postdoctoral training in biology education research. The project uses a co-mentorship approach that leverages expertise and ongoing cross-disciplinary research collaborations among life science and social science faculty members at the University of Georgia. Participating Postdoctoral Fellows select and carry out a defined research project to advance their research expertise. In addition, fellows formulate an independent research project they will take with them into their next position. Fellows also engage in a tailored suite of professional development activities that prepare them for a diversity of positions related to higher education. All aspects of the project are grounded in research on effective ways to recruit, select, and mentor early career researchers in order to maximize the project\u2019s success and impact.\r\n\r\nThis project is designed to prepare a diverse cohort of Postdoctoral Fellows to carry out biology education research that generates robust empirical findings, catalyzes theory development, and broadens participation in biology education. The project is designed to recruit and identify the cohort using a series evidence-based approaches, including situational interviews and selection rubrics, to broaden participation and limit potential influences of implicit biases. Fellows select and carry out a defined research project to advance their research expertise and formulate an independent research project they will take with them into their next position. A pair of faculty co-mentors\u2014one in the life sciences and one in the social sciences support fellows in their research. Fellows further their professional development through a suite of individual and cohort-based activities, including literature reading and analysis, seminars and networking with leading scholars, presenting at national conferences, writing and submitting manuscripts and grant proposals, and applying for jobs that align with their career goals. PIs and research mentors work are grounded in principles of job crafting and effective, culturally aware mentorship such that each Fellow formulates and enacts an individual development plan tailored to their needs, interests, and aspirations. Fellows also have a \u201cmenu\u201d of other options from which they can craft their plans, including research-related courses and workshops, professional certifications, and teaching and mentoring opportunities. The project goals include increasing diversity of the biology education research community, building capacity to carry out robust, theoretically informed, and completing impactful research that leads to mechanistic understanding of biology education and theory building related to all levels of the biology education ecosystem (e.g., learning, teaching, policy, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by NSF\u2019s STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) Program with co-funding from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) and the EDU Core Research (EDU ECR) Programs. The STEM Ed PRF Program aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied research that advances knowledge within the field. The IUSE Program supports projects to improve STEM teaching and learning for undergraduate students, including studying what works and for whom and how to transform institutions to adopt successful practices in STEM education. The EDU ECR Program supports research on STEM education in one or more of three research areas: STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
