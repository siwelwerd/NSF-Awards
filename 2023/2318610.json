 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific research is vital for technological advancements in firms, yet the commercial utilization of scientific knowledge faces significant challenges. Despite the availability of scientific knowledge, it often remains trapped in the ivory tower, if it is ever applied commercially. This project focuses on the diffusion of scientific information to firms, and the barrier created by the complexity of scientific papers tailored for experts. This complexity hampers comprehension and effective utilization by non-experts and the public. Simplifying scientific information and communicating it to a broader audience can potentially enhance the commercial diffusion of science. To explore this, the researchers investigate the role of media coverage (supported by scientific press releases), which have been underemphasized in the literature on the commercialization of science.\r\n\r\nThe project addresses three key research questions: (a) What is the causal impact of media coverage on driving commercialization, and to what extent? (b) Which types of scientists and firms benefit from media coverage? and (c) What are the mechanisms through which scientific media coverage drives commercial diffusion? To answer these questions, the researchers have compiled a unique dataset that matches scientific press releases from over 100 US research institutions with scientific articles in the field of biology and patent-to-paper citations related to commercial applications. They employ an innovative research design for causal inference, leveraging capacity constraints at university press information offices to generate random variation in press release likelihood for articles of similar quality. By examining how and when media coverage can facilitate diffusion, this project will contribute valuable insights to addressing the challenge of limited scientific commercialization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
