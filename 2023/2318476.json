 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is the National Science Foundation\u2019s most prestigious award for early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and to lead advances in the mission of their department or organization. Early-career faculty often face challenges in proposal writing, and they often have limited experience interacting with NSF program directors. To address these challenges, this project will fund the annual CISE CAREER Proposal Writing Workshop in 2023, 2024, and 2025, aiming each year for conference facilities at or close to the NSF headquarters in Alexandria, VA.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the workshop is to provide guidance and support to early-career faculty members who are planning to apply for the NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award. The workshop aims to help these individuals in developing successful research and education plans, to provide a platform for meeting with NSF program directors, and to offer networking opportunities for exchanging ideas with other early-career CISE faculty members. Each year, the workshop expects about 250 CAREER-eligible junior faculty in NSF-supported disciplines at U.S. universities and colleges to attend. Preferences will be given to junior faculty in CISE-related disciplines, with travel support for participants from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), from minority-serving institutions (MSIs), women, members of underrepresented minority groups, and persons with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
