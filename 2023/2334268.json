 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an ExpandAI Capacity building pilot (CAP), which focuses on establishing and growing AI related activities at Texas State University - San Marcos. This project aims to significantly expand access to AI education, infrastructure, and research opportunities through widespread integration of AI technology into non-AI disciplines such as criminal justice, psychology, firefighting and agriculture. By leveraging the collective expertise and resources of the team, the project will promote interdisciplinary research and education to grow a diverse pool of AI practitioners that will drive sustainable expansion of AI technology across the Texas State University San Marcos campus and in the nearby community. Led by a diverse team of researchers from various academic departments, the project will catalyze institutional change at Texas State University San Marcos by providing comprehensive training to underrepresented individuals, empowering them to pursue AI-related careers thereby enriching the field with diverse perspectives.\r\n\r\nThe proposal describes a four-pronged approach to AI-related institutional transformation at Texas State University San Marcos: (i) enhancing instructional and curricular capacity by developing innovative models for teaching and learning using AI; (ii) improving the efficiency of AI research by providing high-performance computing training that will speed up data pre-processing and neural network training; (iii) investing in foundational and use-inspired AI research and (iv) workforce development initiatives for individuals traditionally underserved in AI. Curriculum development initiatives include the establishment of an Applied AI Summer School and the development of several new AI-related course modules in areas such as Data Analytics, Python programming, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Evidence-based pedagogical approaches - such as inclusive pedagogy, reflective practices and contextualization \u2013 will be employed to support student learning. In collaboration with the Texas State University San Marcos Center for Analytics and Data Science, this project will establish an inclusive AI ecosystem and promote interdisciplinary collaboration, driving groundbreaking research in use-inspired AI. The ExpandAI Program supports AI-powered education and workforce development, infrastructure and research at Minority Serving Institutions to strengthen and diversify U.S. research and education pathways and provide historically marginalized communities with new opportunities in STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
