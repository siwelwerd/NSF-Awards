 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measurements of the Earth's magnetic field are used to understand how Solar activity affects the Earth. During periods of high activity, the magnetic field changes rapidly, which can cause damage to power grids, interference with communication and navigation satellites, and disruption of air traffic. The data obtained from the MagStar magnetometer array inform research into the multiple scientific domains supporting end-users in each sector. The array also provides real-time data to various power utility partners and independent system operators (ISOs) for hazard awareness and the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center. It is one of only two currently operating scientific-grade magnetometer arrays in the contiguous United States.\r\n\r\nThe MagStar project, originally funded through the NSF Distributed Array of Small Instruments (DASI) grant NSF-193304, has successfully deployed 13 real-time operational magnetometers in observational gaps across the contiguous United States. The data are provided in real-time (less than 1 second), at high-quality for research and operations (0.1nT resolution), and up-time/data capture at most locations exceeds 99%. As we head into solar maximum conditions and geomagnetic activity increases, the research efforts that MagStar supports will become increasingly more prevalent. It is important that continuity of these data streams is maintained through this high-activity period of the solar cycle. The next phase of this project will support long-term data availability for scientific use by continuing to maintain and operate the array for two years, including developing better support for data transfer to the SuperMag and Madrigal databases for ease of public access, and maintaining real-time data transfer to users through the existing API.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
