 "awd_abstract_narration": "The provided support will enable United States-based students to attend and participate in the 39th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2023). This conference will take place in Anaheim, California, USA from April 3 2023 to April 7, 2023. The ICDE 2023 conference is a premier international technical event centered on various aspects of database research and practice. It provides a forum that promotes students and researchers to identify scientific foundations for building large-scale database management systems that can work ever more effectively. Efforts will be made to broaden the participation of underrepresented students and researchers. The conference will thus contribute directly to training the next generation of scientists who are both consumers and developers of technology in database management system design and implementation. The involvement of United States-based students will have a direct impact in creating a highly-qualified workforce that can take on the emerging data science challenges of the future.\r\n\r\nDatabase research profoundly influences many domains of societal importance including health sciences, the field of Internet of Things (IoT), service-oriented computing, real-time business analytics, and social computing. The ICDE 2023 conference provides researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government agencies with an excellent opportunity to share their research and experiences on all aspects of data management and analysis at scale. The aims of the conference are multi-fold: (1) to provide an international forum for sharing research results addressing major challenges in next-generation database research; (2) to stimulate interactive discussions on research in the database area through panels, posters, tutorials, and student scholar roundtables; and (3) to motivate and engage future generations of researchers via the many conference and workshop presentations, interactive poster sessions, and panel and breakout sessions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In making the selection, the organizers took into account funding availability from other sources, as well as diversity of students supported in order to increase diversity of student participants. The travel grant enabled the students to travel to Anaheim, CA to participate in the conference and its associated workshops. The funding was used primarily to defray the costs of registration, travel, and lodging for the students. The travel grant enabled a life-enriching experience for these students, giving them a taste for the research environment in both academic and industrial circles around the world. The students also participated as volunteers to contribute to the organization of the conference and workshops. This experience was especially valuable since it&rsquo;s the first in-person ICDE conference after the pandemic. Attending ICDE enabled students to present their research to a broad audience, to develop contacts with other researchers in academia and industry working in related areas, to seek internship opportunities, to explore job prospects, to develop collaborations, and so on. The supported recipients expressed strong gratitude to NSF highlighting the important role that the NSF travel support played in their career.</span></span></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified:
