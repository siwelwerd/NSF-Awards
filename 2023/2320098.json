 "awd_abstract_narration": "This MRI proposal seeks acquisition of an electron-beam lithography (EBL) system to support education and research at the University of New Mexico (UNM) and surrounding regions. UNM is a Carnegie R1, Minority-Serving Institution with a student body that is approximately 50% Hispanic and 12% American Indian, and this proposal leverages this unique environment to train students from historically underrepresented backgrounds in EBL and its applications. The EBL system will be installed at the Center for High Technology Materials (CHTM), a center with a 40-year record of leadership in photonics and semiconductor research that serves a broad range of internal and external researchers.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nNanofabricated devices are at the heart of numerous fields of science and engineering, ranging from photonics to biochemistry and quantum technologies. EBL is the workhorse tool in nanofabrication, and regular access to high-quality EBL is a requirement for many nanoscience research projects. At UNM, over fifteen PIs in multiple disciplines (e.g.,  Electrical, Mechanical, Chemical Engineering, Physics, and Chemistry) use EBL. In quantum technology, UNM researchers use EBL-defined devices to build a fundamental understanding of the potential, scalability, and limits of quantum devices. In nanophotonics, EBL enables UNM research in areas from molecular chemistry to solar cell engineering. In nanomechanics, UNM researchers use EBL in developing new imaging, sensing, and lithography techniques. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe EBL system will be used to provide training to graduate students in EBL-enabled research. EBL is also being integrated into UNM undergraduate nanophotonics and nano-electronics courses. The EBL system provides students with advanced technical workforce training for academia, national labs, and the semiconductor, photonics, and quantum technology industries. Additionally, the co-PIs host the QU-REACH program, a summer research experience in Quantum Technology for New Mexico undergraduates, with a diverse student intake. Integrating EBL into this effort will enhance the participants' recruitment prospects and training experience. CHTM also hosts year-long service learning experiences and summer workshops for high school students and teachers, mostly from economically disadvantaged schools in Albuquerque. These students and teachers will participate in EBL-enabled research and observe the tool in action.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
