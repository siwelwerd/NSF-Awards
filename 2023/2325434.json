 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to bring a novel and safe contrast agent platform for photoacoustic imaging that will be of benefit for multiple biomedical imaging applications. This technology would significantly increase the depth of imaging currently accessible with traditional contrast agent, limit the safety risk, enhance the quality and contrast of photoacoustic imaging and increase the targeting specificity to stain tissues and organs with higher precision. The applications impacted by this novel technology include but are not limited to preclinical imaging for better assessment of biological mechanisms happening in deep tissues, clinical imaging for more accurate and faster cancer diagnosis, lymph node staining, and tumor margin staining to help surgeons remove tumors more efficiently. In addition, the scalability and versatility of this novel contrast agent platform would reduce the cost associated with biomedical imaging and would facilitate access to clinical diagnostic imaging for many patients with limited resources.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a novel, easy to synthesize, size-tunable and targeted contrast agent platform for photoacoustic imaging that can potentially solve unmet imaging needs in preclinical and clinical markets. This platform is composed of a highly organized molecular arrangement of biocompatible dyes offering a high optical absorption in the near-infrared range aiding in deep-tissue imaging. This platform does not require any nanocarriers to be assembled, which increases its safety profile, reduces the number of components to facilitate clinical translation. The size of the contrast agent can be controlled without changing the composition or the optical properties using scalable and reproducible synthesis methods which broadens its use in biomedical imaging. It also offers significant advantages in comparison with traditional clinically used contrast agents that are usually not targeted and thus offer limited specificity. The platform offers long-term storage capability using conventional storage methods without any change in its optical and physical properties, which will eventually aid its manufacturability and distribution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
