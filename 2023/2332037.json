This will significantly contribute to increasing the diversity of individuals with a doctoral degree in data science and AI/ML prepared for both industry and academics careers. The cutting-edge research conducted for their doctoral degrees will advance our knowledge in key areas important to the nation and society.\r\n\r\nThis project has four objectives: (1) enhance research infrastructure by upgrading the MMC data center with high-performance computing and networking capabilities; (2) establish a new Doctorate degree program in Data Science at MMC; (3) recruit high caliber faculty and scientists with expertise in AI/ML and data science research; and (4) increase the number of students from underrepresented minorities and women who attain a Doctorate in data science. The project will enroll twelve students into the new PhD program in data science in two cohorts of six students each. The knowledge gained from this project will be disseminated broadly to a community of scientists and engineers. The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology HBCU Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (CREST HBCU-RISE) program supports the expansion of institutional research capacity as well as the successful training of doctoral students, especially those from groups underrepresented in STEM at HBCUs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
