 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rising sea levels impact coastal ecosystems and communities around the world. One of the most important factors influencing sea level rise locally is the vertical movement of the land surface. These adjustments can be caused by the growth and decay of glaciers and ice sheets which are often located thousands of kilometers away. A better understanding of this ice-land interaction\u2014termed glacial isostatic adjustment\u2014can improve predictions of future sea-level rise. This study will map and date shoreline deposits along the Eastern Shore of Virginia that were formed over the last ~120,000 years. The focus is on times when sea level was near to, or higher than present. These data will inform modeling of glacial isostatic adjustment and ice-sheet changes to better quantify the history of global ice sheet growth and decay. This research will address questions surrounding past regional sea-level and ice-sheet changes over the last glacial period. The work may also improve projections of the effect of glacial isostatic adjustment on regional sea-level rise into the future. Additionally, this project will support collaboration between the scientists and the non-profit Barrier Islands Center in Machipongo, Virginia. The collaboration will combine the geological results from the science team with local community knowledge of the region. This work will develop museum exhibits focused on the geology and physical history of the Virginia Eastern Shore. \r\n\r\nGlobal variations in ice volume through the last glacial cycle are a direct and sensitive measure of ice age climate change. However, regional (relative) sea level is controlled by a suite of local factors, primary among which is glacial isostatic adjustment. Significant uncertainty in the history of sea-level changes during the last glacial cycle\u2014and the role of glacial isostatic adjustment in those\u2014highlights the need for high-quality and well-dated sea-level markers across the ice-sheet growth phase (120,000 to 26,000 years ago). Mid-field sea-level observations (along the peripheral bulge of ice sheets) have the potential to bridge gaps in understanding between global sea level and local continental ice-sheet behavior, since relative sea level at these locations is sensitive to changes in the volume and extent in nearby ice sheets, as well as globally averaged sea-level changes. Focusing on the mid-field Eastern Shore of Virginia (USA), this study will first analyze high-resolution topographic and subsurface mapping data, assign indicative meanings to associated preserved Pleistocene coastal deposits, and develop a comprehensive geochronology to create a robust local, mid-field sea-level record over the period of growth of the last ice sheet. We will then perform state-of-the-art sea-level simulations using a range of possible ice-loading histories, which span the range of uncertainty on global mean sea level and ice-sheet geometries in order to gain insight into North American ice-sheet dynamics over this time period. In doing so, this study will better quantify the history of global ice sheet growth and decay and improve understanding of linkages between climate forcings and ice-sheet dynamics, with associated impacts on global eustatic, and mid-field relative sea level.  Furthermore, this work will support the career development of 2 PhD students and an early-career PI, and mentor two undergraduate student research projects. The project will enable a collaboration with the non-profit Barrier Islands Center to engage the local community to share experiential knowledge to help create a museum exhibit.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
