 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Oakwood College seeks to create a transferable model for growing STEM enrollment in lower division coursework and to, more effectively, retain and guide traditionally underrepresented students into STEM degree programs and careers. Specifically, two undergraduate Biology laboratory courses will undergo curricular enhancements and implement pedagogical interventions to integrate innovative microbial host-interaction and molecular genetics research. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project hypothesizes that innovative research into the laboratory curricula will improve the quality of undergraduate STEM education at Oakwood College by: (1) improving students\u2019 critical-thinking and scientific reasoning skills; (2) increasing retention and 4-year completion rates of biology majors; and (3) bolstering the competitiveness of undergraduate students for graduate school. The overall approach will be implemented in four phases: (1) research summer bridge, (2) research experiences in General Microbiology laboratory, (3) research experiences in Genetics laboratory, and (4), peer research leadership development (summer and academic year) and research dissemination. This project has the potential to positively impact the retention and recruitment of underrepresented students in STEM fields at two major transition points. First, it may improve the research experience for undergraduates demonstrating the relevance and applicability of biological sciences. Secondly, it will provide hands-on, problem-based learning experiences that may lead to increased competitiveness for undergraduate student researchers for STEM careers and graduate studies. It is anticipated that the project will demonstrate the efficacy of the two targeted lab courses for improving student learning related to biological sciences and provide an evidence base demonstrating whether this approach is feasible and effective in undergraduate education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
