 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) is a top-tier venue for quick and wide dissemination of cutting-edge research results in computer security applications. The conference achieves this by hosting several technical sessions, workshops, training sessions, keynotes by distinguished speakers, artifacts competition, case studies, panels, national interest discussions, work-in-progress talks, and poster sessions. The 2022 ACSAC conference consists of approximately 73 technical papers across a wide spectrum of computer security and privacy domains. The hard topic theme of the 2022 conference is \"Trustworthy Systems.\" The conference's broader significance and importance are reflected in its agenda, which explores some of the most intriguing and pressing challenges in the discipline, highlighting open avenues for further work in these areas. Participation in the conference is thus a valuable opportunity to students and is an important part of graduate education in cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nThis award provides travel support to encourage participation in the 2022 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field as demonstrated by statement of research, curriculum vitae (CV) showing research output, coursework and/or project experience, and a letter of recommendation from a research adviser or faculty member confirming that the student is in good standing plus a justification of financial need. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Run by the Applied Computer Security Associates (ACSA), it brings together the foremost minds in academia, industry, and government to address the most pressing problems in applied computer security, as well as discuss seminal works in information security. ACSAC is a highly competitive, peer-reviewed conference. The conference program consists of two days of pre-conference workshops and three days of keynote talks, technical paper sessions, panels, a &ldquo;works-in-progress&rdquo; session, and a poster session.<br /><br />The NSF Student Travel Grant for ACSAC 2022 provided conference registration fees and travel support for U.S.-based undergraduate and graduate students to attend the ACSAC conference held in Austin, Texas on December 5-9, 2022. Moreover, due to a no-cost extension, this grant also provided conference registration fees and travel support for U.S.-based undergraduate and graduate students to attend the same conference held in Austin, Texas on December 4-8, 2023 (ACSAC 2023). A complete description of the conferences can be found on the ACSAC website at https://www.acsac.org/2022/ and https://www.acsac.org/2023/, and a copy of the full programs can be found at https://www.acsac.org/2022/program/final/ and https://www.acsac.org/2023/program/final/.<br /><br />NSF student funding supported registration fees and a portion of travel costs for students from U.S. educational institutions. Separate funding from ACSA supported registration fees and a portion of travel costs for additional students from U.S. educational institutions, students from international institutions, and recipients of Scholarships for Women Studying Information Security (SWSIS), which provides assistance to women studying for their bachelor's or master's degrees in fields relating to information security. ACSAC provided discounted registration fees to all students.<br /><br />The attached table provides overall statistics on ACSAC 2022 and 2023 attendance, technical papers, and supported students, including degrees pursued, active roles in the conference, women, and members of underrepresented groups.<br /><br />A key goal of the project is to provide opportunities for student education, as well as training and professional development. Students participating in the conference gained valuable insight into current research. A number of students shared their research with other conference participants by presenting technical papers and/or posters. Professional/academic attendees learned from the students (and each other), and made connections that could lead to future employment. The distinguished practitioner keynote speeches gave conference attendees, including students, leading experts&rsquo; perspective on applying security to difficult technical problems. Similarly, the workshops offered conference attendees, including students, a diverse set of classes in key topics areas such as program analysis and system verification, industrial control system security, security of blockchain systems, and insider threats. The TracerFIRE workshop is an interactive, group-based forensic and incident response exercise that covers incident response, forensic investigation, and live analysis on file system, memory, and malware.<br /><br />ACSAC is committed to increasing the quality and quantity of students, including members of underrepresented groups and women, in cybersecurity education and ultimately the cybersecurity profession. In addition to announcing the availability of student conferenceships to attend ACSAC on our website, we proactively worked to recruit members of underrepresented groups and women from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU's), national societies and associations that represent students and professionals from underrepresented groups and women, universities in Austin, Texas, and the Scholarships for Women Studying Information Security (SWSIS) program.<br /><br />The ACSAC conference is widely publicized and open to all members of the international information security community. The complete ACSAC proceedings, including all technical papers and papers from the invited essayist and distinguished practitioner keynotes, were published by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and are available via the ACM Digital Library at https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3564625 and https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3627106.
