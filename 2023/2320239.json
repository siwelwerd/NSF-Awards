 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. The University of Nebraska \u2013 Lincoln is acquiring an instrumental platform that combines the chemical separation methods of size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and field-flow fractionation (FFF) with the detection methods of multi-angle light scattering and dynamic light scattering (MALS-DLS) to support the research of Professor David S. Hage, Chin Li (Barry) Cheung, Edward Harris, Wei Niu, and Angela K. Pannier. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of chemistry, biochemistry, chemical and biomolecular engineering, and biological systems engineering at this institution. SEC separates molecules as a function of size based on their elution from a packed column. FFF is a versatile separation technique that can be applied to macromolecules and nanoparticles. MALS-DLS are subsequently used, in-line, to measure time-dependent fluctuations in scattered light, which is related to molecular diffusion coefficients and their size distributions. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions. The instrument is leveraged in research training opportunities that impacts many areas spanning from nanomaterials and polymers to biomedical research and environmental studies. Students, local industry and others gain hands-on experience with the instrument through its integration in various program.\r\n\r\nThe award of the SEC/FFF-MALS-DLS is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as chemistry, polymer science, biochemistry, chemical and biomolecular engineering, and biological systems engineering. Research focuses on environmental and chemical research aimed at examining the activity of pharmaceuticals in water and their binding with dissolved organic matter, as well as the characterization of new methods for the degradation of nanoplastics and microplastics in water. The instrument is also used to isolate size-specific forms of the complex carbohydrate hyaluronan for examining their biological activities, to characterize and separate recombinant proteins and their domains for enzyme engineering, and to isolate and characterize synthetic nanoparticles and biological vesicles for use in biomedical research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
