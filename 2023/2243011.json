 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Earth\u2019s climate changes present a challenge to astronomical observations. Astronomers understand the science of climate change and interact with a wide audience. The investigators will provide education materials for astronomers, such as videos or lesson plans, to communicate climate change and its impacts effectively.  The investigators will also work to improve resources that have already been developed. The materials will be made accessible through the Astronomers for Planet Earth (A4E) network. These resources will enable astronomers to use their knowledge and experience as scientists to address climate change in a wide variety of educational contexts.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to: (1) produce a clear mechanism and organizational structure by which members can share and access materials, and significantly increase the number and range of available resources; and (2) communicate with A4E members about what resources members want and have, and work with members to assess ease of access to relevant materials. In support of these goals, the investigators will collect and curate existing resources; perform a materials and needs assessment; test and refine the resource organization; and communicate and distribute materials, inspiring their use. They will publicize the tools and resources through the A4E network, A4E newsletters, and at astronomy meetings around the country. The investigators will encourage student researchers, from a diverse community, training and enabling young students to participate in this important effort.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
