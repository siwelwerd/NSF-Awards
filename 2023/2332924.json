 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a portable technology designed to arrest severe bleeding and provide long-term comprehensive wound care.  In the United States, thirty to forty percent of civilian deaths by trauma are the result of hemorrhage and it is the main cause of death on the battlefield.  Currently, none of the technologies used to address hemorrhage are approved for long-term use.  The proposed technology is designed to seal and heal traumatic wounds without the need for stitches, and may be used to treat gunshot victims and other traumatic wounds at the point of occurrence.  In addition, it may be operated by a non-specialist on the war front or by civilian first responders, and may provide comprehensive long-term wound care. This is particularly important with the rise in gun violence, in pandemic-like situations where emergency rooms are overwhelmed, and in remote regions of the world where access to medical care is limited. In addition, the proposed technology may be used to treat large surface areas encountered in burns or bedsores, and the technology also may be developed to treat wounded animals.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a medical device to treat hemorrhage and promote accelerated healing of traumatic wounds.  The proposed technology uses an airbrush powered by a portable CO2 cylinder to propel a polymer solution in acetone with suspended nano-turmeric, an anti-microbial agent, and an analgesic. The solvent evaporates midair to directly deposit a bioactive and bioresorbable nanocomposite on the wound area to arrest hemorrhage on the spot, provide accelerated wound healing, and long-term wound care.  In addition, the device avoids the potential exposure of first responders to patient blood. The bleed arrest and accelerated wound healing properties of the technology have been evaluated with mouse models.  Further, the solution is exclusively composed of ingredients that are FDA approved for long-term use in humans, which may represent a step forward in comprehensive wound care.  The proposed device may arrest hemorrhage, prevent infection, promote accelerated wound healing, and help save lives globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
