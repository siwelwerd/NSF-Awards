 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many phenomena arising naturally in science, engineering, and mathematics can be described by configurations seeking to minimize some energy. For example, choosing an optimal driving route could involve minimizing the total distance traveled or the total energy consumed by the vehicle. The mathematical study of such questions is known as the Calculus of Variations. Mathematicians seek to improve our big-picture understanding of questions like \"what does the optimal configuration look like?\" or \"if I deviate slightly from the optimal configuration, how much more energy do I use?\" The principal researcher's work is focused on such problems that arise geometrically. For example, just like the optimal driving route might minimize the length between the starting and ending points, a soap film spanning a wire loop can be modeled by saying that it tends to form the configuration that minimizes the surface area among all possible shapes spanning the loop. Closely related ideas include functionals from materials science that model contact between distinct phases of matter. Even though these are natural and well-studied settings, many basic questions about the shape and nature of optimal configurations remain unsolved.  These projects will focus on the notion of \"stability\" which is related to the question of how a configuration compares to nearby-less optimal-configurations, and specifically will study the ramifications of stability for such questions about optimal configurations. One key component of these activities will involve training the next generation of researchers to tackle such problems. This will be accomplished by mentoring and teaching as well as creating publicly accessible educational materials describing cutting edge research topics.\r\n\r\nThis research program will focus on stable minimal hypersurfaces and related problems. Jointly with Chao Li, the principal investigator has recently solved the stable Bernstein problem in four-dimensions: a complete stable minimal hypersurface in four-dimensional Euclidean space is flat. A series of questions will be studied that are connected to stable minimal hypersurfaces as well as related problems such as scalar curvature, with the eventual goal of understanding stable Bernstein problem in higher dimensions. Similar problems will be investigated for related areas such as the Allen-Cahn equation. These projects will also consider the relationship of stability and scalar curvature comparison geometry, as well as investigate weaker forms of stability (finite Morse index) as it relates to the min-max constructions of minimal (and other) surfaces. For example, these projects  will investigate the area-spectrum (p-widths) of other surfaces, following  work with Christos Mantoulidis computing the p-widths of the two-sphere. The PI will continue to mentor graduate students and postdocs, as well as continue to give classes and minicourses related to these areas of research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
