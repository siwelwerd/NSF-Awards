 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural History Collections play an important role in society in fostering education and fascination. They have a specific impact on biological research and applied conservation genomics by providing key genetic information obtained from biological specimens. For example, they can inform how species have changed in a changing world. Further, collections can help identify when and what factors have influenced such changes, Finally, they can provide data to aid in planning how to take action to mitigate future loss of biodiversity. Unfortunately, museum collections are often seen as cabinets of little-used artifacts useful only for school visits. It\u2019s possible that lack of exposure and restricted access to specimens contribute to this negative viewpoint. One place to start changing this perspective is in academic institutions. Therefore, exposing students to positive Natural History Collections experiences by creating exciting research programs, such as combining biological specimens and genomics, is a goal of this project. This research will connect students with collections-, field- and lab-based research in generating data to answer fundamental questions in conservation genomics using the iconic Galapagos Islands as a backdrop. Several species on these islands have experienced dramatic population declines in recent decades, some have gone locally extinct, and the genetic consequences in surviving populations are not understood. Many of these species are endemic to their islands, highlighting the urgency for accurate genetic estimates to inform future conservation planning. For these reasons, the researcher has created GalapaGenomes, a platform to generate specimen-derived genomic data. Crucially, the work will also provide immersive research experiences in the lab, museum, and classrooms for the next generation of scientists belonging to historically underrepresented groups. \r\n \r\nTwo outstanding questions regarding conservation genomics in island species require resolution. First, what are the changes at a genomic scale in natural populations that have suffered declines in the context of well-documented ecological transformation? Second, how might these changes affect the survival of these populations? GalapaGenomes will first immerse students in a newly designed course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE). One goal is to use Natural History Collections to improve the retention of URM students through early research experiences. Second, it will take advantage of the researcher affiliation to the California Academy of Sciences\u2019 unparalleled Galapagos collection (>7,000 specimens) to generate new genomes of three bird species. The genomes will be used to gain insight into conservation genetic measures. Ultimately, this research will diversify and broaden student participation in science and positively impact their interest and incursion into the STEM workforce. This plan will expand the researcher\u2019s existing Galapagos program and strengthen his research and teaching capacity at SFSU, a Primary Undergraduate, Hispanic and Minority Serving Institution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
