The 2023 DRC will be held from June 25-28 at the University of California, Santa Barbara, CA. The DRC offers unique training and networking opportunities particularly to its student and young investigator attendees, helping them advance their careers in materials science, semiconductor technology, and device engineering. The DRC is committed to fostering greater diversity and equity for all attendees and at all levels. By stimulating an open and frank discussion of recent breakthroughs and advances in electronic and photonic devices, the DRC will remove barriers for underrepresented minority groups and support the NSF\u2019s Diversity Mission related to \u201cpreparing a diverse, globally engaged science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce.\u201d \r\n\r\nTechnical Description: The 2023 DRC will feature three plenary talks from world-renowned researchers in electronic-photonic integration, printed and flexible electronics, and quantum transport theory. The conference will include presentations on devices for extreme conditions, 2D devices, spintronic devices, memory devices, RF and terahertz devices, thin-film devices, power devices, and heterogeneous integration. In addition to plenary talks and oral presentations, the 2023 DRC will offer a half-day technical short course in the area of \u201cTwo dimensional materials for the semiconductor industry\u201d taught by prominent experts in the field. The 2023 DRC will also feature a rump session titled \u201cWhat makes a good device paper and how do you measure its impact?\u201d to engage the audience in a vigorous and open discussion on these important topics. To encourage student engagement, the DRC gives awards every year for the Best Student Paper Award and the Best Student Poster Award. The conference program, including the rump session and the short course, will greatly enhance the usefulness of the conference to all attendees. The information will be disseminated through conference proceedings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
