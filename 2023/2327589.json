The conference will feature non-parallel sessions with talks on current research in statistics and probability by distinguished speakers.  There will also be a poster session to give PhD students, postdocs, and junior professors an opportunity to present and receive feedback on their research.  Beyond the educational value from the presentations, the conference should serve to foster collaboration and discussion among the speakers, faculty, and students participating in the event.  Most of the funds from the NSF award will be used to support student participation in the conference, especially travel funds for non-local students.\r\n\r\nPlanned session topics for the conference include: sequential analysis to reinforcement learning; shape constraints and beyond; limit theorems for dependent data; modern data science; nonparametrics and selection biases; and astrostatistics in the 21st century.  For more information or to register to participate, please see the conference web-page: https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/woodroofememorial/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
