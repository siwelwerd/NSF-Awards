 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU Program in Theoretical and Application Driven Mathematics at the Texas A&M University-Commerce recruits twelve undergraduate students per year into an eight-week summer research experience designed to develop a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. Student participants investigate innovative, application-driven research projects in mathematics, working in a collaborative research environment under the supervision of faculty mentors. The program will motivate students to pursue graduate studies in mathematics and will prepare them to be successful future competitors in the job market. It aims to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in the mathematical sciences by enrolling and encouraging participants from underrepresented groups, including minorities, first-generation college students, women, and students from regions with limited resources and opportunities in research.\r\n\r\nThis REU program employs novel concepts and results in both theoretical and applied mathematics to provide research opportunities for students with various backgrounds in mathematics. Some projects use data-driven tasks to model real-life applications. Others employ computer algebra systems to simulate sophisticated mathematical concepts and to illuminate theoretical mathematics results. In addition to ample time spent conducting research and collaborating with faculty mentors, students receive professional development through dedicated sessions involving external visitors from academic institutions and industry, along with internal, round-table discussions on internship and employment opportunities, the peer-review and publication process, collaborative work, and presentation skills training. The program provides students with hands-on experience in mathematical research and the skills needed to thrive in demanding academic and industrial environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
