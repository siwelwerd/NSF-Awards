 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2023 micro-Flow and Interfacial Phenomena (\u00b5FIP) conference will be mainly held at the Norris Center at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, from June 18 to 21, 2023. The conference is one of the premier annual events for researchers in fields related to transport phenomena, providing a platform for researchers to exchange information and identify research needs in this emerging area encompassing many engineering, basic sciences, and bio-medical disciplines. The format of the conference places a special emphasis on formal and informal exchanges between junior researchers (students, postdocs, and junior faculty) and established researchers. \r\n\r\nThe scientific objective of \u00b5FIP is to bring together the phase change and single-phase heat transfer, single- and multi-phase flow, and bio-chemical and bio-medical engineering communities. In addition, a special emphasis lies on energy applications having components exhibiting microchannel flow or microscale surface phenomena, such as found in droplets, thin films, or bubbles. This year\u2019s conference has expanded the range of topics to be more interdisciplinary and relevant to the most pressing challenges, such as climate change and the water-energy nexus. Therefore, the presenters are from a broad variety of disciplines and institutions. One of the most important broader impact objectives is to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in the research communities. For this objective, a student networking event that consists of student presentation session and panel to allow for easy interactions between the youngest generation of researchers (graduate and undergraduate students) will be provided. Additionally graduate students will be selected for an opportunity to deliver keynotes as part of the student keynote award in addition to the traditional format of poster sessions. Similarly, faculty at the assistant and associate level to give keynote presentations will be invited, whereas plenary talks are given by established top experts in the field. Furthermore, the goal of gender parity amongst its committee and all invited speakers will be pursued.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
