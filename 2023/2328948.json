 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract: A multi-qubit system is used in various quantum technologies, including quantum communication, quantum sensing, quantum cryptography, and quantum simulation. Since any quantum system cannot be fully isolated from the environment, open quantum systems are introduced to model the evolution of a quantum system while considering the interactions between the quantum system and the environment. Depending on the strength and the type of this interaction, there are two types of open quantum systems dynamics - Markovian and non-Markovian, where the non-Markovian dynamics are more accurate. In this research, the project team will advance and promote the research on analog quantum simulation of non-Markovian dynamics of multi-qubit systems. In addition, this research will implement an investment and reward feedback loop for inspiring K-12 students and attracting, retaining, and educating undergraduate, female, and underrepresented minority students by exposing them to this quantum-related research. Further, this project broadens and strengthens the current quantum physics curriculum at the undergraduate level by enhancing existing courses and creating new ones.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a quantum system in connection with its surrounding environment is crucial for harnessing the full potential of quantum information processing tasks. However, modeling the non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems faces two grand challenges: (i) current efforts use a modified Markovian master equation to describe the non-Markovian dynamics, which could be inaccurate. (ii) The lack of a systematic method for obtaining approximated positivity-preserving master equations (PPME) limits the capability of current techniques in practice. The research aims to develop analog quantum algorithms to study the non-Markovian dynamics of multi-qubit systems built on the quantum-state-diffusion (QSD) equation approach. Particularly, this research: (i) leverages the QSD approach to obtaining the generalized formalism of the non-Markovian master equation; (ii) optimizes and generates PPME with approximations applied; (iii) develops a systematic method to derive Kraus operators for complicated interactions; (iv) devises a Monte-Carlo-based quantum simulation algorithm initiated from the stochastic quantum trajectories, instead of the density matrix.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (MPS/OMA), Computing and Communications Foundations (CCF) Division, and the Technology Frontiers Program (TIP/TF).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
