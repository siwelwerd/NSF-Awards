 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluid-structure interaction describes the effects of fluid dynamic forces upon flexible structures \u2013 such as wings, bridges, or ship hulls \u2013 and vice versa. Prediction, modeling, and monitoring of fluid-structure interactions are necessary capabilities for avoiding fluid-induced failures in engineered systems critical to transportation and infrastructure. At the same time, targeted structural vibration holds promise as a method of flow-control, with applications that include improved stall resistance of aircraft wings or drag reduction on bluff-bodies such as tractor trailers or large maritime vessels. Current experimental methods do not paint a complete picture of the potential hazards or the realizable benefits of fluid-structure interaction. The principal aim of this research is a deeper and more actionable understanding of the mutual effects of flexible structures and fluids upon one another, and how those effects can be leveraged for improved safety and performance. The research also encourages and thrives upon the collaborative involvement of both graduate and undergraduate research assistants, with pipelines for paid assistantships, class projects, and student outreach initiatives on campus and at a rural high school.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research contributes toward a paradigm shift in the way that experiments in fluid-structure interactions are performed and leveraged for smarter, safer, and more efficient design, modeling, and monitoring. Specifically, the planned approach will (1) produce new workflows for quantifying spatial fluid loads on flexible bodies; (2) deduce previously unrecognized causal links between fluid flow structures and fluid-structure dynamics; (3) quantify the efficacy of structural vibration in controlling turbulent flow separation; (4) generate a large and well-documented experimental database for use by other researchers; and (5) evaluate the use of blended didactic-experiential learning for improving student competency in the topic of fluid-structure interactions. Spatial models of fluid loading will be developed through systematic experimentation on submerged structures, using novel full-field deformation sensing. The study will utilize particle tracking velocimetry of flow over canonical vibrating profiles to assess the effects of structural resonances upon flow separation and reattachment. Open-access educational modules will be developed and piloted in existing undergraduate courses to introduce engineering students to fluid-structure interactions through hands-on experimentation. This work will produce generalizable physical insights that improve the safety and efficiency of aerospace, civil, and maritime systems. Moreover, by making such research more accessible to engineering students, this work facilitates awareness of fluid-structure interactions across engineering disciplines, helping future engineers produce smarter, safer, and more efficient designs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
