 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract: In recent years, quantum mechanics have enabled breakthroughs in computing, communication, and sensing. Gravimeters based on free-fall wave-like cold atoms and matter-wave interferometry demonstrated competitive short-term sensitivity and unprecedented long-term stability. Transportable quantum gravimeters measuring the absolute gravity value or the gravity gradient have recently been used in out-of-laboratory surveys. However, compact and versatile quantum gravimeters with simultaneous sensitivity to the gravity field and its higher-order derivatives have yet to be demonstrated. The third-order derivative of the gravitational potential, the so-called curvature, represents the change rate of the gravity gradient and is sensitive to local mass density changes. Measuring the gravity curvature would open the door for providing horizontal resolutions in mining exploration and detecting near subsurface shallow density structures. In this project, the collaborative team from Rutgers-Newark and UC Berkeley aims to advance state-of-the-art quantum gravimeters with scalable atom-cooling structures and enhanced light-atom interactions. The team aims to not only develop the methods for efficient cooling atoms and manipulating their quantum superposition states but also build a prototype quantum gravimeter that can simultaneously measure gravity and its vertical second and third-order derivatives. In addition, the team implements a plan to broaden participation in quantum information science and engineering with unrepresented students in STEM majors, including developing a certificate program in optics, developing new quantum sensing courses, and building a cold-atom educational kit.\r\n \r\nTechnical Abstract: Nowadays, gravimeters based on atom interferometry are one of the leading quantum sensors transferring from laboratories to the field. The state-of-the-art compact quantum gravimeters can measure the absolute gravity value using a single vertical atom interferometer and the gravity gradient using differential geometry. Due to the complexity of adding extra atom interferometers, compact quantum gravimeters that can measure the third-order gravity derivative have yet to be developed. In this project, the team at Rutgers-Newark and at UC Berkeley aims to develop scalable large-moment-transfer atom interferometry to simultaneously measure absolute gravity and its vertical second and third-order derivatives. Centered around advancing atom interferometry with compact magneto-optical traps (MOTs) and efficient large moment transfer, the team aims to achieve three research goals: (1) Demonstrating three vertically-separated single-beam MOTs in diamond-shaped mirrors; (2) Demonstrating atom interferometers using a single Raman beam to measure gravity at three heights; (3) Improving the sensitivity with large momentum transfer based on spin-depend kicks and adiabatic rapid passage. To expand participation and train students in quantum information science and engineering, the team plans educational activities to inspire students, particularly students from underrepresented groups in STEM, to participate in this project and further expose them to broader quantum sensing and computing topics.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (MPS/OMA), and the Technology Frontiers Program (TIP/TF).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
