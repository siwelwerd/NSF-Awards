 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness and improve research and teaching at the home institution. This award to Albany State University supports faculty and undergraduate research experiences as they seek to improve the decontamination process of Escherichia coli O157:H7, non-typhoidal Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes bacteria to increase the shelf life of different foods by utilizing elevated hydrostatic pressure/high pressure processing (HPP), mild temperature, and natural antimicrobials.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of this project are to: 1) conduct a comprehensive study to compare traditional heat-based pasteurization and HPP decontamination process of Escherichia coli O157:H7, non-typhoidal Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes with mild temperature; 2) evaluate the synergistic effect of natural antimicrobials combined with HPP to inactivate E. coli O157:H7, non-typhoidal Salmonella and L. monocytogenes; and 3) investigate biofilm formation of E. coli O157:H7, non-typhoidal Salmonella and L. monocytogenes over time on stainless steel and plastic surfaces at different pressure stress and temperatures. This project is expected to enhance foodborne pathogen decontamination using the synergistic effect of less than 600mpa pressure combined with other environmental factors such as mild temperatures and antimicrobials that will assure the quality and fitness of food for distribution. These results can also help food industries to validate existing food decontamination processes and improve food cost effectiveness. Additionally, the development of this research focus at Albany State University will strengthen and improve the existing food safety knowledge, practice, and attitudes of undergraduate students, as well as enhance the STEM education learning experience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
