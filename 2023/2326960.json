 "awd_abstract_narration": "This international collaboration between the University of Colorado, the University of Kyoto, and the National Institute of Polar Research in Tokyo, will investigate the sources of atmospheric turbulence in coastal Antarctica. Strong winds forced against terrain produce waves called atmospheric gravity waves, which can grow in amplitude as they propagate to higher altitudes, becoming unstable, breaking, and causing turbulence. Another source of turbulence is shear layers in the atmosphere, where one layer of air slides over another, resulting in Kelvin-Helmholtz Instabilities. Collectively, both play important roles in accurately representing the Antarctic climate in weather prediction models. Collecting new turbulence observations in these remote southern high latitudes will improve wind and temperature forecasts of the Antarctic climate. This project will observe gravity wave and shear-induced turbulence dynamics by deploying custom high-altitude balloon systems in coordination and collaboration with a powerful remote sensing radar and multiple long-duration balloons during an observational field campaign at the Japanese Antarctic Syowa station.\r\n\r\nThis research is motivated by the fact that the sources representing realistic multi-scale gravity wave (GW) drag, and Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) dynamics, along with their contributions to momentum and energy budgets due to turbulent transport/mixing, are largely missing in the current General Circulation Model (GCM) parameterization schemes, resulting in degraded synoptic-scale forecasts at southern high latitudes. This project utilizes high-resolution in-situ turbulence instruments to characterize the large-scale dynamics of 1) orographic GWs produced by katabatic forcing, 2) non-orographic GWs produced by low-pressure synoptic-scale events, and 3) KHI instabilities emerging in a wide range of scales and background environments in the coastal Antarctic region. The project will deploy dozens of low-cost balloon systems equipped with custom in-situ turbulence and radiosonde instruments at the Japanese Syowa station in Eastern Antarctica. Balloon payloads descend slowly from an apogee of 20 km to provide high- resolution, wake-free turbulence observations, with deployment guidance from the PANSY radar at Syowa, in coordination with the LODEWAVE long duration balloon experiment. The combination of in-situ and remote sensing turbulence observations will quantify the structure and dynamics of small-scale turbulent atmospheric processes associated with GWs and KHI, thought to be ubiquitous in polar environments but rarely observed. Momentum fluxes and turbulence dissipation rates measured over a wide range of scales and background environments will provide datasets to validate current GCM parameterizations for atmospheric GW drag and turbulence diffusion coefficients in the lower and middle atmospheres at southern high latitudes, increasing our understanding of these processes and their contribution to Antarctic circulation and climate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
