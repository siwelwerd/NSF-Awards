 "awd_abstract_narration": "All massive galaxies are known to possess super massive black holes (SMBH) in their gravitational centers. When fueled by in-falling gas, these SMBH systems generate huge amounts of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum and, often, powerful radio jets, forming an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The emitted radiation accelerates powerful AGN winds which interact with gas in the host galaxy. This form of interaction, or AGN feedback, is thought to be a crucial phase in the formation and evolution of galaxies.  However, many aspects of the physics of AGN winds remain unanswered. The way to make progress in answering these critical questions is to bring AGN researchers together for an open exchange of ideas.  Therefore, the PIs are holding a dedicated conference, \u201cAGN Winds on the Chesapeake'' at the Tidewater Inn, Easton, MD, 11-16 June 2023.  The PIs will actively encourage and fund the participation of younger researchers, including post-docs and graduate students, with an emphasis on women and under-represented groups. These young scientists will have the chance to present their results on an equal footing with the most senior researchers in the field.\r\n\r\nThe PIs aim to bring together more than 80 experts and young scientists with the goal of imparting state-of-the-field knowledge to the next generation of AGN researchers.  This is of particular importance with the advent of new data from the James Webb Space Telescope, and the imminent launch of a new X-ray observatory, the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission. Beyond these missions, the next great observatories, such as LUVOIR and Lynx, will be launched after 2030. Therefore, it is the younger generation of AGN researchers who will be making new advancements with these platforms.  The proposed conference will be focused on key astrophysical questions around AGN winds. Among these are: the transfer of material and energy between the black hole and host galaxy; the fundamental parameters of the accretion process fueling the black hole; and the role of radio jets in entrained feedback.  The presentations, which will be invaluable for guiding future research, will be disseminated to the greater AGN research community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
