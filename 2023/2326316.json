The NSF-funded ASCENT network has been established to provide high quality, long-term aerosol characterization with high temporal resolution. The workshop will allow researchers to identify studies and utilize the network data to advance process-level understanding of aerosol sources, chemical evolution, and subsequent impacts on human health and climate.\r\n\r\nThe ASCENT workshop will be held at the Georgia Institute of Technology in a hybrid format from Thursday morning, May 25 through Friday afternoon, May 26, 2023. The workshop will be comprised of presentations, facilitated discussions, and breakout sessions. The workshop format is chosen to promote open discussions and informal exchanges that will advance the field and build new collaborations. Workshop participants will come from academia and government laboratories across the U.S. as well as from similar networks operating in European countries. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this workshop include the opening up of new research directions that will have a positive, synergistic effect on the efficiency and research progress in the understanding of aerosol sources, chemical evolution, and subsequent impacts on human health and climate. The workshop will also facilitate collaborations and transfer of knowledge between academia, industry, and government, as well as strengthening connections between various measurement networks within the U.S. and internationally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
