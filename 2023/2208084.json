 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop a novel noninvasive device for detecting and diagnosing gastroesophageal reflux. Reflux occurs when a bolus of gastric contents flows from the stomach into the esophagus. Symptoms of reflux can include chronic cough, choking, difficulty breathing or swallowing, upper airway infections, and chest pain. These symptoms can also be associated with other serious medical conditions. The proposed technology will aid clinicians in quickly being able to assess their patients\u2019 symptoms and determine if reflux is the underlying cause. A noninvasive diagnostic modality for assessing reflux could save the healthcare system $10 billion annually, allow clinicians to provide improved care to their patients, and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of the 80 million Americans who are affected by reflux-related symptoms.\r\n \r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the development of a patented technology which uses pulse-echo ultrasound and proprietary algorithms in a non-conventional way to create an acoustic signature. The acoustic signature can detect and differentiate a bolus in the esophagus. The esophagus distends in response to a bolus of material, eliciting the esophageal layers to change in respect to one another. These changes can be observed with ultrasound sensors placed externally on the skin. This project will develop and validate electronic hardware, software, and custom ultrasonic transducers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
