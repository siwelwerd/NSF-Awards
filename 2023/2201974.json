 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides fund to support participation of US-based mathematical scientists in activities conducted at BIRS. The Banff International Research Station (BIRS) is a research infrastructure dedicated to all aspects of mathematical sciences, including pure and applied math, computer science, statistics, physics, biology, data science and their myriad synergies. Its mission is to facilitate mathematical innovation and discovery at the highest international level through collaborative research and cross-disciplinary synergy. It also plays an important role in talent development, by creating impactful meetings between the future STEM workforce and academic, industrial and government leaders in their fields. Since its inception in 2003, BIRS has expanded into five centers, with primary location in Banff, Alberta. It maintains a presence in four different countries (Canada, Mexico, China and Spain). A cherished meeting place for scientists, educators and scholars, BIRS's intense and immersive programs have acquired global distinction as incubators of transformative ideas and breakthroughs at the frontiers of research. Its unique environment promotes creativity, innovation and exchange of knowledge. BIRS programming reaches far beyond the traditional model of workshops and conferences; it builds bridges between academia, industry and government, with lasting impact on the scientific landscape. Best practices in equity, diversity and inclusion, facilitation of training and mentorship are incorporated in every aspect of BIRS operations, from proposal selection to program delivery, ensuring a balanced representation of groups, expertise and career stages in each cohort.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRS's post-COVID planning involves programming expansion and development in a number of new directions. Transition to the hybrid format has resulted in global access to all BIRS programs. The new \"BIRS Now!'' has generated a nimble way to create high impact collision venues on topics that demand rapid response from research. Such topics include climate change, clean energy, infectious disease modelling, vaccine distribution and fairness, national quantum strategy, responsible development of artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, blockchain and others. The regularly offered \"Career and Innovation Hub\" introduces students and early career researchers to emerging career opportunities in science and technology sectors. Annual summer schools, some in partnership with other institutes, train undergraduate and graduate students in emerging areas following recent breakthroughs that have potential for future growth. Programs like \"Focused Research Groups\", \"Research in Teams\" and \"Group follow-ons\"  provide opportunities of distraction-free research to small teams of collaborators, sometimes for projects started at other BIRS events. In 2022-2027, at least 3943 US scientists are expected to visit BIRS. This award, which has been deemed worthy of support through peer-reviewed evaluation using NSF's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria, will be used exclusively for supporting participation of US-based mathematicians at BIRS activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
