 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description: Quantum information science and engineering (QISE) is an active area of research and development with significant potential to push the fundamental performance limits for computation, networking, and sensing. This project aims to establish integrated QISE research and education activities at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) in close collaboration with Clemson University and the University of Rochester. The research activities are aimed at facilitating the discovery of new materials and functionalities for quantum computing and networking applications by establishing a quantum transduction testbed. The educational components are focused on establishing an undergraduate program in QISE with strong hands-on components to train a highly diverse and proficient workforce. The collaborative nature of the project combined with the core research facilities it enables not only brings WSSU faculty and students to the forefront of QISE research but helps train generations of diverse QISE workforce in the Carolinas. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description: The realization of quantum processor networks is crucial for the advancement of scalable quantum technologies. Using current technology to achieve high-efficiency quantum transduction (QTR) with minimal noise remains a formidable challenge. In collaboration with experts in quantum research at Clemson University and the University of Rochester, a team at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) aims to address the existing QTR bottlenecks by developing a versatile testbed for high-throughput testing of hybrid quantum materials and device configurations for high-performance QTR applications. The Winston-Salem Hybrid Quantum Laboratory (WHQL) is established as the core facility to house the testbed. This effort positions WSSU at the forefront of quantum technology research, enabling rapid exploration and discovery of multifunctional materials and devices for efficient, low-noise QTR via electro-optical or electro-optomechanical microwave-photon coupling mechanisms. WHQL not only enhances WSSU\u2019s research capabilities but plays a crucial role in creating a sustainable pipeline of a diverse workforce to support our nation\u2019s growing Quantum information science and engineering (QISE) research and development activities. This effort is expected to serve as a model for integrated QISE research and education activities to be utilized by historically black colleges and universities across our nation with no or nascent QISE program.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (MPS/OMA), and the Technology Frontiers Program (TIP/TF).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
