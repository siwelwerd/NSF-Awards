 "awd_abstract_narration": "Francisco Javier Mercado is awarded a Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and education at Pomona College. Francisco plans to utilize a state-of-the-art, galaxy formation simulation of a large portion of the Universe to develop a better understanding of the internal structure of low mass (faint) galaxies. His work will provide important predictions that can then be tested by observations of real galaxies with telescopes like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Mercado will also work with faculty and students at Pomona College to establish a bilingual (English and Spanish) planetarium series in service of nearby communities of color.\r\n\r\nMercado will utilize FIREbox, a novel large-volume cosmological simulation to investigate the morphologies, structure, and scaling relations of a statistically significant sample of simulated low-mass galaxies (including ultra-faint dwarf galaxies). The large and diverse sample of simulated galaxies in FIREbox will allow Mercado to make predictions for future observations as a function of galactic environment. Additionally, Francisco will work to establish a sustainable planetarium series in English and Spanish. The goal of this program is twofold: (1) to help Pomona College students gain experience in presenting complex astronomical phenomena in a way that is digestible for general audiences of diverse backgrounds and (2) to increase the participation of the general public (specifically communities of color in the surrounding areas) in conversations regarding current developments in the field of astronomy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
