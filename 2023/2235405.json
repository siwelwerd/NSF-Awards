 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to develop sustainable, robust AI methods to overcome obstacles to digital communication and information access faced by Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) individuals, empowering them personally and professionally. Users of American Sign Language (ASL), which has no standard written form, lack parity with hearing users in the digital arena. The proposed tools for privacy protection for ASL video communication and video search-by-example for access to multimedia digital resources build on prior NSF-funded AI research on linguistically-informed computer-based analysis and recognition of ASL from videos.\r\nPROBLEM #1. ASL signers cannot communicate anonymously about sensitive topics through videos in their native language; this is perceived by the Deaf community to be a serious problem.\r\nPROBLEM #2. There is no good way to look up a sign in a dictionary. Many ASL dictionaries enable sign look-up based on English translations, but what if the user does not understand the sign, or does not know its English translation?  Others allow for search based on properties of ASL signs (e.g., handshape, location, movement type), but this is cumbersome, and a user must often look through hundreds of pictures of signs to find a target sign (if it is present at all in that dictionary).\r\n\r\nThe tools to be developed will enable signers to anonymize ASL videos while preserving essential linguistic information conveyed by hands, arms, facial expressions, and head movements; and enable searching for a sign based on ASL input from a webcam or a video clip.\r\n\r\nParticipants include DHH individuals, Deaf-owned companies, and members of other underrepresented minorities. The products will serve the >500,000 US signers and could be extended to other sign languages. The proposed application development brings together state-of-the-art research on: (1) video anonymization (using an asymmetric encoder-decoder structured image generator to generate high-resolution target frames driven by the original signing from the low-resolution source frames for anonymization, based on optical flow and confidence maps); (2) computer-based sign recognition from video (bidirectional skeleton-based isolated sign recognition using Graph Convolution Networks); and (3) HCI, including DHH user studies to assess desiderata for user interfaces for the proposed applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
