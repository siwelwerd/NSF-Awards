 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cold atoms are the workhorses of precision measurements. They provide universal standards for time and frequency, and stable platforms for tests of fundamental physics such as the equivalence principle between gravitational and inertial mass. Despite the transformative potential for mobile devices based on cold atoms to revolutionize timing, or navigation without Global Positioning System (GPS), cold-atom clocks and interferometers have largely remained laboratory-scale devices. The limited use of cold-atom systems outside of laboratory environments is due to the size and complexity of most cold-atom instruments, as well as their sensitivity to physical conditions that are not being directly measured, such as ambient temperature variation, stray electromagnetic fields, and subtle deformation of the components. The aim of this project is to overcome implementation challenges with cold-atom sensors and demonstrate compact and mobile atomic clocks and accelerometers that maintain state-of-the-art performance in the field, outside of laboratory conditions.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop two cold-atom quantum sensing platforms that share a common technology base and have complementary functionalities. A transportable cold-rubidium atom interferometer will provide differential acceleration measurements, and a portable cesium optical lattice clock will support timing in remote locations. These devices will be useful for applications in navigation, fundamental physics studies, and spatially resolved measurements of gravitational fields. To miniaturize and ruggedize these cold-atoms systems, the project will develop and integrate a set of photonic chip-scale hardware and algorithms, comprising a \u201cquantum sensor toolkit\u201d, that include lasers and optics, optimized quantum algorithms for sensor fusion and calibration, and optimal leveraging of entanglement. These approaches will broaden the utility of cold-atom sensors in real-world scenarios and enable scientific investigations outside of the lab, for example, gravity surveys on challenging terrains and precision measurements at the poles or in space.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
