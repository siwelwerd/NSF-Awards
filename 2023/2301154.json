 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Kansas region is facing a serious advanced manufacturing labor shortage that inhibits industry growth and economic development in low-income rural communities. This project from Northwest Kansas Technical College will establish an academic pathway with built-in micro-credentials that are aligned with the needs of industry to increase awareness of the industry to secondary students and potentially expedite employment in these high-demand fields. Over the 3-year project, 83 students from 5 regional secondary schools will be recruited to complete 3 courses in advanced manufacturing technology. The project will bring advanced manufacturing technology and equipment into the classrooms of the secondary schools for hands-on components of the courses. Educators at the secondary schools will receive professional development training on the equipment and technology in order to better serve students taking the courses and increase adaptation of the technology into other related courses and projects. Career opportunities in advanced manufacturing will be presented to students through regional industry partners that visit the secondary schools. Because the project will be focusing on reaching regional secondary students, there is a large focus to increase the diversity of students that complete the project, and continue their education with the goal of employment in a STEM field. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the project is to increase the number of students entering the STEM workforce in the region with relevant classwork and industry experience. 83 students are expected to enroll over the 3 years of the project and 9 faculty members will be trained with a mixture of in-person, hands-on professional development and hybrid coursework. Students will take 3 courses that will introduce them to additive and subtractive manufacturing technology and processes, as well as the design principles used in both processes. Students will complete a capstone project to demonstrate skills learned and they will present their project to industry partners for review and feedback. College faculty members will work closely with members of the industry advisory committee to develop and integrate up-to-date industry-relevant material for students and proper professional development for faculty members. Advisory board members will send representatives to the secondary schools periodically throughout the timeline of the project to lead marketing efforts of the project and increase awareness of the industry. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
