 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of technology to address hearing loss and exploring follow-on applications of the technology. This project aims to improve outcomes and safety of Cochlear Implant surgery and help relieve the burden and costs (estimated $981B) of hearing loss to patients globally. In the US alone, lost productivity due to hearing loss costs up to $194B annually. There is also a large personal cost as people with hearing loss reported higher cases of loneliness, depression, and isolation. This technology will provide real-time feedback to surgeons to refine their surgical technique, as well as provide an unprecedented clinical dataset to surgeons and care providers to guide post-op care. Together, these will allow patients who undergo Cochlear Implant surgery to improve preservation of their residual hearing and reduce the risk of poor surgical outcomes. By addressing barriers to adoption, this technology can re-connect more people with the hearing world.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a sensor technology and intraoperative guidance system to improve hearing outcomes after Cochlear Implant surgery. Hearing loss is a leading cause of disability worldwide, responsible for an estimated $981B in global costs. This project aims to develop and deploy Micro Electro-Mechanical System sensors integrated with Cochlear Implants to quantitatively monitor the electrode position and forces in real-time in order to augment the surgeon\u2019s tactile feedback. The sensor technology coupled with a Machine Learning guidance system will allow technique refinement within and across patients. Cochlear Implant surgery will yield more consistent hearing outcomes, including residual hearing preservation. Moreover, the data generated by this sensor system will enable new intra- and post-operative protocols as the medical community better understands the pitfalls during implantation. Improved surgical outcomes and rehabilitation plans enabled by this approach will facilitate broader regulatory approval for expanded eligibility and boost patient adoption. This technology will expand the market for Cochlear Implants, can improve hearing and quality of life by helping reduce isolation, depression, and loneliness associated with hearing loss.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
