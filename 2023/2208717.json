 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a nanotechnology-based coating to combat the rise in Healthcare Acquired Infections (HAIs). HAIs spread in hospitals through healthcare workers\u2019 hands and exposed surfaces. The coating technology developed through this project will disinfect surfaces contaminated with viruses and bacteria.  The antimicrobial coating provides protection on these surfaces between cleanings. In the United States, 1 in 25 patients get a preventable HAI from hospital visits. HAIs cost hospitals an estimated $40 billion annually to treat. Commercialization of this technology will lead to fewer preventable illnesses and deaths, while decreasing the financial burden on the healthcare system for each HAI case. Other markets that will benefit from this work include businesses impacted by norovirus (stomach flu) such as cruise ships, restaurants, schools, nursing homes, chip manufacturing facilities, and food processing plants. \r\n\r\nThis project develops a novel, nanoparticle-enabled coating to combat the rise in HAIs. A novel nanoparticle with a high output of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and potent antimicrobial behavior has been developed. Because the antimicrobial mechanism is a secondary surface reaction, the technology can effectively deactivate viruses and bacteria without being consumed. Phase I demonstrations were achieved using bench top batches of nanoparticles. Phase II research and development creates a manufacturing process appropriate for the synthesis of the novel nanoparticles, creating a shelf stable formulated product, while ensuring the advances in nanoparticle production and formulation do not degrade the nanoparticle's antimicrobial efficacy. The synthesis allows for a decrease in the nanoparticle cost at scale.  Shelf stability of the formulated product is important to the overall logistics and supply chain of the product. Improvements to both the scaled synthesis and formulation chemistry will be evaluated for impacts to the disinfection efficacy of the final product.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
