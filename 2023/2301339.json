The conference is part of an annual series that brings together internationally known researchers, industrial mathematicians and computer scientists, as well as post-docs, graduate students, and undergraduate students, to discuss the latest advances in combinatorics, graph theory and computer science.\r\n\r\nThe 2023 edition of the conference features four plenary speakers, Dr. Tomas Kaiser (University of West Bohemia), Dr. Luke Postle (University of Waterloo), Dr. Jinyoung Park (Stanford University), and Dr. Yufei Zhao (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), who are leading researchers in combinatorics, graph theory and theoretical computer sciences. There will also be 40 to 60 contributed talks. The conference website is (https://www.mtsu.edu/cumberland2023).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
