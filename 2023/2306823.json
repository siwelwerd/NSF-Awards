 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will support research at the intersection of structural mechanics and network theory. Switching structures -- systems made of bars connected via pin-joints, where some of the bars can be dynamically switched ON and OFF -- will be introduced to engineer load-bearing structural systems that emulate the complex behavior of switching networks, where edges connecting the nodes evolve, adapt, switch, and blink. Switching networks are known to exhibit exotic dynamics; for example, at select switching frequencies, networks switching between unstable states can gain stability. This rich dynamic repertoire opens interesting opportunities in structural engineering. For example, can one create structural systems that, due to the presence of switching elements, can recover stability as they are about to collapse? Can one leverage the time-varying properties of switching structures for vibration attenuation? The answer to these questions requires the development of new fundamental knowledge about switching structures. The research will develop new knowledge by blending the disciplines of structural mechanics and network theory, and by identifying common modeling tools between them. In turn, this knowledge will allow to assess the potential applicability of switching structures in structural engineering and beyond. Just as structural mechanics can be transformed by network-theoretic advancements, network theory could immensely benefit from the creation of mechanical systems that can be used to validate network-theoretic conjectures. The educational activities are also at the intersection of networks and structures and leverage the contrasting identities of the institutions involved (public and private, suburban and urban, yet merely 50 miles away from each other) to help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and contribute to the formation of forward-thinking, interdisciplinary engineers. \r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this project is to establish a network-theoretic framework to study switching structures. Such an objective will be achieved by formulating a mathematical backdrop of switching structures, which recognizes some of the attributes that make them unique among other network systems. This mathematical backdrop, together with finite-element simulations, will be used to chart the stability of switching structures, and their response to static loads. These theoretical endeavors will allow to unveil the origin of islands of stable behavior at intermediate time scales that have been recently observed in switching networks, but whose physical underpinnings are not yet fully understood, Finally, this project will provide significant steps towards exploring the feasibility of switching structures, by realizing tabletop-scale prototypes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
