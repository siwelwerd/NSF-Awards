 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Symposium on Industrial Ecology for Young Professionals (SIEYP VIII), organized by the International Society for Industrial Ecology Student Chapter Board (ISIE\u2010SCB), focuses on translating industrial ecology (IE) research into tangible outcomes through policy development or implementation. The main goal of this symposium is to provide an opportunity for young professionals who perform research in IE to enhance their skills to identify and develop ways to translate environmental engineering and sustainability research concepts into actionable items, visit industrial areas proximate to the conference location in Leiden, the Netherlands that have implemented innovative IE concepts, discuss their novel research ideas and experiences, and receive constructive feedback. The Symposium will be held during early July 2023. \r\n\r\nThe symposium will build participants' fundamental skills that will assist in research and grant writing, oral presentation, developing effective research products, and increasing the impact of their research. The symposium will also provide students and young researchers with the skills to connect their research interests to policy relevant questions. Moreover, it is expected that this symposium will facilitate initiation of long\u2010lasting international relationships and collaboration among young professionals. These interactions provide opportunity for joint projects that may result in benefits to USA science and society at large. The symposium will have immediate benefits for participating U.S. researchers, and compounding benefits for domestic and international environmental sustainability efforts that stem from idea sharing and joint projects over time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The main goals of the event were to: (1) Understand the role that industrial ecology professionals have in society and ways in which this position can be leveraged, e.g., by disseminating research to a wider audience; (2) Build skills to communicate research outcomes to a wider audience in ways that spark interest; and (3) Learn how to disseminate research in ways that can impact society (e.g., through policy briefs and popular press releases).</p>\n<p>The number of participants in the 8th SIEYP totalled 160 people. This number is almost a 100% increase compared to the previous in-person event (the 6th SIEYP in Beijing, China) with 83 participants.&nbsp; Among the participants, 48 received a scholarship, including 29 American citizens or residents who received a scholarship funded by this NSF grant and 19 other participants who received external scholarships. By attending both SIEYP VIII and ISIE 2023 conference, they also examined their ideas with experts in the field of industrial ecology, as well as established relationships with international peers and professionals for collaborations in their future research.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The main outcome of the conference was in providing opportunities for professional development among the NSF-supported US-based attendees. After the event, a survey was sent out to the participants to understand the event&rsquo;s impact. Among 38 answers, the majority indicated high satisfaction with how the event was organized and managed (excellent 61%, good 37%, adequate 3%). The main benefits of attending the SIEYP, as seen by the participants, were networking with other students (92%), getting inspired (66%), engaging in conversations about industrial ecology (55%), understanding their role as industrial ecologists (39%), learning about a broader impact of industrial ecology (37%) and sharing their research (32%). Among all the survey answers, 22 were from people who received a scholarship to attend the event.

After the student community was able to meet in person at the SIEYP, we received double the number of applicants (ten) for this year&rsquo;s SCB election.
