The conference includes a session designed to address diversity and inclusion in the scientific workplace. The GRS is a dedicated avenue for doctoral and post-doctoral researchers to present and discuss their work and establish collaborative relationships with their peers. Mentors and trainee moderators will facilitate active participation in scientific discussion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
