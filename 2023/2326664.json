 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The proposed technology is based on using 3D printing design technology to generate oral therapy devices that are custom fit to the individual patient. Currently, traditional fabrication methods for oral appliance therapy to treat OSA are costly, and the average wait time is 3 weeks. This can lead to patient non-compliance and/or delays in treatment of OSA. The goal is to create a device that is more comfortable, effective, and non-invasive and provides additional treatment options for patients with OSA.  The proposed generated devices may then be worn by patients to treat OSA through nightly wear, which may reduce the societal impacts of sleep apnea and healthcare costs.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of point-of-care manufacturing of devices to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  The proposed technology is based on advancements in additive technology to allow low-cost, custom fabrication of digitally designed oral appliances.  Oral appliance (OA) therapy uses a device to protrude the jaw in a more anterior position during sleep to treat obstructive sleep apnea.  It may be used as an alternative to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy or as a combination therapy. Oral appliance therapy has been shown to have higher compliance rates than continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).  Point-of-care manufacturing eliminates the need for expensive manufacturing equipment or individually hand-made OA that increase treatment costs and prevent access to care for patients.  In addition, the patient wait time for point-of-care manufactured devices may be reduced from weeks to hours.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
