 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rock deformation laboratory at Rice University studies the physical processes that control faulting and earthquake hazards. The lab, which is headed by an early career PI, uses high pressure and temperature experiments to measure the mechanical and physical properties of rocks from areas prone to earthquakes. This proposal will support the creation of a laboratory technician position that will enhance research, education, and training opportunities in the Rice rock deformation laboratory. The technician will increase the group's capacity to host visitors from other universities and to support undergraduate research projects.\r\n\r\nThe rock deformation laboratory hosts two triaxial deformation apparatus to study the rheology and deformation processes of rocks. Recent and ongoing research is focused on the physical properties of rocks from subduction zone settings and the role of rock rheology in controlling the speed and mode of fault slip. Recent growth in technical capabilities, number of students, and community service requires additional technical support to maintain and grow the size and scope of the Rice research program. The new research technician will (1) assist undergraduates and visiting scientists who are conducting experiments, (2) educate students on equipment design, use, and maintenance, (3) maintain a physically safe laboratory including maintaining equipment and developing and documenting protocols, (4) oversee data storage and management, (5) assist with education and outreach activities, and (6) participate in the design and scope of our research program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
