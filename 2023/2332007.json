 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides support for US scientists to attend the Conference on Molecular-Level Understanding of Atmospheric Aerosols to be held in Corsica, France, on April 1-5, 2024. The objective of the conference is to provide molecular level perspectives on aerosol properties that are critical to the impact of aerosols on air quality, climate, and environmental as well as human health.\r\n\r\nChallenges currently exist in understanding the formation of aerosol particles from gaseous precursors and the initial growth of these particles, the internal structure of aerosols, aerosol phase behavior, heterogeneous and multiphase (photo)chemistry, gas-surface interactions, the ability of aerosols to initiate ice and cloud nucleation, the evolution of aerosol optical properties, and the role of bioaerosols in the atmosphere. The conference will take place over five days and include oral and poster sessions spanning the topics listed above.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the support for the conference will go toward travel support for student, postdoctoral, and early career professionals to help promote their careers. The meeting agenda, presentation titles, and abstracts will be archived on the meeting website, open and available to all. Summaries of the discussions will also be archived on the website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
