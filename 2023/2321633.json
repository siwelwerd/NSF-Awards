 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diversity in the STEM workforce remains a challenge as evidenced by the historical underrepresentation of low-income, racial, ethnic, gender representation, and first-generation individuals in STEM education programs and in STEM careers such at data science and artificial intelligence (AI). The ExLENT-AI Externship project will provide experiential learning opportunities to people from historically underserved and underrepresented groups in the emerging technology fields of data science and AI to broaden access for diverse individuals to learn about and potentially work in careers in these areas. North Carolina State University will partner with Delta Air Lines, Lexmark, Charity Navigator, Randstad, and other industry organizations to collaborate on the design and implementation of the 40-week externship program. The externship is a combination of live, weekly workshop sessions and real-world, industry mentoring, job shadowing, and working on authentic tasks with partners. The objectives of ExLENT-AI are to: 1) leverage evidence-based best practices in experiential learning to attract diverse learners to emerging technology careers; 2) recruit individuals with from historically underserved and underrepresented groups to participate in the ExLENT-AI evidence-based externship program; 3) strengthen partnerships with appropriate stakeholders to develop an integrated, collaborative network to best support participants; 4) establish a community of learners for the cohorts through mentorship and other community-building activities; 5) prepare participants to gain relevant artificial intelligence competencies, knowledge, and skills; and 6) support participants through the job search process and placement into their new careers in artificial intelligence. \r\n\r\nThe ExLENT-AI Externship project will leverage the use of ten evidence-based best-practices found to be effective in delivery of experiential learning and attracting/retaining participants from historically underserved and underrepresented backgrounds. These ten key practices include: 1) establishment of a STEM ecosystem, 2) use of the Collective Impact Model; 3) coursework that has structured curricular activities; 4) inverted classroom models for coursework delivery; 5) teamwork and group/cohort engagement in discourse and application of knowledge; 6) sustained involvement in externships where individuals are engaged in authentic tasks with real-world industry context; 7) engagement of mentors; 8) clear articulation and assessment of learning objectives; 9) use of incentives and rewards (e.g., stipends and certificates); and 10) guidance through career coaching and job search support. This project will contribute broadly to the achievement of societally relevant outcomes including the development of a diverse, globally competitive emerging technology workforce in artificial intelligence. This program model will be fully developed and will prepare 33 new individuals historically underserved and underrepresented in emerging technology careers, including women, first-generation college students, veterans, persons with disabilities, and racial/ethnic minorities. Additionally, through strong partnerships with industry, the project team will have a mechanism to continue to provide access, opportunity, and empowerment to diverse groups to continue a sustained talent pipeline and direct connections to careers. This project fits well within the NSF ExLENT program, supported by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, as it seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals from diverse professional and educational backgrounds to increase their interest in, and their access to, career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
