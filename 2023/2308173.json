 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to address fundamental issues in cosmology, specifically the discrepancies in our understanding of the expansion rate of the universe and the clustering of matter. These inconsistencies, known as the 'Hubble tension' and the \u2019sigma-8' tension, challenge the current standard cosmological model. Scientists at Swarthmore College will conduct new theoretical work to provide insights into the nature of these tensions and offer new theoretical explanations. As part of this project, the PI will train undergraduate students in effective science communication and involve them in research activities. This effort will leverage existing training programs and develop a science communication curriculum, fostering a culture of research and spreading knowledge of the scientific process. This approach not only enhances education but also promotes diversity and inclusivity in the scientific community. Overall, this project has the potential to advance our understanding of cosmology, address fundamental tensions in the standard model, and contribute to the training of future scientists while promoting effective science communication.\r\n\r\nThe PI will address tensions in the current standard cosmological model, known as LCDM, by investigating extensions and alternative models. The tensions arise from inconsistencies between predictions made by LCDM and measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the clustering of matter. The project will determine the theory space available to models addressing these tensions, characterize their specific signatures on the CMB and large-scale structure, and further explore the non-linear dynamics of cosmological scalar field models. The project's intellectual merit lies in its contribution to the cosmological research community's readiness for upcoming observations. It will develop a robust method to determine the properties of models that successfully address the tensions, provide new insights into constraints using current and future cosmological data, and explore the effects of cosmological scalar fields on various phenomena.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
