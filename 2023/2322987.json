 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will partially cover travel expenses of graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, junior faculty members, and invited speakers from institutions in the United States to participate in the conference entitled, \"97th American Chemical Society Colloid & Surface Science Symposium,\u201d which will be held in Raleigh, NC, June 4-7, 2023. This is the largest annual meeting of the Colloids community with 500 anticipated attendees. The intellectual merit of this symposium lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of cutting-edge research, and exposure to a richly diverse array of topics in many areas relevant to the CBET community including technical sessions on Active Matter, Colloids for Energy and Sustainability, Self- and Directed Assembly, Wetting and Adhesion, and Machine Learning and AI for Colloids. The conference will be attended by both prominent and young scientists who will be discussing present and future directions of research and research challenges. The conference will foster cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers in cutting-edge areas of colloids, soft- and active matter, self- and directed assembly, and relevant emergent areas and will address challenges involved in advancing the field.\r\n\r\nThe American Chemical Society Colloid and Surface Science Symposium is a long standing and most recognized in the areas of colloid and interfacial sciences. The meeting at North Carolina State University will be organized into 13 sessions and a poster session that covers many research areas and includes topics that are of special relevance to industry. Special consideration is given to young leaders in the field and underrepresented minority researchers to present their research and/or serve as session chairs. The diversity of the speakers and organizers helps maintain a high degree of creativity and innovation alongside well-established work in the field. The organization of the symposium involves a wide circle of faculty from regional universities as well as representatives from non-educational institutions and companies in the area. An industry-led session is organized where representatives from several chemical and pharmaceutical companies are invited to speak on a variety of topics such as translation of basic science to industry, differences between academic and industry R&D, and career tracks in different business sectors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The RTP area is home to several major academic institutions: North Carolina State University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Duke University. The area is a large and rapidly growing nexus of high technology research in microelectronics, biotechnology, nanotechnology and biomedical engineering. This symposium was held in the McKimmon Center at NCSU and was deemed a success, with 383 attendees, 325 oral, and 60 poster presentations. The Symposium included 14 sessions highlighted by invited oral presentations with a diverse group of early career and energetic researchers, and areas that tie in strongly with the RTP, including additive manufacturing and colloidal metamaterials, biomaterials and pharmaceuticals, and colloids for energy and sustainability. A special session named \"Connecting the Dots\" which invited speakers from a range of industries to share their professional development journey, was also very well attended. Attendees enjoyed a dinner reception at the NC Museum of Art, which featured drinks and food served near a variety of beautiful art pieces. Plenary lectures were presented by Lisa Biswal from Rice University and Joelle Frechette from the University of California-Berkeley. Xiao Su from the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign received the Unilever award and Haichao Wu from Harvard received the Victor K. LaMer award. Additional highlights included a special session of the Langmuir Graduate Student Oral Presentation Awards with 8 outstanding finalists.
