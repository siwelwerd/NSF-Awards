 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the twelfth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Radiation and Climate, to be held at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, 23-28 July 2023. Additional support is provided for the sixth Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), convened just prior to the GRC. The GRS is a pre-conference meeting targeted specifically at students and early-career scientists, intended to provide an environment in which participants with comparable levels of experience and education can come together to discuss their current research and build networks for long-term collaboration. The theme of the GRC and GRS is \"Theoretical and Observational Constraints on Climate System Behavior\", including constraints derived from conservation principles and power law relationships.  Topics include constraints on precipitation from energy balance, emerging observational techniques, and constraints on climate system behavior due to radiative transfer in the water vapor continuum.\r\n\r\nThe GRC and GRS have scientific broader impacts by serving as a venue for the exchange of results and ideas among researchers attempting to understand the radiative processes that govern weather and climate. The meeting is expected to be particularly advantageous for early-career scientists, as it is formulated to promote in-depth interactions among junior and senior scientists over the course of a week, in a conducive setting of manageable size with few distractions. The topics to be addressed are of societal interest given the key role of radiative effects in controlling and regulating climate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
