This travel grant assists students from the U.S. universities to attend MobiHoc, build and strengthen their ties to the community, and share scientific information through participation in the keynote presentations and technical sessions.  Priority will be given to students from under-represented groups (including women, minorities, and those with disabilities), authors lacking other funding, and first-time attendees.\r\n\r\nThe ACM MobiHoc is a premier symposium with a highly selective single-track technical program dedicated to addressing the challenges emerging from networked systems that must operate in the face of dynamics ranging from changing user demands to connectivity and resource availability. Examples of such dynamic networks include wired/wireless communications, data centers, sensors, energy, social, and transportation networks. This award will help increase the representation and participation of U.S. based students at the conference by providing travel grants limited to a maximum of $1,200 each. By attending the event, the students will be exposed to the state-of-the-art advancements in the field and will have the opportunity to engage with peers from institutions around the world, connect with prominent researchers, and take part in conversations that are likely to influence their future and the direction of the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
