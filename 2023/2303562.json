 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports Future Earth to provide capacity building and engagement activities for US scientists working in global change research. Future Earth harnesses the insights and capacity of the global scientific community to address global problems and ensures that the results of this work extend beyond academic communities and impact broader decision processes. Future Earth efforts are based on the recognition that modern sustainability challenges require coordinated research efforts bringing together the world's best researchers in the natural, social, behavioral, and engineering sciences, and connecting these researchers with the needs and capacities embedded within a wide range of stakeholder institutions and communities. Future Earth\u2019s global initiatives, include a flagship capacity building program (Earth Leadership Program), far reaching communications products (Anthropocene Magazine), and strong collaborative data-platforms.\r\n\r\nBy elevating the spread and impact of scientific results and connecting these results with constituencies in business, government, and civil society, Future Earth\u2019s work supports better decision making around the world. This work also connects US researchers with a vast and rapidly growing network of leading international scholars in global change research and provides direct access to new knowledge and initiatives. Much of this work is supported through strategic communications that extends the reach of sustainability science published around the world, and delivers the very best global science in the right format, and at the correct time, to shape global outcomes. This project will include the publication of the award-winning Anthropocene Magazine which consistently brings the very best sustainability science to the broadest possible audience around the world, and the establishment of the Sustainability Research and Innovation Congress - the first global convening supporting global connections between sustainability science and innovation communities around the world on an annual basis. Finally, Future Earth will continue leading the Earth Leadership Program, which builds on the 20 years of success of the Leopold Leadership Program, and focuses on training diverse cohorts of high-impact mid-career scientists to reach beyond their disciplinary expertise to become sustainability science leaders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Major activities in this grant focused on informed public communications and engagement with a growing sustainability science community. Various products included the science-informed futures anthology The Climate Parables, a web archive and event platform for the Global Indigenous Youth Summit on Climate Change, annual reports covering each of the Sustainability Research and Innovation Congresses and the full programming of Future Earth Global, and an interactive community gateway. This gateway, the Future Earth Member Portal, has multilingual support and enhanced user features to support the Future Earth community and beyond with networking options, event management, and collaboration tools. The second Global Indigenous Youth Summit on Climate Change was developed and hosted on the portal in collaboration with Indigenous Youth Leads and the Science Diplomacy Center. Partners are now connecting with the portal to enable joint proposal development and science coordination, especially in geographically distributed and multilingual groups. The team analyzes all of these communications and engagement products to ensure that the format and content is being consumed by a diverse and growing audience and the platforms that are being used to distribute information are widely accessible.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/22/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: EricaLKey\n"
