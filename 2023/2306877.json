 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. Texas Southern University seeks to implement a project-based learning model in the Chemistry II laboratory course to provide Freshmen students classroom-based research experiences, as well as provide support students in a mentored summer research program.  As a result of their participation, it is anticipated that students would acquire 21st century competencies needed for careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe project at Texas Southern University seeks to positively impact student attitudes towards STEM education and increase student persistence in STEM disciplines. The objectives are to 1) to reform the General Chemistry laboratory course using project-based learning methods for first year undergraduate students; and 2) to immerse undergraduate students from underrepresented groups annually in an intensive 6-week summer enhanced learning and research program. Students will be directed through the analytical process by using the scaffold methodology, in which they formulate a question, consider sampling, prepare samples for analysis, analyze the sample, report data, evaluate results, draw conclusions, and determine the needs for future research. The project outcomes, guided by an external evaluation, are expected to contribute to understanding not only the success of the program, but add to the knowledge base of the preparation of underrepresented groups using project-based learning methods, retention of students in STEM disciplines, and student pursuit of advanced degrees and careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
