This will be an in-person meeting with approximately 150 participants including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and senior researchers from colleges, universities, and laboratories around the world. The workshop will facilitate the exchange of ideas between junior and senior researchers in electronic structure theory and serve as an opportunity for creating new collaborations. The workshop will focus on the latest developments in electronic structure theory and computational materials science. The simulation techniques covered by the workshop are used across a variety of fields including physics, chemistry, and materials science, both in academia and in industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
