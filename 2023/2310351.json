 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a FASEB Meeting on the structure, function, and relationship to disease of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), to be held June 11-15, 2023 at the Crowne Plaza Melbourne-Oceanfront Hotel in Melbourne, FL.  \r\n\r\nMeeting attendees will include graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, as well as senior researchers, that will gather to discuss our understanding of all aspects of the biology and function of the ER, the complex structure that surrounds the cell nucleus and which regulates the formation and destruction of proteins and fats in cells.  Talks will be presented on topics such as how proteins are formed and modified to function within and outside of cells, how fat levels are regulated in the cell, and how the ER senses and responds to stress to maintain its essential functions.  In addition to formal talks, engagement will be facilitated by two extended poster sessions to stimulate interactions between researchers.  NSF support will be used to defray travel and registration costs, to provide childcare support for children of attendees, and to allow attendance of participants during early stages of their careers, especially members of groups underrepresented in this field.\r\n\r\nThe endoplasmic reticulum is an essential, and arguably the most complex, organelle present within all eukaryotic cells.  ER function is central to the synthesis and turnover of both proteins and lipids, and the ER contains robust stress response pathways that serve to augment ER function in response to potentially toxic conditions or developmental cues.  The meeting will bring together seasoned investigators with students and early-career scientists in both formal talks and discussion sessions to encourage informal discussion and the sharing of the latest research results on the synthesis, folding, and turnover of proteins, lipid dynamics and storage, ER structural remodeling and ER-organellar communication, and the unfolded protein response. Recent advances in the field, including new technological capabilities, will be highlighted.\r\n \r\nThis award is funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This successful conference brought together an international group of 105 scientists to discuss the latest research on the functions of the ER. Over half of the registered participants (57/105) were first-time attendees at a FASEB meeting. Junior researchers were well represented: 37 of the attendees were trainees (graduate student or postdoctoral fellows) and 30 were early career faculty (&lt;10 years as faculty). Fourteen trainees studying in the United States received travel awards ($500/person) funded by the NSF grant. In addition, the NSF grant covered 50% of the registration costs ($500/graduate student award; $575/postdoctoral award) for 14 early career scientists training in laboratories in the Unites States. These NSF funds helped to enable the participation of junior scientists that might otherwise have not been able to attend due to financial constraints. All recipients of NSF funds actively engaged in the meeting and presented their research during poster sessions, poster flash-talks, and/or platform short talks.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual merit:</strong> An important objective of the Conference was to bring together a diverse complement of junior and senior scientists studying the ER to present and exchange knowledge surrounding the latest research in the field, and to outline and establish scientific connections that will enable future research progress. The meeting ran over the course of 5 days, with morning and evening sessions. Meeting presentations covered the breadth of research within the ER field. The EMBO Keynote lecture was given by Dr. Jodi Nunnari of Altos Labs, emeritus professor at UC Davis, who described her lab's work on the mitochondria and its role in the exchange of proteins and lipids with the ER. Eight scientific sessions followed over the rest of the week, covering broad aspects of ER biology, including: early events in protein biogenesis, organellar-contact and communication with the ER, ER protein misfolding and turnover, lipid dynamics and storage, ER dynamics, ER remodeling and turnover, the response to ER stress, and the role of the ER in aging and disease. The Conference exposed participants to a broad range of experimental systems and approaches. There were 30 invited oral presentations (20 min. in length) and 12 short-talks selected from submitted abstracts (10-12 min. each). Ample time was provided for questions (10 min. or 3-5 min. for invited or short talks, respectively), allowing for scientific dialog. Two afternoon poster sessions allowed for the broad dissemination of new findings by 60 presenters.

One-third of invited talks went to early career faculty (9/30; assistant professors or equivalent). In addition, all selected short talks (12/12) went to junior researchers (graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, or assistant professors). All attendees were encouraged to present posters.
