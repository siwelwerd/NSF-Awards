 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program is to assist universities and colleges in diversifying the nation's science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by increasing the number of STEM baccalaureate and graduate degrees awarded to persons from LSAMP populations. LSAMP populations are defined as persons from groups underrepresented in the STEM enterprise: Blacks and African-Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders.\r\n\r\nThe Alabama Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ALSAMP) consists of nine diverse institutions, including doctoral granting institutions and five Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).  The institutions are: The University of Alabama (Lead Institution); University of Alabama at Birmingham; University of Alabama at Huntsville; University of South Alabama; Oakwood University (HBCU); Miles College (HBCU); Talladega College (HBCU); Stillman College (HBCU); and Alabama A&M University (HBCU). The overarching goal of the 2023-2028 ALSAMP program is to continuously improve strategies to institutionalize and sustain evidence-based recruitment and retention practices for student success in completing undergraduate and graduate degrees in STEM disciplines, particularly scientific and technical areas of national priority. Specifically, in support of developing a well-prepared 21st century workforce to meet the challenge of the NSF Big Idea, \"Harnessing the Data Revolution\", the Alabama LSAMP incorporates a required suite of hybrid computational programming for all students.  Evidence-based practices to be implemented include: performance-based stipend support, first-year bridge programs, spring research conference, summer research experiences, community college/transfer bridge, and international research opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe research study investigates factors affecting the participation of LSAMP populations in extra- and co-curricular career development (ECCD) activities.  With little research on this topic for this population of STEM students, the study contributes to research on STEM programming for underrepresented groups, as well as psychological research on motivation in educational settings. In project year 5, a broadening participation research conference is proposed that will involve participation from the STEM Pathways Research Alliances within the LSAMP community for broad dissemination of the community's STEM educational research activities. Dissemination of external evaluation and the research study will also occur through the alliance websites, conference participation and publication in STEM and professional association journals. ALSAMP activities have the potential to promote widespread and sustained transformation of undergraduate STEM education. The new computational component will broaden the skillset of STEM majors to address the growing needs of computation as a transdisciplinary skill.  Research experiences, both domestic and abroad, contribute to the development of a globally competitive workforce. Findings from the research study and evaluation have the potential to improve LSAMP and other programs that target students from underrepresented groups, contributing to the larger goal of increasing the number of degrees earned in STEM programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
