 "awd_abstract_narration": "The instrument that will be funded provides a fast, easy way to analyze the chemical composition of most solids. It does not destroy or affect the sample, and can analyze spots as small as one micron (50 times smaller than the width of human hair). Sample preparation is simple, and does not involve toxic chemicals, and an analysis takes between 2 and 6 minutes. In addition to its ability to analyze chemical composition, the instrument can also image the sample at the micron-scale. These qualities make it incredibly useful to a wide range of scientists, from geology and planetary science, to engineering, chemistry and biology, to archaeology and even art history and preservation. Because it does not involve using hazardous chemicals or complex, multi-step sample preparation, it is also a great tool for teaching and for summer research projects, including programs aimed at increasing diversity in the field.\r\n\r\nThe funds will be used to purchase a state-of-the-art, 5-spectrometer electron microprobe with EDS and CL detectors. This will replace the existing (now failing) microprobe that has been highly productive, and highly used, over its 20+ year history, serving researchers in a wide range of fields. The microprobe has been an integral part of both graduate and undergraduate education. The goal is to continue and expand this success, maintaining an open and high-quality microprobe facility.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
