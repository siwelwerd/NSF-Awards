 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need for enrolling academically accomplished STEM students in teacher education programs to help reduce STEM teaching shortages, especially in rural areas. This aim will be met by providing scholarships to train students majoring in Biology, Chemistry, Earth & Space Science, Mathematics, and Physics to teach in high-need secondary schools. Teacher training will include skills on how to teach many different types of students in both rural and urban schools. The project will also support and mentor new practicing STEM teachers. The teachers produced by the project will provide K-12 students with strong STEM foundations and increased science understanding. Through this approach the project offers the promise of laying a foundation for better job opportunities and economic growth in rural communities. \r\n\r\nThis project at Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) includes partnerships with 12 Local Education Agencies (LEAs): (Altoona Area School District, Armstrong School District, Leechburg Area School District, Penns Manor Area School District, Punxsutawney Area School District, Apollo-Ridge School District, Northern Cambria School District, Greater Johnstown School District, Homer-Center School District, United School District, Indiana School District, and Pittsburgh Public Schools) and two community colleges (Penn Highlands Community College and Butler County Community College). Project goals include: (1) recruiting 20 undergraduate STEM majors who pursue secondary teaching certification in biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, or earth & space science; (2) retaining 90% and graduating 100% of retained scholars; and (3) supporting 20 new, in-service teachers by providing both STEM teacher and IUP faculty mentorship and ongoing professional development. Project impact will be assessed through an independent formative and summative evaluation. Findings will inform how scholar participation in a particular activity increases motivation to teach in a high-need LEA and contributes to a student\u2019s growing knowledge and skill base related to teaching in a high-need LEA. The project will also generate new insights into effective new teacher induction programs in both urban and rural school districts. This model will be broadly disseminated to other public teacher education colleges seeking to develop and expand STEM teacher preparation programs. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
