 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the area of honey adulteration detection. Honey adulteration which is the process of deliberately adding adulterants such as corn, cane, beet, and rice syrups in honey can have significant economic and organoleptic consequences. The proposed technology will allow honey importers, packers, and retailers, as well as food authentication agencies to quickly track the authenticity of their honey products at each step of the supply chain by quantifying the abovementioned adulterant syrups in a facile and convenient manner. This will significantly improve the product\u2019s authenticity and traceability. Further, in situ testing for the presence of honey adulterants as well as floral and geographic fingerprinting will allow various honey market segments to demand the appropriate price for their pure honey products in the global market. With food fraud continuing to escalate globally, the food authenticity market is expected to grow to $8.3 billion (USD) by 2023. Adulterated honey constitutes 7% of food fraud cases, amounting to $581 million (USD) by 2023 in total market size disruption.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a portable mid-infrared spectrometric device and a smartphone application system that can simultaneously quantify the presence of various syrups (i.e., corn, cane, beet, and rice) as well as sugar content (i.e., glucose, fructose, and sucrose) in honey in less than 2 minutes. Current methods for detecting these adulterants in honey are considered expensive, time consuming, archaic, and cumbersome. Most of these tests are being conducted via third-party laboratories using expensive and complex analytical equipment. The smartphone application system will contain the research group\u2019s proprietary developed multivariate calibration system that can simultaneously quantify the presence of the aforementioned adulterants in honey in a facile, convenient, and affordable manner using the mid-infrared spectrometric device. Further, the multivariate calibration algorithmic system will also feature aspects related to determining the floral and geographical origin of honey.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The key findings from this project are as follows:</p>\n<p>Goal 1: By the conclusion of the seven-week national I-Corps program, the team had interviewed 108 individuals to assess the commercial viability of the proposed honey authentication technology. Following the program, one European company specializing in organic honey production and the largest honeycomb producer in Europe was also interviewed. Additionally, Dr. Gerard Dumancas (technical lead) and Dr. Riddhiman Medhi (entrepreneurial lead) attended the Hive Life Conference in Sevierville, TN, from January 4-6, 2024, where they interviewed 21 potential customers, mainly local beekeepers and small honey companies. They also participated in the American Beekeeping Conference in New Orleans, LA, from January 9-12, 2024, interviewing 28 attendees from academia, industry, and non-profit organizations. On September 7, 2024, Dr. Medhi attended the Philadelphia Honey Festival, where he interviewed 10 individuals, including members of the Philadelphia Beekeepers Guild and owners of small honey businesses.</p>\n<p>Goal 2: The team engaged with various customer segments, including large honey packers and suppliers, honey exporters, government/private authentication agencies, and beekeepers of all sizes. Contacts were gathered through honey organizations, online directories, referrals, and conference attendance.</p>\n<p>Goal 3: A budget revision request for a miniaturized spectrophotometric device was submitted and approved by the NSF Program Officer. Once the device arrives, the team plans to develop a multivariate calibration model to assess honey authenticity. Currently, a graduate student is being trained to use the device for research on honey authenticity.</p>\n<p>From the interviews, honey packers emerged as a key potential customer segment, as they conduct more testing than other groups. It was noted that different countries have varying requirements for honey and adulteration testing; for example, Canada and European nations place greater emphasis on these tests compared to the US. Adulteration testing is often performed by third-party labs in Germany or Texas and is seen as costly and cumbersome. Consequently, small beekeepers are generally deterred from testing due to expenses but may be interested in testing for nutritional information. Partnerships with honey councils or organizations were identified as potential avenues to introduce the technology. Beekeepers value product purity, with small producers focusing on moisture and color testing but typically avoiding adulteration tests due to high costs. Conversely, larger producers conduct adulteration tests but find the current processes cumbersome. Honey packers, who source from various suppliers, prioritize testing, though costs can be prohibitive for those not testing or burdensome for those who are. The price for adulteration testing typically ranges from $200 to $500 per sample, with some packers spending between $25,000 and $500,000 annually. Portable honey authentication devices are of particular interest to large producers and packers, as they promise significant cost and time savings.</p>\n<p>The primary customer archetype for our proposed honey adulteration testing device is large honey producer-packers. These customers need regular testing to verify the authenticity of their products, which they sell to major supermarkets and grocery chains. They also source honey from local beekeepers and import it from countries like Brazil and Canada. Typically, they operate their own packing facilities with around 5-20 employees.</p>\n<p>Inspired by this project, Dr. Dumancas developed a course titled 'Chemistry Entrepreneurship' at the University of Scranton in Fall 2023. The course, which included seven students, focused on experiential learning related to customer discovery and product-market fit for various chemistry innovations. Students engaged directly with stakeholders, including potential customers, partners, and experts. Over the 15-week course, teams were given a selection of chemistry innovations and technologies, covering areas such as novel water pollution analysis methods, simple food adulteration detection techniques, the use of mobile applications and modern communication technologies to address poverty and enhance education, artificial intelligence applications for sustainability challenges, modern chemistry techniques for detecting Lyme disease and diabetes, and sniffing technologies for improved explosive trace detection. Additionally, a patent is currently under review for a system to analyze honey (United States Patent and Trademark Office, Application No. 63/596,466, Attorney Dockey No. 187398-3018, Nov. 6, 2023).</p>\n<p>The next steps involve creating a multivariate calibration model to assess honey authenticity with the miniaturized spectrophotometric device. The team is also considering the possibility of launching a fundable company, but additional work is necessary before making that decision. Ongoing customer discovery and further technical research will help develop a well-researched, commercially viable business model canvas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified:
