 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical description: The in-person conference, and an online working group, will explore the question of reproducibility in condensed matter physics experiments. Condensed matter physics is a branch of physics that studies phenomena in collective behavior of atoms and other particles, for example in solids. This area is of recognized fundamental scientific and broad importance, that furthers the understanding of new states of matter, precipitates the discovery of new materials, invention of electronic devices and sensors. The program is composed of a diverse set of speakers, with focus on inclusion and equity. A particular emphasis is made on reaching out to potential participants from historically black colleges and universities, as well as minority serving institutions.  Societies of Physics Students are engaged in recruitment for the workshop, and research groups are encouraged to send undergraduate, graduate students and postdocs to the conference.\r\n\r\nTechnical description: The condensed matter physics community does not currently follow established protocols for verifying the reproducibility of published work. The conference offers this highly productive and impactful community an opportunity to discuss how reproducibility can be defined, standardized, carried out, assessed, and promoted. The focus is on studying the examples of reproduction attempts, on how to identify irreproducible research, how to promote and support reproduction efforts, where to publish such works and how to give credit to researchers that carry them out. The effort has an international reach reflecting the collaborative nature of many of the efforts in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
