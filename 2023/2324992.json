 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of catalytic materials that will enable the more efficient and green production of high value materials including pharmaceuticals and dyes.  These proposed catalysts may be recycled or used for extended periods and are easily separated from the final products, which simplifies the manufacturing of these materials. In addition, the proposed materials materials have an advantage by making use of porous organic polymers that may provide solution-like reactivities as well as the advantages of a supported surface immobilized catalyst.  The recyclable and ease of separation combine to create systems that may be used in conventional or emerging production methods and lower production costs. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of new concepts in catalysis enabled by new generations of polymers with high degrees of internal free volume.  These proposed polymers have high degrees of porosity and are created by molecular level designs that fuse non-compliant 3D monomers directly into the polymer backbone.  The polymer structures are modular and can include structures capable of reactions that are promoted by light that oxidize of reduce compounds (photoredox reactivity), as well as thermochemical metal catalyzed reactions.  Catalytic polymers can be bound to magnetic inorganic magnetic particles, glass sidewalls of reactors, on stirring turbines, or on the surfaces of tubing.  The polymer structures and pockets around the catalytic sites can produce selectivity and high numbers of turnovers.  In the case of photoredox catalytic materials, the polymers display much higher rates than molecular catalysts dissolved in solution, as a result of their excitonic and charge transporting abilities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Under prior NSF funding Swager and coworkers developed methods wherein plastics with intrinsic porosity defined at a molecular level, could be used to create novel catalysts that provide economic advantages and can reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing. These catalytic porous organic polymers (Cat-POPs) create new supported (heterogenous) catalysts that are in the form of particles or functional surfaces that are easily dispensed and separated for recycling. Under NSF I-Corps funding we conducted detailed customer discovery and conducted  125 interviews of scientists from both academics and industry that have insights on pharmaceutical and fine chemical production. The findings revealed that there is a need to reduce catalyst consumption and Cat-POPs can expect adoption if no metal is leached from the particles/coatings during the reactions and they give reproducible performance. Interviews revealed major interest in lowering the amount of metal used in the drug production, which is afforded by the high catalytic turn-over numbers afforded by Cat-POPs.

Through-out this process we were assisted by an industrial mentor, Dr. Laurence Hancock, the CEO of Akita Innovations. Swager, Hancock, and MIT colleague Buchwald founded ArO-X LLC to commercialize Cat-POPs. We have also identified additional applications of these materials as high-capacity absorbents that can also catalytically decompose toxic chemicals. In collaboration with Akita Innovations we are seeking SBIR funding to produce materials for these latter applications.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/03/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: TimothyMSwager\n"
