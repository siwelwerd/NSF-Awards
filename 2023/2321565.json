 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project expands advanced computing capacity at North Carolina State University (NC State). The resources enable larger models, faster simulations, larger datasets for more accurate Artificial Intelligence models, and faster processing of genome assemblies. The resource is deployed into a supportive environment - the High Performance Computing (HPC) facility - which provides outreach, training, documentation, tutorials, support, and tools for access, visualization, job execution, and an onboarding process for beginning users.\r\n\r\nThe project installs six Lenovo SR670 nodes with the latest NVIDA Hopper architecture (with 12x H100 and 12x L40 NVIDIA GPUs) so that teaching, classroom use, and research (including research from the science drivers) can expand, relieving the compute congestion on the current GPU cards. More than twelve science applications will be supported on the system. Applications include ab-initio methods such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, neural network training, cryo-EM, genome assembly, and fluid simulation. More than 200 projects are supported by the HPC facility. Access to this system will be provided for all students, including undergraduates. Educational impacts include access to the system for teaching, classroom use, and research capability for HPC users. A significant portion of the resource will be made available to Open Science Grid, providing increased computing capacity for scientific users nationwide.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
