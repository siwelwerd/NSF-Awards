Cluster 2023 involves participants (researchers, developers, and users) from academia, industry, laboratories, and commerce, coming together to discuss recent advances and trends in cluster computing. The project provides support for students at U.S. institutions to participate in IEEE Cluster 2023, which will be held from October 31 to November 3, 2023 in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. The Student Program at IEEE Cluster provides a comprehensive means for students to improve their overall research skills and planning, beyond presenting posters and papers. The project promotes the progress of science by supporting diversity, education and training of the next generation of scholars.\r\n\r\nStudents supported by this project will participate in the regular conferences activities, and a student program comprised of special sessions that target research presentation training, research experience and career guidance, and industry interaction as well as a session with authors of best paper and best poster candidates. Particular effort will be made to solicit applications from students from under-represented communities. The supported students will gain unique experiences and interactions with academic and industry researchers in the cluster computing community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
