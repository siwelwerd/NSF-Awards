 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Training Group in Logic and Its Applications will integrate a cohort of undergraduate students, graduate students, a postdoctoral fellow, and faculty through a series of yearly thematic problems. These are topic areas where meaningful versions of problems exist at the undergraduate, graduate, and research level. Each level of the group addresses their research problems, supported by the other levels of the group. The aim is to make undergraduate and graduate students part of a culture of research in mathematics and to provide support and mentorship at many levels. The broader goals include strengthening research in algebraic logic in the U.S. and providing a pipeline to move students at a majority minority R2 HSI into research-level mathematics. It is hoped that this can be a model for other institutions\r\n\r\nTraditional educational models have not provided an effective means of creating a pipeline of highly-qualified STEM personnel from mathematics departments at MSIs. The Department of Mathematical Sciences at New Mexico State University proposes a novel approach to this problem. The Research Training Group in Logic and Its Applications will integrate a cohort of undergraduate students, graduate students, a postdoctoral fellow, and faculty through a series of yearly thematic problems. These are topic areas where meaningful versions of problems exist at the undergraduate, graduate, and research level. Each level of the group addresses their research problems, supported by the other levels of the group. The aim is to make undergraduate and graduate students part of a culture of research in mathematics and to provide support and mentorship at many levels.\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the DMS Workforce program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and the Foundations program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
