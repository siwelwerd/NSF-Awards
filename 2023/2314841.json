 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NBER Summer Institute is an important  environment for developing new ideas and forging collaborative work relationships. Summer Institute brings together economists and scholars in other fields from universities, government, and international organizations for a few days or a few weeks of seminars, workshops, conferences, and cooperative research. The NBER Summer Institutes generate timely and influential research on important economic policy questions related to such topics as international financial stability, economic productivity and technology, environmental regulations, social security policy, and educational policies. The workshops are an invaluable part of the research infrastructure in economics and assist the research of many economists.\r\n\r\nThe Summer Institute is four weeks long and includes at least 50 sessions organized and co-organized by over 100 individuals. There are more than 2,800 attendees each summer from over 425 universities and non-academic institutions. Sessions are also available as livestreams. About two-thirds of all attendees are not NBER affiliates. While there are many presentations of work nearing completion, emphasis is placed on the workshop aspects of the program where new ideas are raised, preliminary research ideas are developed, and plans for joint or coordinated research efforts are established. Efforts are made to include a wide variety of new participants, and to reach out to women and minorities. Calls for papers are circulated widely and are available on the NBER website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
