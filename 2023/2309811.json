 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Number Theory and Combinatorics in Duluth Conference will be held at the University of Minnesota, Duluth, from July 31 to August 4, 2023. The goal of this conference is to bring together people of all career stages, from students to internationally recognized experts, who are studying topics in combinatorics and number theory from various overlapping perspectives. This conference will feature invited talks by researchers working at the forefront of their fields as well as contributed talks and 5-minute lightning talk sessions, which will enable every participant to speak. Mathematicians from underrepresented demographics, early career researchers, and researchers from non-R1 institutions are especially encouraged to attend to ensure a broad exchange of knowledge and perspectives.\r\n\r\nCombinatorics and number theory have been historically interconnected in a variety of ways and have been central in both answering many classical questions and leading to new research directions. Examples include the Gauss circle problem, generating functions, representations of integers as sums of squares and Jacobi's formulas, the partition function, and the work of Ramanujan. These connections have been especially prominent in recent years, particularly due to the extensive use of tools from one area to the benefit of the other. This conference will bring together a wide variety of researchers, and the format of the conference has been designed to give all participants the opportunity to speak to facilitate the exchange of ideas and to encourage collaboration. The conference website can be found at https://sites.google.com/d.umn.edu/gallianfest/home.\r\n\r\nThis conference is supported by the Algebra and Number Theory and Combinatorics programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
