 "awd_abstract_narration": "Promoting workplace inclusion and attaining employee well-being are important for business organizations. Workplace ostracism occurs when an organizational member is excluded or ignored by other people at work. Almost 70% of American employees have experienced workplace ostracism. The situation is worse among employees with a racial minority background, posing a tremendous challenge for organizational leaders who strive to promote an inclusive workplace in an increasingly diverse environment. This project investigates how employees respond emotionally and physiologically to workplace ostracism and the extent to which their racial background and cognitive attribution affect this process. Furthermore, the researchers determine the beneficial effects of relationship crafting, a proactive social behavior that helps ostracized employees to regain social connections, recover wellbeing, and restore performance. Findings of this project have important implications for policy and practice to improve diversity and inclusion in the workplace.\r\n\r\nUsing a multi-method approach, this project conducts three studies. First, using a vignette-based experimental study, the investigators examine the main and interaction effects of workplace ostracism and cognitive attributions on the victims\u2019 emotional strains. Second, employing a battery of laboratory tasks (Cyberball Game, Gift Card Task, and Trier Social Stress Test) and physiological measures (skin conductance level and heart rate variability), the investigators examine the distinct activities of sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system and the function of relationship crafting among ostracized individuals. Third, using the experience sampling method to collect multi-source data in a 10-week period, the investigators examine the fluctuations of workplace ostracism and employee responses that are otherwise missed by a between-subject design. Data is analyzed using multilevel modeling, Monte Carlo based confidence intervals, and multiple-group path analysis. Using a full-cycle design, the investigators ascertain the internal and external validities of the studies and develop a robust theory on workplace ostracism.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
