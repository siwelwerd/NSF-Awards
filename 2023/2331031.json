 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and early-career investigators to attend the 2023 Epigenetics Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) and Gordon Research Conference (GRC) in Holderness, New Hampshire. These conferences will be focused on understanding how non-genetic information is inherited and influences phenotype across a wide range of organisms, including plants, animals, and fungi, and across multiple scales, from single-molecules to the phenomenological. The GRS provides an opportunity for students and postdoctoral researchers to share unpublished, cutting-edge research among peers, develop networks, and benefit from career mentoring. Discussion topics include epigenetic reprogramming during development, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, and the evolution of chromatin.\r\n\r\nThe GRC will advance cross-disciplinary knowledge sharing through a scientific program that includes both leaders and newcomers to the field from across the world. The open exchange of ideas will promote the careers of early investigators and maintain the vibrancy and innovation of the epigenetics field. Discussion topics include heterochromatin, chromatin structure, RNA-directed processes, epigenome maintenance, transposable elements, and epigenetics and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe award is funded by the Genetic Mechanisms program (Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences) and the Developmental Systems program (Division of Integrative Organismal Systems) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
