 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a new type of melt-processable pellet made utilizing phycocolloids derived from different seaweed materials. Today, the commercial plastic packaging industry is reliant on the polymerization of petroleum derivatives, which are then compounded or melt-processed before being converted into finished goods. Mounting consumer backlash against plastic waste, domestic and international regulations, and an increased focus on curtailing dependence on petroleum are driving the demand for compostable packaging solutions that can service the biodegradable packaging market which is set to grow to $812 billion by 2030. By using seaweed as an alternative feedstock, the team's goal is to eliminate the need for more environmentally intensive inputs including petroleum as well as other terrestrial crops. Furthermore, this material technology is being designed for compatibility with existing plastic manufacturing infrastructure \u2013 thereby streamlining a path to scale and cost competitiveness. The anticipated outcome of this project is the development of the first commercially viable polymeric material predominantly derived from seaweed, that is melt-processed and compostable. This breakthrough will unlock a renewable plastic replacement that meets essential requirements for cost, scalability, and environmental impact. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project focuses on the development of a viable pathway for creating melt-processable pellets from seaweed. The goal is to enable the conversion of these pellets using conventional machinery to produce flexible film packaging. The main technical challenge to overcome in achieving successful commercialization is that seaweed materials do not melt at suitable processing temperatures, as do traditional polymers. Consequently, the resulting material does not possess the necessary mechanical properties required for flexible packaging. To address this challenge, the team will explore the tempering of seaweed chemistry and associated materials with selected commercial compostable polymers. This approach aims to achieve comparable strain at break, tensile strength, and stiffness to conventional thin film packaging while ensuring home compostability.  While previous research and applications have explored the use of seaweed for less economically viable film technologies, the unique contribution of this effort lies in combining varying seaweed chemistries and implementing them as a melt-processable seaweed material.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
