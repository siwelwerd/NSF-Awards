 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project advances precision manufacturing. The on-machine metrology system will have a transformative effect on highly efficient and precise optical manufacturing, additive manufacturing, and precision machining. These industries currently face a shared technical challenge: the lack of real-time quality control during fabrication.  The on-machine metrology tool's real-time quality control capabilities will not only drive efficiency in high-precision manufacturing but also contribute to reduced manufacturing costs and enhanced product quality. Overall, the project's anticipated outcomes include an efficient high throughput manufacturing process with on-machine metrology, the development of a compact, snapshot, multi-wavelength on-machine metrology system, and the establishment of a next-generation innovation and entrepreneurship training program. \r\n\r\nThis STTR project seeks to develop a compact, snapshot, dual-mode, multi-wavelength interferometric system for in situ metrology in high precision manufacturing. The lack of real-time quality control during fabrication is a critical hurdle, leading to delays and manufacturing errors. This system integrates unique techniques to overcome this challenge and enhance throughput and accuracy. The technology utilizes a polarization-based, multi-wavelength, snapshot technique providing real-time measurements of machined surfaces with minimal environmental impacts. By offering instant feedback on surface quality, reducing iterations for diamond tool centering, and improving throughput and accuracy, the system becomes the smallest interferometric system suitable for integration into existing equipment for in situ metrology. The project's goal is to develop a market-ready, on-machine metrology system through prototyping, software development, and performance validation. This real-time, in-situ metrology process is estimated to achieve efficiency improvements of 30% or more in diamond-tool alignment and 50% or more in surface metrology. Successful development and commercialization of this system will hold significant intellectual merit, overcoming a critical hurdle in high-precision manufacturing and enabling real-time quality control.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
