 "awd_abstract_narration": "As society increasingly relies on the Internet as critical infrastructure, there are numerous opportunities for policymakers to ensure safe, reliable, and equitable access to this resource. However, policymakers today generally lack the required information needed to make good policy decisions---often due to an absence of policy-relevant Internet measurements. There is an urgent need for investment in the study and deployment of measurements for telecommunications and Internet policy that bridge the gap between the various stakeholders, e.g., lawmakers, regulators, operators, and Internet measurement communities.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTo make further progress toward closing the gap between Internet measurements and policy, there is a need to focus on building an interdisciplinary community that incorporates myriad stakeholders in each domain, instead of one-off and unilateral efforts by each domain. This workshop continues the effort of trying to build this community to address this gap. It will bring together and engage the policy, industry and research community to brainstorm and discuss how these communities can work together to address the Internet data needs of current policies and to work together toward co-design of future evidence-based policies. A summary of lessons learned after the event will be published.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
