 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) has named Dr. Asegun Henry as the 2023 recipient of its Alan T. Waterman Award. This award is NSF's highest honor that annually recognizes an outstanding researcher age 40 years or younger and funds his or her research in any field of science or engineering. This year's awardee will receive a $1 million grant over a five-year period for further advanced study in his field.\r\n\r\nDr. Asegun Henry is the Robert N. Noyce Career Development Associate Professor and Director of the Atomistic Simulation & Energy (ASE) Research Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Dr. Henry is also the founder and CEO of the Thermal Battery Corporation. Prior to joining the faculty at MIT, Dr. Henry was an Assistant Professor at Georgia Tech.\r\n\r\nDr. Henry's research activities span a broad spectrum from studying phonon transport (heat transport) at the atomistic scale to addressing renewable energy storage and energy conversion systems at high temperatures.  At the fundamental level, Professor Henry has made significant advances and contributions to phonon transport in disordered materials, and phonon transport at interfaces using advanced computational approaches. In the area of energy storage he has developed concepts of converting excess renewable electricity into thermal energy stored in molten silicon, that can then be later converted on demand to electricity using photovoltaics. He has developed the highest temperature pump on record, which uses an all-ceramic mechanical pump, to pump liquid metal above 1400\u00b0C (in the Guinness Book of World Records).\r\n\r\nProfessor Henry has been the recipient of a number of awards including: the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the Lockheed Inspirational Young Faculty Award, the Georgia Power Professor of Excellence Award, the ASME Bergles-Rohsenow Young Investigator Award in Heat Transfer. He was also the winner of the 2018 World Technology Award for Energy. He has been awarded a number of fellowships including an MIT Lemelson Presidential Fellowship, a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship, a UNCF-Merck Postdoctoral Fellowship and a Ford Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
