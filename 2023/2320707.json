 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2023 Gordon Research Conference and Seminar in Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (GRC- CCUS) will provide a platform to discuss transformative scientific advances for the new emerging carbon economy. The conference will provide an integrated and inclusive platform where early career researchers, established scientists and engineers, and academics come together to discuss natural and engineered carbon management solutions that will deliver meaningful societal and ecological impacts. The conference is designed to help educate the pipeline of emerging talent on carbon management solutions. In this context, the associated Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will provide a forum for mentoring and training the next generation workforce to advance sustainability solutions to capture, convert, store, and remove CO2 emissions from flue gas emissions, air, and ocean. The conference compelling program includes speakers and discussion leaders from diverse backgrounds with expertise ranging from fundamental chemical interactions to policy. \r\n\r\nThe 2023 GRC-CCUS and GRS will serve as forums to discuss transformative scientific and technologies advances for scalable realization of carbon management solutions. These events will address opportunities and challenges at the forefront of advancing natural and engineered carbon management solutions while considering the emergence of low cost, renewable energy resources, and the need to address environmental justice considerations. The conference and seminar will provide insights into approaches to unlock value in negative emissions technologies, deliver additionally co-benefits, and ensure permanence in storage, all while learning from technologies that are being deployed. The conference and seminar will foster international collaborations to train the next generation of researchers on advancing transformative carbon management solutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
