 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2023, Broadening Participation of Groups Underrepresented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Forests cover nearly a third of all land on Earth, represent the most fundamental and widespread components of living systems, and are experiencing irreversible transformations. Long-term changes in temperatures have induced massive tree die-offs and have limited the potential for recruitment. Nonetheless, surprisingly little is known about the genetic mechanisms that underlie long-term reproductive patterns in forest systems. This study explores the reproductive phenomenon known as masting which involves sudden spikes in reproductive output among trees over time. The study aims to use genetic material obtained from two masting pi\u00f1on pine species to test predictions about how genetic mechanisms underlying this reproductive strategy relate to warming trends. The findings will produce a forecasting methodology to predict long-term resilience of forest systems to temperature change. The project will also proactively recruit students from groups underrepresented in forestry disciplines and immerse them in activities that build on students\u2019 real-life experiences to create meaningful field-based research experiences. Integrating a youth-centered perspective into the research project will encourage students to understand themselves as both practitioners of science and as members of the scientific community.\r\n\r\nThe study compares the pi\u00f1on pine (Pinus edulis) and the single-leaf pi\u00f1on pine (Pinus monophylla) species that reside in differing geographic regions to understand the respective adaptations of these species to environmental gradients associated with temperature. This goal will be accomplished through three objectives that include (1) identifying gene variants (alleles) associated with reproductive traits (e.g., seed size), (2) examining how these variants change over time and terrain (in association with temperature gradients), and (3) determining if the same genetic loci (where alleles associated with masting occur) impact reproductive traits in both species; this last objective will determine how warm-tolerant populations of the respective species have evolved in response to higher temperature regimes. The Fellow will benefit from training to create and analyze functional genomic data sets, establishing collaborative networks related to forest resilience, and strengthening mentorship and teaching skills. This includes a multi-level, near-peer research immersion experience that integrates Indigenous knowledge with management skills; Broadening Participation will include high school and undergraduate students as well as a summit to elevate these goals across multiple groups of stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
