 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a new generation of smart machines used in the measurement of parts and assemblies. The team has demonstrated that this technology can convert existing coordinate measuring machines to self-driving autonomous machines. The ability to automatically measure parts is an important feedback link in the process chain that will enable fully automated manufacturing of the future. Specifically, this automation will reduce the specialized skill required to use a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM). The innovation will enable workers to operate a CMM and get a precise part measurement. This device is especially helpful as the skilled manufacturing/metrology workforce is retiring as it gives new employees the ability to provide accurate information with little/no training. This innovation also gives the manufacturing companies an option to buy a new machine or upgrade their existing coordinate measuring machine. While the focus of this proposal is part identification, this technology has ready applications in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining, robotics, and automated assembly lines. This capability will make the US manufacturing sector stronger and more technologically advanced.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to develop a new technology to identify machined parts and assemblies. This technology will be implemented on coordinate measuring machines (CMM), which are used widely in the manufacturing sector to measure the shape and size of parts. The proposed technology will enable autonomous measurements of parts allowing a higher level of automation. In this identification technology, the team will use live images from a camera, multiple solid model/Computer Aided Design (CAD)-generated images, and advanced image processing. Applying Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) to the image processing of part images will ensure correct part identification. Correct identification of parts as seen by the camera is the remaining unsolved challenge to achieving self-driven automatic measurements of parts. Most machined parts are textureless and most of the information is contained in the edges. Current image processing techniques work well with texture-rich parts but are unreliable with textureless machined parts. AI/ML enhanced image processing using edge and shape information is a promising approach, solving this problem will lead to the birth of a new generation of CMMs that can measure parts automatically.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
