 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) programs. University of Connecticut is acquiring a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a broadband three-channel probe to support the research of Professor Christian Brueckner and colleague Mark Peczuh. In response to the solicitation for proposals to contribute to the recovery, recycle, and/or reuse of helium initiated by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, this award also includes a helium recovery system. This award facilitates research in the areas of nanoscale materials characterization, organic and inorganic chemistry, and biological sciences.  In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. Using the intrinsic magnetic properties of atomic nuclei, it is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The superconducting magnets of these instruments rely on regular deliveries of liquid helium to maintain their operation. However, the instability in the helium supply due to global and national challenges jeopardizes research programs relying on NMR spectroscopy. The helium recovery system collects the helium boiloff from the superconducting magnets and then reliquefies the helium for reuse. This award targets the enhancement of educational, research, and research training at all levels in multiple departments including several early career faculty and undergraduate and graduate students and in the surrounding community. This instrument is also used to propel the NMR-themed outreach program for local high school teachers and students.\r\n\r\nThis award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as chemistry, pharmacy, molecular and cellular biology, and engineering. Specifically, the instrument enables research focusing on the synthesis of small molecules exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence and the computational and experimental design of associating bottle brush mesostructures. Additional research projects to be enabled by the 400 MHz NMR spectrometer include the design and synthesize of new functional biomaterials, including modified natural polymers, such as Bombyx mori silk protein. Other research activities include the synthesis and photochemical characterization of azobenzene photoswitches; the systematic design, analysis and control of manufacturable nano-machines; and the examination of surface ligands and surface chemistry of metal nanoparticles. Other investigations include understanding how various cellular signaling pathways contribute to tumor onset and progression, and analyzing the design and synthesize of nucleic acid nanomaterials for a variety of medical applications. In response to global helium supply challenges the helium recovery system aids in helium conservation by recovering, recycling, and reliquefying the helium boil-off from this instrument and the existing NMR superconducting magnets at the institution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
