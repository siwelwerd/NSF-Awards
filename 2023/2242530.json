 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will partially support a Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Stochastic Physics in Biology, to be held in Ventura, CA, January 15-20, 2023.  The meeting aims to bridge stochastic physical theories with biological experiments by bringing together an outstanding and diverse group of physicists, mathematicians, engineers, and biologists at the forefront of research.  It will address emerging challenges in understanding complex behaviors of biological systems using principles and theories in stochastic physics. The conference is preceded by a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), a unique forum for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and other junior scientists to present new, unpublished research. The 2023 GRS in conjunction with the 2023 GRC Stochastic Physics in Biology is titled \u201cMultiscale processes of cellular organization\u201d.  \r\n\r\nThe conference is organized to optimize collaboration and communication among researchers from diverse disciplines. Sessions foster cross-disciplinary communication by including speakers from different disciplines, with introductions by discussion leaders that bridge the different disciplines. The program is organized around nine sessions that define the frontiers of Biological Physics: 1) Stochastic Physics in Gene Expression, 2) Sensing and Signaling, 3) Modeling if Cellular Processes, 4) Thermodynamics if Biological Systems, 5) Inference of Biological Models and Pathways, 6) Microbial Behaviors in Singles and Communities, 7) Pattern Formation in Biological Systems, 8) Growth and Development, and 9) Spatial Organization of Biological Functions and Activities.  The program promotes networking through scheduled and informal discussion times, poster sessions, social hours, and Power Hour \u2122.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this award include fostering interdisciplinary science, increasing the diversity, equity, and inclusivity (DEI) of the Biological Physics community, and the training and career development for early career researchers.  The 2023 GRC Stochastic Physics in Biology is committed to developing a diverse program and inclusive conference atmosphere. Participants were selected to ensure proportional representation of women and underrepresented minorities.  To increase the participation of underrepresented minority (URM) scientists at the meeting, the organizers will reach out to known URM networks: (1) the Black Women in Computational Biological Network, (2) Bouchett Honor Graduate Society, (3) Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science - SACNAS, (4) Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minoritized Scientists -ABRCMS, (5) UMBC Meyerhoff Scholars Program Alum Association, and (6) Black in Biophysics @BlackInBiophys/Twitter.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
