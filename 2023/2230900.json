 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Training Group (RTG)  in Geometry, Group Actions, and Dynamics at Wisconsin will train early career researchers in mathematics at the undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, and faculty levels in a manner designed specifically for mutual interaction and support between all levels. The training will prepare participants for further study, independent research, professional development, and careers in industry as well as the academy. The RTG will support undergraduate research conducted in collaboration with, and as an extension of, the Madison Experiment Mathematics Lab at Wisconsin, both in semester long programs as well as Summer Research Experiences.  It will provide support for graduate student research and professional development, and support for postdoctoral scholars, as well as running a series of research workshops and professional development seminars. All of this support will be augmented by the enhanced mentoring afforded by the RTG and will create professional connections and mentorship bonds across all levels. The affiliated faculty have extensive experience in professional development, outreach, and mentorship that promises to foster and support success from traditionally under-supported populations.\r\n \r\nThe academic expertise of the faculty affiliated with the RTG spans a wide array of topics in analysis, geometry, group actions, and dynamical systems.  Research conducted under the RTG will include topics such as statistical and dynamical properties of flat surfaces, the geometry of random subgroups of hyperbolic groups, the combinatorics of curves on surfaces, random groups, analysis on graphs, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics on moduli spaces. The research will be integrated into the professional development of all participants, creating interactions and mentorship between researchers at all levels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
