 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for participants in the 2023 East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium (ECOAS), which will be held October 21-22, 2023 on the Purdue University campus in West Lafayette, IN. The symposium provides a venue for early-career researchers to disseminate their findings at a national level, providing valuable career training and workforce development in STEM.  The symposium expects between fifty and seventy participants, including many graduate students and postdocs. This will be the nineteenth annual meeting in the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium series. The first meeting was held at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN in the Fall of 2003, and since then, meetings have been held each fall.\r\n\r\nThe East Coast Operator Algebras Symposium (ECOAS) is an annual conference focusing on operator algebras (C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras) and noncommutative geometry, with applications to a wide range of areas, including ergodic theory, number theory, representation theory, and mathematical physics. ECOAS enables participants to become acquainted with the forefront of research in operator algebras and noncommutative geometry and neighboring areas, while also providing early-career researchers with the opportunity to present their own work and to network and interact with each other as well as with more experienced researchers. Additional information can be found at the conference website: https://www.math.purdue.edu/~desantir/ecoas23/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
