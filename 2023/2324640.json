 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop brings together diverse public research institutions and other organizations to discuss and develop potential solutions to the challenges related to enhancing institutional research capacity at campuses that are not currently research intensive. The issues faced are varied and include outdated infrastructure, software, and methodology, as well as staffing shortfalls that lower their ability to support research. Participating emerging research institutions will benefit from the opportunity to learn from established research leadership and administrators at research-intensive institutions. The workshop will produce a working draft for a shared online resource support center that will provide users access to a helpdesk and other research administration resources in a broad effort to advance research capacity.          \r\n\r\n \r\nParticipating institutions include R1 to R2s, both rural and urban institutions, Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs), minority-serving institutions (MSIs), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Native American Serving Nontribal Institutions (NASNTIs), as well as Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) institutions. Each participant brings unique experiences and challenges to the conversation and provides valuable insight into creative solutions for mitigating barriers to research capacity. Workshop participants will be led through a challenge set format to identify common challenges and share available tools, knowledge, and effective practices with the overarching goals of enhancing competitiveness and catalyzing the development of new approaches and transformative ideas that are scalable, implementable, and collectively strengthen the nation\u2019s research enterprise. Upon completion of this conference, participating institutions will have identified possible challenges and mitigation strategies to research capacity building and drafted a framework needed for developing, implementing, and scaling a sustainable shared virtual resource center for use by research leadership, administration, and staff. In addition, each participant will have gained an improved understanding of how to engage in productive partnerships within and outside the institution to support the effective translation of research activity into commercial products and partnerships.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Research Capacity</em>\" project aimed to address challenges and mitigate barriers to enhancing research capacity at emerging research institutions (ERIs).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This project had three overarching goals: (1) Convene institutional and organizational stakeholders in research administration to identify and propose solutions to challenges or barriers to institutional research capacity in pre-award, post-award, compliance, and research development. &nbsp;(2) Create productive partnerships towards enhancing institutional research capacity.&nbsp; (3) Develop a framework for elements of a shared, virtual resource center and help desk.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p>\n<p>Broader impacts centered around two key aspects of the conference:&nbsp; (1) Bringing together stakeholders from diverse institutions and states to work together on an issue of great national importance.&nbsp; (2) Providing our participants the opportunity to engage and problem-solve common challenges in research administration towards the shared goal of enhancing institutional research capacity to be competitive in the global economy.&nbsp; Institutional research administrators and developers from 34 universities across 16 U.S. states attended the conference in addition to representatives from the National Organization of Research Development Professionals (NORDP), National Council of University Research Administrators (NCURA), and the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU).&nbsp; Attending institutions included multiple Hispanic Serving institutions, Historically Black Colleges&nbsp; and Universities, an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution, a Native American-Serving Nontribal Institution, and a Tribal University.&nbsp; Through surveys and one-on-one interviews, we found that attendees (&gt;90%) strongly agreed that the conference helped them understand where and how to connect with the research administration community, helped to grow their professional network, strengthened existing professional relationships among conference attendees, and provided the opportunity to receive and provide actionable feedback on barriers faced by their research institutions.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p>\n<p>The intellectual merit of this conference was demonstrated in the positive feedback we received from the participants.&nbsp; The capacity to leverage this collaborative opportunity among representatives of attending R1 institutions, ERIs, professional societies, and business development interests to create a support matrix for building and sustaining institutional research capacity was well-received.&nbsp; Survey results showed that our participants found the panelist discussions relatable and informative, particularly with regard to strategies for managing various stages of the research administration process.&nbsp; Additionally, respondents indicated that the group discussions were comfortable and inclusive.&nbsp; They produced meaningful insights regarding critical challenges and solutions that could be implemented at their home institutions and used to inform the continued development of the proposed virtual resource center. &nbsp;Most participants walked away from the experience with a better understanding of the initiative and were satisfied with their contributions to the challenge set activities and developing a framework for a shared virtual resource center and help desk.</p>\n<p><strong>Products:</strong></p>\n<p>Products
