 "awd_abstract_narration": "Karla Rosalia Sanchez Lievanos is awarded an NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (NSF MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and activities related to broaden participation by groups underrepresented in STEM. This fellowship to Dr. Sanchez Lievanos supports the research project entitled \u201cMPS-Ascend: Photoactive Metal-organic Nanocages for Sequestration and Degradation of Poly- and Perfluoroalkyl Substances\u201d under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host institution for the fellowship is the State University of New York at Buffalo, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Diana S. Aga.           \r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to utilize inorganic chemistry design principles to generate a safe prototype technology to remediate water pollution caused by ubiquitous and persistent poly and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The proposed work will develop robust porous and photoactive molecular nanocages with potential chemical affinity and catalytic activity for selective sequestration and photo-degradation of PFAS. The work will focus on studying the binding interactions between the nanocages and PFAS, evaluating the photo-induced reactivity of the nanocages to generate reactive oxygen species for PFAS decomposition, developing a mechanism of photo-degradation, and performing ecotoxicology studies on selected nanocages as part of a safe-by-design strategy for potential scale-up. Successful implementation of this work may allow for the development of functional materials that reliably and safely remove PFAS from water.\r\n\r\nThe PI intends to establish a partnership with the Buffalo Public School system to develop efficient tools to improve educational efficiency in underperforming Community Schools. The PI will join the Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper organization to offer seminars to underrepresented minority groups on water quality issues and remediation efforts. The PI will also partner with the International Younger Chemist Network to increase global participation in developing and understanding water remediation technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
