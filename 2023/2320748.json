 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award will provide funds to Northern Illinois University (NIU) to acquire, operate and maintain an Agilent 8700 Laser Direct Infrared (LDIR) Chemical Imaging System for detection of microplastics in the environment. Microplastics are ubiquitous in the environment. As the human population continues to increase, so too does the production of disposable packaging materials and single-use items. Microplastics are rapidly accumulating within our natural environment. The LDIR is a cutting-edge technology that provides a new method that advances our ability to detect microplastic particles, determine their size, and acquire detailed information about each particle type detected.  Microplastics will be examined from creation to detection, transport in the environment and into food webs, bioaccumulation in humans, impact on health, degradation, and finally environmental remediation. The LDIR will provide an excellent resource for training graduate and undergraduate students on both instrumentation and research projects in general. Graduate students will utilize this instrument for MS and PhD projects across multiple departments and colleges. Further, NIU has an undergraduate research-training program, Research Rookies that pairs undergraduates with interest in learning about science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) research with faculty working on research projects. NIU also hosts a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) that focuses on increasing diversity in the hydrosciences; projects for the REU will include microplastics.\r\n\r\nLDIR provides a new method for spectral analysis and chemical imaging. Utilizing the unique properties of the light source, a rapidly tunable Quantum Cascade Laser, the LDIR first scans the area of interest in the sample to determine the presence or absence and records the location of particles in the sample analysis area. It then examines each individual particle and obtains a spectrum, compares it to the spectral library for classification, and updates the results. The instrument will measure impacts of microplastics in different media (air, water, sediment) and lead the way in determining the impact of this contaminant of emerging concern. The multi-media and multi-scale nature of potential research projects utilizing the LDIR will make this a unique center.  Access to the LDIR will enable NIU researchers to form collaborations with regional, US-wide, and international teams working toward a better understanding of the fate and transport of microplastics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
