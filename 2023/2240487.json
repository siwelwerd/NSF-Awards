 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to create a commercial manufacturing method for a new class of environmentally friendly, sustainable biopesticides. Due to environmental and human health concerns, many traditional pesticides are heavily regulated or banned outright. Further, the demand for safe and reliable pest control is increasing.  One class of eco- and climate-friendly alternatives are biopesticides; They are safe for humans and the environment, face few restrictions on their use, and can be used for insect control in situations where traditional pesticides cannot, such as near homes or schools. The project scales a manufacturing platform for a new class of pheromones to enhance control of insect pests of various commodities such as during growth seasons in the soil and aboveground or postharvest, storage. The project could open up a new industry as pheromone enhancers of pest control have not been previously commercialized. Moreover, the project deliverables may enhance food security, provide climate-friendly solutions to farmers, and enhance sustainable agricultural practices. \r\n\r\nThe project scales nematode (roundworm) pheromone manufacturing using in vitro fermentation in bioreactors. Currently, no commercial nematode pheromone production exists. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are natural enemies of insects and are used as biological control agents for many economically important pests. Like many biopesticides, EPNs have limitations, such as variable efficacy (ability to kill) in the field and limited efficacy at temperature extremes. Nematode pheromone extracts increase EPN efficacy for insect control in soil by up to 78%. There is big commercial interest in EPN dispersal pheromones from EPN manufacturers and distributors. Since there is no commercial production system for nematode pheromones, new manufacturing methods are urgently needed. Previously, the fermentation method for pheromone production was demonstrated in shaker flasks. In the proposed project, the fermentation method will be scaled in bioreactors. In concert, downstream processing will be scaled for stable, active pheromone extracts. Field trials targeting important insect pests will be used to ensure pheromone activity, and the residual pheromone effects on the soil microbiome will be determined. Finally, methods will be developed to establish quality control parameters, formulation, storage, and packaging.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
