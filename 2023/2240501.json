 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of information processing has witnessed remarkable advancements, driven by both traditional computing technology and emerging quantum computing paradigms. Modern information processing technology, represented by classical computers, has revolutionized our lives, enabling us to connect with others, access vast amounts of information, and perform complex tasks efficiently. In parallel, quantum information processing has emerged as a promising frontier that offers unique capabilities beyond the classical limit. While still in its early stages, quantum information processing is poised to show great benefit for society in pursuits of optimizing logistical operations, discovery of novel medicines, and the preservation of secure communication of importance for national security. One of the major challenges in realizing practical quantum devices lies in scaling the number of quantum components on a platform. The proposed project aims to solve this problem by developing a new technology which rely on information carrying photons guided to an array of superconducting detectors to achieve a highly scalable device. Moreover, this project aims to contribute to the advancement of manufacturing techniques for quantum devices, fostering innovation and economic growth. By supporting this proposal, the National Science Foundation (NSF) will play a pivotal role in accelerating the development of quantum technology and positioning the United States at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field. Furthermore, the project will provide opportunities for education and diversity, as it will involve collaborations with academic institutions, training of students, and the promotion of interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThe research proposed here aims to address challenges in quantum photonic integrated circuits (QPICs) by integrating silicon-based waveguides with Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) to pioneer a scalable quantum information processor. The proposed approach seeks to overcome challenges in size, efficiencies, and scale by leveraging the frequency multiplexed readout inherent to kinetic inductance detectors, allowing large arrays to be lithographed with standard CMOS fabrication techniques. Using the evanescent field to facilitate optical information coupling between detectors and waveguides will significantly enhance detector efficiencies, while concurrently reducing size, weight, and cost by replacing table-top optical experiments with this innovative on-chip approach. The project's primary goals include the development of a robust and reliable fabrication process for integrating MKIDs with photonic circuits, the characterization of their performance in terms of system efficiencies, photon energy, number, and timing resolution, and the evaluation of their scalability potential. The research will involve a combination of theoretical modeling, device design, and extensive nanofabrication investigations. The intellectual significance of this project lies in the transformative impact it can have on the field of quantum technology, building up the technological framework required for large-scale, efficient, and reliable QPICs. Furthermore, this research will contribute to advancing the manufacturing techniques for quantum devices, thereby facilitating the translation of fundamental scientific advancements into \r\npractical applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
