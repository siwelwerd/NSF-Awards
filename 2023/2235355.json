 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by providing faculty professional development and support materials to post-secondary statistics instructors. The project looks to broaden and deepen the ability of these instructors to focus on the art and practice of statistical thinking. As post-secondary statistics course enrollments continue growing rapidly, there is an opportunity to expand the use of best practices in statistics and data science education. The increasingly diverse population of students engaging in data science and the increased role of data across disciplines further underscores the need for well-designed, modern statistics courses aligned with the 21st century workforce. The Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) have emphasized the need to teach statistics as an investigative process, with a focus on conceptual understanding, use of real data with context and purpose, effective use of technology, and high-quality assessments for learning. However, many post-secondary instructors are not yet familiar with GAISE, and many do not have formal training in statistics/data science or sufficient access to resources or professional networks. This Level III IUSE project in the Engaged Student Learning track will provide faculty professional development through intensive workshops, sustained interactions, formative assessment, and support materials to dramatically improve students\u2019 statistical education. This project will have substantial impact on instruction in the art and practice of statistical thinking, aligned with GAISE and current research on teaching and learning in statistics.\r\n\r\nOver the four-year period of the project, 24 instructor-facing workshops will be offered using a mix of in-person and virtual approaches, creating an expanded network of over 600 statistics educators. Participating instructors will be part of a sustained synchronous professional development program that includes social media interaction, blog/discussion board opportunities, and office hours to support instructors post-workshop. Furthermore, the project will produce freely-available materials for instructors to use in their classrooms. These free and widely disseminated materials will include instructor-facing videos, platform-independent applets, and other multi-media supports. The project will also generate and refine faculty and student materials based on feedback from participating instructors and insights from an internationally recognized advisory board. The 600 participating educators will directly impact over 75,000 students during the project period, with additional impact arising from dissemination of materials during and beyond the life of the project. Efforts are particularly focused on instructors reaching students with a broad selection of skills and backgrounds, leading to a substantial increase in the diversity of students developing their conceptual understanding of statistics. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
