 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital health has transformed the way health professionals operate, enabling them to improve patient experiences by delivering more efficient and effective care.  Collecting and utilizing health data has become a routine part of providing care and conducting research to enhance evidence-based medicine.  However, it is essential for health professionals to adapt and receive proper training to ensure the effective and ethical use of digital health technologies and tools. Current training programs have not kept pace with the rapid advancements in the healthcare landscape driven by smart technologies like smartwatches, mobile apps, and application of artificial intelligence to health data. These developments introduce new threats and vulnerabilities that can impact the privacy, security, and ethical use of health data. Health professionals who are trained in developing technologies play a crucial role in safeguarding the confidentiality and privacy of health data on a national scale. This project aims to bridge the gaps between cybersecurity advancements and the lack of practical understanding of real-world applications in the health professions. Specifically, it focuses on developing comprehensive training materials for students in master's level programs in health informatics, social work, and public health. \r\n\r\nThe project will develop three cybersecurity training modules tailored to health professionals. The training focuses on crucial areas, namely (1) foundations of applied cybersecurity customized for health data, (2) ethics, bias, and fairness in analysis and machine learning applied to health data, and (3) security and privacy on smart devices such as smartwatches and mobile health apps. Additionally, this project will develop sample interprofessional cybersecurity projects (use cases) that can be seamlessly integrated into capstone projects or fieldwork courses in health-related master\u2019s level programs. These use cases will serve as practical demonstrations of cybersecurity principles and their application in real-world scenarios. The training modules and use cases will be shared with outside collaborators in health informatics, social work, public health, and other health-related degree programs, as well as with the broader research community via a dedicated website. The research outcomes and findings will be disseminated in relevant conferences and journals within the fields of applied AI/ML, cybersecurity, and health sciences. This project will also increase participation of underrepresented groups in cybersecurity and health-related disciplines by providing tailored training, mentorship with role models and mentors \u201cwho look like me,\u201d and opportunities for meaningful engagement.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
