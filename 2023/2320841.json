 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description:\r\nThe acquisition of a tip-enhanced Raman spectroscope at San Jose State University (SJSU) can significantly improve our understanding of nanometer-scale materials and foster hands-on learning experiences for undergraduate and master's student researchers. The team at SJSU utilizes this optical instrument to tackle scientific challenges on materials science, with the materials for potential applications in transportation, energy storage, electronics, and health science. In addition, the instrument facilitates collaboration with external users in the area, including California State University - East Bay and the University of California - Merced. The acquisition also aims to advance high-quality public education for students, including those in underrepresented groups, thereby cultivating a highly trained and diverse science and engineering workforce in the United States.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThe acquired tip-enhanced Raman spectroscope integrates scanning probe microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, enabling scientists to determine molecular fingerprints and topography of nanomaterials down to 10 nanometer spatial resolution, which is a resolution level that could not be achieved using traditional optical measurement techniques. This combined analysis technique is also less invasive than some of the other techniques based on electron beams or X-rays, minimizing the sample damage and misinterpretation of the chemical and physical properties of nanomaterials. The researchers at SJSU apply this analysis technique to study quantum dot composites, biomaterials-driven interphase in batteries, quantum coherence properties in nanodiamonds, the effects of strain manipulation on transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures, and the effects of surface dipole moments on nitrogen-vacancy centers for quantum sensing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
