 "awd_abstract_narration": "This activity will increase student participation in the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2023) that will take place from December 1-4, 2023, by providing travel grants to U.S.-based students. The International Conference on Data Mining series has established itself as the world\u2019s premier research conference in data mining. It provides an international forum for presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative and practical development experiences. The conference covers all aspects of data mining, including algorithms, software and systems, and applications. This event provides an opportunity for US-based students to attend a premier conference in their research field overseas, present their research, exchange ideas and prepare future leaders in an important research area. In addition to enhancing student research careers. A strong representation of US researchers at the conference also help maintain US competitiveness in this important area.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ICDM conference series promotes novel, high-quality research findings, and innovative solutions to challenging data mining problems, and seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in data mining. ICDM draws researchers, application developers, and practitioners from a wide range of data mining related areas such as statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, databases, data warehousing, data visualization, knowledge-based systems, and high-performance computing. The event will include: i) student paper presentations, ii) a Student Forum, a iii) Women in Science Research Forum, and iv) a Networking with Experts event. These are meant to help the students and young researchers prepare for a career in scientific research, as well as broadening participation of women in computing, in particular in data mining research. The conference proceedings are published by the IEEE. The recipients of the NSF travel support will be listed at the ICDM 2023 conference website, together with additional ICDM 2023 information.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
