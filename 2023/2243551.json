 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 15th International Symposium on Particle Image Velocimetry (ISPIV 2023) will be hosted on campus of San Diego State University (SDSU) from June 19-21, 2023. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), benefited from the advancement in laser, camera, and computer technologies in the past four decades, has gradually evolved since its inception in 1984 into a dominant experimental method for scientific and applied research in fluid mechanics. During the process of the development, the ISPIV conference series have established themselves as the premier fora dedicated to the promotion of the PIV theory and technology. The conference series have been playing an indispensable role as an incubator and booster for scientists and researchers in advancing the state-of-the-art of the technologies on Particle Image Velocimetry.  Like the practice in the past, the ISPIV 2023 conference will again bring together leading scientists, researchers, developers and users of Particle Image Velocimetry from all over the world to examine, exchange and discuss all aspects of the latest innovative developments and applications related to Particle Image Velocimetry, with the aim to further advance the state-of-the-art of PIV theory, technology and practice. The proposed conference, featuring 3 keynote lectures and over 200 contributing papers, will provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art of PIV, and pave the way for a wide range of new and emerging developments such as machine learning and data assimilation. \r\n\r\nThe meeting will provide an opportunity for students and junior researchers to be educated with the latest developments in the research field of PIV and present their own recent research results at the conference.  The meeting will also invite researchers and students from underrepresented groups to present their research results and encourage their full participation and engagement in the conference so as to boost their career growth. The meeting will disseminate research results and promote the research areas through talks, webpages, flyers, posters, and proceedings, thus achieving positive impact to the society. Through encouraging participants\u2019 full engagement and fostering their new connections and collaborations, the symposium will bring lasting impacts on the advancement of Particle Image Velocimetry in the aforementioned areas of applications. Moreover, the symposium will help increase the public scientific literacy and engagement with science and technology through the conference proceedings, news coverage and in-depth interviews carried by both conventional and social media.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
