 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project strengthens pathways for underrepresented community college students to access biotechnology and biomanufacturing careers. It will do so by weaving together experiential learning activities, mentoring, and academic supports to bolster STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) awareness and opportunity. Activities are focused in the three major bioscience regions of California (Bay Area, Los Angeles/ Orange County, and San Diego), and include internship, pre-apprenticeship, and apprenticeship experience in biomanufacturing emerging technologies, creating a potentially replicable model for other states. Students gain hands-on experience and skills needed in emerging biotechnologies while working toward career goals. Participation in STEM cohort activities will help students from groups underrepresented in STEM gain confidence and see biotechnology careers as option for their futures. They will have the opportunity to help society increase sustainability and reduce environmental impact by contributing to new solutions for safe production of food, medicines, and therapeutics.  Industries benefit by meeting growth demands with an inclusive, diverse, and skilled workforce aligned with regional economies.  \r\n\r\nThis biomanufacturing internship project lead by MiraCosta Community College plans to expand interest in, knowledge of, and employability of community college students in emerging technology biomanufacturing careers.  Community colleges are at the heart of robust pathways to successful careers in biomanufacturing that offer individuals both lateral and upward mobility. Community college certificate and degree programs provide students with practical knowledge and transferable technical and professional skills in biotechnology and biomanufacturing. This knowledge will be strengthened through hands-on experiential learning activities conducted at partner locations that will provide students with the skills, training, and mentoring to build confidence and prepare them for internships and apprenticeships in emerging biotechnologies. This project will help to create a sense of STEM identity among students, through peer-to-peer connections, presentations, and virtual workshops. The project taps into a network of college, industry, and workforce development partners throughout the state of California to establish internship, pre-apprenticeship, and apprenticeship opportunities for students.  Measurable outcomes include impact of mentorship and micro-internships on retention, completion, and employment for diverse students. This project aligns with the NSF ExLENT Program, funded by the NSF TIP and EDU Directorates, as it seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for individuals from diverse professional and educational backgrounds to increase their interest in, and their access to, career pathways in emerging technology fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
