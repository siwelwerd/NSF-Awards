 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Division of Chemistry and co-funding from the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, Dr. Justin Douglas at the University of Kansas is implementing a helium recovery system that will capture, purify, and liquefy helium gas exhaust produced by the normal operation of nine scientific instruments used in research with broad societal impacts in fields such as chemistry, engineering, and pharmacy. For example, the superconducting magnets of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometers need periodic refills of liquid helium to maintain persistent magnetic fields. Severe shortages of helium have forced the mothballing of some instruments, which adversely impacts many NSF-funded and other projects throughout the region. Responsible resource utilization that minimizes waste by recycling gaseous helium exhaust protects present research activities and preserves this non-renewable resource, enabling future generations to continue to advance national and global health, prosperity, and welfare. Furthermore, information about the requested equipment is being integrated into a comprehensive outreach effort to engage individuals from underrepresented groups, recruit and retain faculty, staff and students, and enhance the classroom and research environment at the University of Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe nine instruments being served by the helium recovery equipment are distributed across four separate buildings. Successful execution of this project demonstrates the feasibility of a hub-and-spoke model for other institutions needing to recover helium from dispersed devices. This project involves 1) fabrication of manifolds using off-the-shelf parts to collect helium exhaust without disturbing instrument operation; 2) short-term storage of helium in 8500-liter bags; 3) compression of collected gas into high-pressure cylinders for transport to a centralized facility on campus; 4) purification and liquefaction of the gas; and 5) reuse of the resulting liquid helium in scientific instruments. In one year of operation, it is estimated that ~2,400 liters of liquid helium will be recycled by this system. This recovered helium will be used to refill superconducting NMR magnets and to supply the cryostats of Electron Paramagnetic Resonance and Magnetic Circular Dichroism spectrometers. This helium recovery system will secure essential supplies for scientific instrumentation that plays a crucial role in NSF-funded and other research projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
