 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent decades have witnessed an extraordinary growth in cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as self-driving vehicles, robotic devices, and drones. The First EAI SmartSP2023 conference, an independent conference, provides a valuable venue for the cyber-physical systems (CPS) research, with a particular focus on smart vehicles, smart transportation, and corresponding security challenges. The conference brings together leading experts worldwide to share knowledge, explore emerging trends and technologies, and address the many challenges associated with these technologies. The conference is particularly relevant for students and early-career researchers seeking to expand their knowledge, develop essential career skills, and engage in discussions with leading experts in the field. Attendees will have the opportunity to attend technical sessions, present their research, and participate in panel discussions and networking events. The conference will also provide opportunities for students to meet with leading experts in the field, explore potential career opportunities, and gain valuable insights into the latest research and emerging technologies in CPS and smart vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe conference grant helps cover travel expenses for student attendees. The selection will be based on a range of criteria, including academic achievement and research experience and will give priority to students who have demonstrated a commitment to advancing the field. Assessment of learning outcome for student attendees will be conducted through a range of methods, including pre- and post-conference surveys, feedback from student presentations, and evaluations of student engagement in technical sessions and discussions. The conference organizers will work with participating universities and research institutions to ensure that students receive credit for attending the conference and that their participation is recognized as part of their academic and professional development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
