This meeting will be attended by undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, as well as senior researchers to discuss our understanding of all aspects of these bacteria.  NSF will support discussions on the understanding of the structure, biochemistry, genetics of this phylum of bacteria that have a unique surfaces structure.  Talks will be presented on fundamental properties of Staphylococci, their interactions with other microscopic creatures, and how their genes regulate these aspects of Staphylococcal biology.  In addition to formal talks presented by experienced researchers and trainees new to the field, engagement will be facilitated by two poster sessions to stimulate interactions between researchers.  NSF support will be used to defray registration costs to allow attendance of participants from early stages of their careers, especially for members of groups underrepresented in this field.\r\n\r\nStaphylococci are members of the Gram-positive phylum of bacteria, with an envelope comprised of a single membrane and thick cell wall, unlike most other bacteria.  This thick cell wall has made it difficult to study some aspects of these creatures, and is an important feature that allows them to infect mammalian hosts.  This Gordon Conference and Seminar will allow discussion of the newest research on the structure and biochemistry of these tiny creatures, including understanding of their role unique biochemistry, their interactions within the microbial community, and how their signaling and gene regulation.  The meeting will bring together experienced investigators with early-career scientists in both formal talks and discussion sessions to encourage informal discussion and sharing of latest research results on the formation of structures in the cell, cell wall structure and absorption of nutrients, and their interactions with other communities of microbes in biofilms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
