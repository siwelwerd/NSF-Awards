 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a study of the physics of rotating magnetized plasmas observed in many astrophysical systems and laboratory experiments.  New observational discoveries about black holes and accretion disks increasingly uncover that our universe is immersed in magnetized plasma, an ionized and electrically conducting gas. One of the mysteries in the astrophysical rotating systems has been the rate at which matter accretes from astrophysical disks onto a central body, such as a black hole. The angular momentum redistribution in these systems is observed to be far too rapid to be explained by known physical mechanisms. The resolution may be in the interaction between the rotating plasma and the magnetic field via the so-called Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI). This instability leads to stretching and folding of magnetic field lines that connect the rotating plasma elements and contribute to the enhancement of turbulent angular momentum transport.  This project will explore the MRI mechanism and associated magnetized plasma instabilities via three-dimensional computer simulations, with potential implications for improved understanding of both astrophysical and laboratory plasmas, including novel plasma confinement concepts for fusion energy development.\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate key physical effects of global space and magnetic curvature in a rotating magnetized plasma which have not previously been taken into account.  In particular,  the subject of this study will be the onset and sustainment of three-dimensional non-axisymmetric perturbations in differentially rotating systems where exponentially growing axisymmetric MRI modes could be a partial driver. The question to be addressed is whether in a domain with spatial curvature global non-axisymmetric modes with real frequencies can persist.  Distinct global modes, which are Alfven-continuum-driven modes due to global differential rotation and magnetic curvature, have recently been discovered.  These are so-called magneto-curvature instability modes. Using both global simulations in a flow-driven media and analytical calculations, this project will investigate (1) the onset of the magneto-curvature global modes in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and Hall MHD regimes; and (2) the effect of these global modes on momentum transport, reconnection, and dynamo.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
