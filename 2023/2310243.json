 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professor Alexander Monin at the University of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nQuantum Field Theory (QFT) has played a pivotal role in our understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe for nearly a century. The Standard Model of particle physics, which is based on QFT, has been a remarkable achievement. However, there are still unresolved questions within the Standard Model that require further investigation. The complexity of QFT poses a challenge in answering these questions. While systems with a small number of weakly interacting particles can be effectively studied, systems influenced by strong forces, such as the constituents of a proton, or systems with large numbers of particles, present significant obstacles to systematic description. Such systems are called \"non-perturbative\", and addressing these non-perturbative systems represents one of the biggest challenges in 21st-century theoretical physics. In this project, Professor Monin will develop new methods and improve existing methods that are specifically tailored to addressing these non-perturbative systems. By advancing our understanding of the structure of QFT and employing these methods, insight is gained into the unanswered questions within the Standard Model of particle physics. This research endeavors to promote the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the theoretical understanding of nature and the mechanisms underlying its laws. By shedding light on these mysteries, this project serves the national interest by advancing our knowledge and contributing to the overall progress of scientific discovery.  Furthermore, this project aims to attract and involve students, providing them with valuable training and fostering their growth as successful researchers. \r\n\r\nMore technically, this project is divided into three parts: QFT Structure, New Methods and Techniques, and Particle Physics. The milestones of this project include studying processes involving multiple quanta, enhancing existing techniques like Hamiltonian truncation and resurgence to address realistic systems, and applying known methods such as dispersion relations to study phenomena accessible by current and future Intensity Frontier experiments. Through these efforts, Professor Monin seeks to advance our theoretical understanding of QFT, thereby enabling the analysis of non-perturbative phenomena. Additionally, this research project is designed to have a broader impact beyond high-energy physics. A deeper understanding of the structure of QFT will benefit any field utilizing QFT.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
