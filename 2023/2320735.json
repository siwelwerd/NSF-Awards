 "awd_abstract_narration": "A high-performance computing (HPC) cluster is being built through a collaborative endeavor to support computation- and data-intensive applications at Hofstra University, Adelphi University, and Nassau Community College. The cluster will provide an environment that enables faculty and students to engage in computer-related teaching, learning, and research activities that were not previously feasible in an academic setting for a variety of disciplines. All of the major users who conduct research on the HPC cluster will leverage its capabilities to address long-standing questions in their fields to advance knowledge and explore creative, potentially transformative concepts with this cutting-edge technology.\r\n\r\nThe utility of a high-performance computing cluster to the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields is critical and will support the research and teaching of more than twenty major users of the equipment, being an interdisciplinary and collaborative group of faculty spread across six departments at Hofstra University, Adelphi University, and Nassau Community College. The impact of an on-site HPC cluster for research is exemplified by some of the main areas of research to be addressed, including 1) revealing the structural impact of electron solvation on molecules, 2) modeling acceptor-acceptor interactions in p-doped semiconductors in support of acceptor-spin-based quantum computation, 3) artificial neural network and accelerator co-design using evolutionary algorithms, and 4) autonomous wound closure employing advanced magnetic technology in the form of \u201cprintable\u201d magnets.\r\n\r\nFrom biology, physics, and chemistry to computer science and engineering, the multidisciplinary utility of a HPC cluster is vital to continued exploration and advancement. Each major user of the HPC cluster will involve undergraduate students in computer laboratory experiments, and laboratory classes will be able to model and simulate systems that were impossible previously. The outreach of the HPC cluster will also include high school student research and teaching experiences through the Hofstra University Summer Science Research Program. Some of the projects conducted by the major users will be converted into course-based undergraduate research experiences.\r\n\r\nThe HPC cluster will be maintained through the course of the grant and thereafter in the Science and Innovation Center at Hofstra University. The website for the HPC cluster will be www.hofstra.edu/starhpc and will be updated regularly with information pertaining to research projects, major users, and class curriculum involving the HPC cluster. A detailed explanation of the HPC cluster, the information needed to use the HPC Cluster, and how to become a user will be provided on the website.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
