 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research. The University of Montana is acquiring a 600 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance probe, a double-resonance broadband probe, a variable temperature unit, and an automated sample changer to support the research of Professor Bruce Bowler and his colleagues: Klara Briknarova, Orion Berryman, Travis Hughes, and Daniel Decato. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of structural biology, biophysics, supramolecular chemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in several departments at the University of Montana. It will directly impact the research of 12 laboratories and will impact students in two upper division lab courses and several graduate courses. The new instrument will also be available for use by regional tribal colleges in Montana and surrounding states.\r\n\r\nThis award is aimed at supporting research and education at all levels. The 600 MHz NMR spectrometer coupled to the triple-resonance probe will be used for evaluating rational mutations for stabilizing proteins and for studying the structure and dynamics of Fibronectin. The double resonance broadband probe will serve research efforts employing fluorine NMR to study nuclear receptors. This probe will also enhance studies of abiotic foldamers through proton-fluorine NMR correlation experiments. The variable temperature capabilities will expand the scope of the studies surrounding transient high valent first row transition metal complexes designed to activate carbon-hydrogen bonds. The autosampler will permit high throughput evaluations of ligand protein interactions using saturation-transfer difference (STD) NMR elucidating fundamental ligand binding events with C-type Lectin receptors. The 600 MHz NMR system will also serve a variety of users within the disciplines of medicinal chemistry, natural products, materials science, and polymer chemistry. In response to global helium supply challenges, the acquisition of this instrument includes a superconducting magnet with a low loss cryostat reducing the institution\u2019s consumption of helium.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
