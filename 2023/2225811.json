 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the nations indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging rewarding careers in STEM-related fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. Sustainability of capacity gains is significantly enhanced by retaining the talent of credentialed STEM faculty. This project aligns directly with that goal.\r\n\r\nFort Peck Community College (FPCC) is expanding its capacity in geography and environmental sciences classes by adding a GIS Technology Certificate in Applied Science. The certificate will prepare FPCC students for relevant employment, thereby addressing workforce needs. The certificate is centered on an experiential-based learning environment as the underlying approach to increase the participation of underrepresented Native college students in the STEM fields of study and eventually STEM careers. The project combines existing GIS and environmental science course work with hands-on technology in experiential-based learning processes to heighten the interest and participation of FPCC students in STEM-related fields. Further, giving students tools that can be used to protect, preserve, and monitor the cultural resources of the tribes creates an environment of usefulness. Moreover, providing opportunities in STEM studies for students who are tribal members or descendants can strengthen tribal governance, oversight, and economic well-being.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
