 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI), the Chemistry Research Instrumentation, and Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) programs. The University of California at Berkeley is developing an instrument which incorporates nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and an optical fluorescence spectrometer to support the research of Professor Ashok Ajoy along with colleague Jeffery Reimer. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of materials science, quantum information science, energy storage, and catalysis.  This development project enables the simultaneous manipulation of electronic and nuclear spins of proteins, materials, and molecular systems employing the ability to rapidly transport the sample from low to high or high to low magnetic fields at cryogenic temperatures.  By combining the three spectroscopic techniques, the instrument enables users to perform cutting-edge dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) techniques which significantly improve the sensitivity of magnetic resonance experiments for the thorough characterization of the properties of molecular systems. Students and trainees from the undergraduate to postdoctoral level are involved in the development and testing of the instrument. The completed instrument benefits a wide array of research groups and undergraduate students, including those from diverse backgrounds and from a predominately undergraduate institution in the Bay Area, San Jose State University. Multiple investigators from additional universities and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory also benefit from this resource.\r\n\r\nThis award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels.  The instrument enables the development of an optical dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) NMR system to study metal-organic frameworks. The instrumentation is also used to probe electrons optically and via spin resonance to uncover the role of interactions with their nuclear environment and thereby enable the study of molecular systems for applications in quantum information science.  Additionally, the instrument enables the investigation of the chemical surface structure of bulk and nanoscale materials for enhanced quantum sensors and the development of a sub-micron scale NMR in-situ chemical probe within microdroplets using nuclear spin in nanodiamonds as quantum sensors. The instrument also allows the unique ability to simultaneously probe EPR active systems and perform in-situ DNP measurements of light-harvesting complexes within photosystems. Furthermore, by using the three modalities, this instrument aids in understanding the interplay between the electron g-factor and the resulting optically pumped NMR spectra in bulk or heterostructured semiconductors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
