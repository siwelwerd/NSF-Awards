 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a magnetoelastic generator (MEG) bracelet for cardiac monitoring. Current devices need an external power supply and intermittent charging and provide monitoring for up to two months.  Implantable devices can do so for two years.  In contrast, the proposed bracelet employs a self-powered two-step energy conversion method that continuously transforms pulses into high-fidelity, analyzable electrical signals without requiring a power source. This allows for uninterrupted monitoring.  Currently used devices are not continuous and inconvenient to use because they require the patient to measure their pulse deliberately.  The proposed device's continuous data collection feature eliminates the problems of battery drainage and intermittent charging periods. Additionally, this device may be used as a non-invasive and continuous diagnostic tool.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a device to monitor atrial fibrillation. It uses human arterial pulse waves and converts them into high-fidelity and analyzable electrical signals, working in a self-powered manner. The device utilizes the giant magnetoelastic effect in soft systems, making it adaptable for wearable bioelectronics. The proposed textile wearable magnetoelastic generator (MEG) consists of two types of fibers and operates on a two-step energy conversion, including mechanical-to-magnetic and magnetic-to-electrical conversions. A weaving of those fibers will complete the cycle of mechanical-to-electrical conversion. This makes the device self-powered and eliminates the need for an external power source such as a battery. In addition, since magnetic fields can pass through water without significant performance loss, the device is intrinsically waterproof. Previous research testing the efficiency of the materials and reliability of the MEG in-vitro compared favorably with traditional blood pressure monitors with a 1.2% difference. In addition, the proposed technology may be implemented to measure heart rate, respiratory rate, and movements, leading to the development of more accurate, efficient, and non-invasive diagnostic tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
