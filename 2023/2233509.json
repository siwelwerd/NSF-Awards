 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Society for Microbiology\u2019s (ASM\u2019s) Microbiology Leaders Evolving and Accountable to Progress (mBio LEAP) project is designed to support and elevate inclusive diversity with equity, access, and accountability (IDEAA). IDEAA is ASM\u2019s holistic approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The mBio LEAP project is meant to elevate IDEAA within the microbial sciences and across the broader science, technology, engineering, and mathematics community (STEM) and will complement ASM\u2019s existing programs, such as the Future Leaders Mentoring Fellowship (FLMF) and the Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minoritized Scientists (ABRCMS). While FLMF and ABRCMS work to empower and mentor scientists from historically underrepresented groups, mBio LEAP will empower leaders within the microbial sciences to influence the cultures and climates of their respective sectors and organizations. The mBio LEAP project seeks to educate and train leaders in IDEAA, increasing their skills and ability to drive change. By focusing on leaders, mBio LEAP will increase the potential for organizational change and the embodiment of IDEAA principles at ASM and across the microbial sciences.\r\n\r\nThe mBio LEAP project will work with leaders by (1) promoting deep individual introspection, (2) facilitating peer group exchanges, and (3) providing a space where participants can practice knowledge and skills to ensure the training goes beyond awareness to action. The project goals are to expand intercultural awareness, transform practices, and encourage and inspire microbiology leaders to embrace and promote IDEAA. The project will use a training-of-leaders (ToL) model to provide a structure for long-term sustainability and engagement in IDEAA, connecting with leaders through an interactive, peer-group format to cultivate knowledge and understanding. The ToL program will strive to increase participants' awareness and understanding of IDEAA, develop best practices for integrating IDEAA in STEM, and promote IDEAA within the microbial sciences. The project\u2019s three objectives are to (1) design and develop the IDEAA ToL program and curriculum, (2) recruit participants and pilot the ToL program and curriculum, and (3) revise the IDEAA ToL program and curriculum resources using a mixed-method design. The project\u2019s design phase will produce a curriculum and resources for a comprehensive, data-driven, scalable ToL program that will enable the participating leaders to serve as IDEAA change agents. The program's resources will be open source and disseminated within the microbiology and STEM communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
