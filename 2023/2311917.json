Student attendance at S&P is an important part of graduate education in cybersecurity. The 2023 Symposium will be held in San Francisco, CA and consist of approximately 150 technical papers and Systematization of Knowledge papers, which provide valuable background to students who are learning the literature.\r\n\r\nThis grant provides travel support to encourage participation in the IEEE Symposium and its Student Program Committee by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
