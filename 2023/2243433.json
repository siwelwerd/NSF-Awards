 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need to prepare highly trained STEM teachers for rural schools that often lack the resources for advanced science and math coursework and support for associated technologies. Through specialized knowledge and experiences, prospective teachers will learn how to address the specific challenges and opportunities of rural schools and students by providing innovative and creative secondary science and math courses. This will prepare rural students to pursue STEM disciplines in college and the workplace. The need for a strong, well trained and educated STEM workforce is a national priority, and a high-quality, equitable high school STEM education provides the foundation for future generations to succeed in these much-needed fields. \r\n\r\nThis project at Juniata College includes partnerships with five local districts who are rural and high-needs including Altoona Area School District, Huntingdon Area School District, Mount Union School District, Juniata Valley School District and Tyrone Area School District. In addition to the collaboration among the College\u2019s math, sciences, and education departments, Science in Motion, a project originally funded by NSF will also assist in training the prospective teachers. This project will provide scholarships over five years for 24 Juniata undergraduate junior and senior STEM majors to pursue teacher certification credentials. The prospective teachers will be trained in culturally relevant and sustaining educational practices to ensure they provide and champion an equitable educational opportunity for all students. The undergraduate scholars will have the opportunity to pursue summer research in their respective STEM fields in addition to extensive educational field placements in rural settings. The project will be evaluated through survey instruments, tracking of participation in activities, and  interviews with the prospective teachers, placement supervisors, and other mentors. The dissemination of lessons learned and training in culturally relevant practices will be shared at state and national conferences. In addition, the prospective teachers will also share their research findings at appropriate conferences, highlighting how actively engaging in STEM research will enhance their future classrooms. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
