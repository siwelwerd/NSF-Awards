 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) Committee on Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Sciences (CAMOS), providing an independent forum for identifying and discussing issues in atomic, molecular, and optical sciences among the research community, the federal government, and the interested public, thereby serving as a unifying force in this diverse and varied field. CAMOS's scope also includes appropriate cross-disciplinary areas and consideration of budget and programmatic aspects of the implementation of the decadal survey undertaken by federal agencies.\r\n\r\nThe NASEM CAMOS will operate as an ad-hoc committee to support scientific progress in atomic, molecular, and optical sciences and to assist the federal government in planning programs in these fields by providing advice on the implementation of decadal survey recommendations. CAMOS will assess progress on the most recent decadal survey of the field, and monitor the progress of its recommended priorities and critical scientific and technical activities.  When requested by a funding agency and approved by the National Academies, CAMOS may write reports to address issues associated with the Decadal report to provide agencies with timely advice on agency progress and implementation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
