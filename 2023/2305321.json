 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference award provides partial support for The Society of Molecular Biology and Evolution Satellite Meeting on De Novo Gene Birth, to be held in College Station, TX on November 6-9, 2023. De novo gene birth is a recently discovered genetic process responsible for generating new genes with important biological roles, such as human brain function and pest resistance in crops. Research on de novo genes is critical to our understanding of species evolution and has a growing impact on medical sciences, including cancer biology. This international meeting will stimulate sharing of new knowledge and foster collaborative efforts across a variety of biological disciplines. The conference will offer outstanding networking and training opportunities for young researchers representing the future STEM workforce. \r\n \r\nDe novo genes evolve from ancestrally noncoding DNA sequences and are ubiquitous across the tree of life. Research in this area encompasses a range of disciplines and has informed on broader phenomena in biological sciences, including the evolution of cellular networks, the emergence of new protein folds and domains, and the accuracy of gene annotation. The rapid increase of genome sequences and high-throughput proteomic datasets is providing the wealth of information necessary to address fundamental issues in de novo gene origin and function. As the first large scientific gathering on de novo gene birth, this conference will accelerate advances in de novo gene evolution, function, and annotation, and enable developing the conceptual and empirical frameworks that will guide investigations in this area for the foreseeable future. The meeting will provide opportunities for early-career researchers to present their work and establish a broader professional network with internationally recognized scholars in molecular evolution, genomics, proteomics, cell biology and bioinformatics. The funding provided by NSF includes support to trainees from historically underrepresented groups in science with the goal of broadening participation to the meeting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
