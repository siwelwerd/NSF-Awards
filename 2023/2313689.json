 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks better understanding of monsoon thunderstorm activity and precipitation in the Southwest. The project creates an innovative machine learning tool trained using regional numerical weather model output and satellite remote sensing data (the predictors) with respect to known thunderstorm cell locations and intensities detected by radar (the targets). The tool will be designed to extract important fundamental relationships between the predictors and targets that help explain the development and evolution of thunderstorms. After an intense training, validation and testing phase, the relationships will then be leveraged to generate better forecasts of the timing, severity and location of future thunderstorm events in the Southwest. The tool will be shared with the National Weather Service to help forecasters predict thunderstorm-related hazards such as large hail, flash flooding or wildfire ignition. This innovative approach will also provide a framework for improving operational meteorological and geophysical prediction systems and for guiding scientific field studies.\r\n\r\nThe project develops a probabilistic model to predict convective initiation, rain rates, and convective cell tracks during the wet phase of the North American Monsoon (NAM). Predictors of convection (e.g., relative humidity, convective available potential energy, precipitable water) will be collected from dynamic mesoscale model (High Resolution Rapid Refresh, University of Arizona-Weather Research Forecast model) analyses and forecasts and combined with new satellite-derived observations of soil moisture and surface temperature to produce a unique prediction tool. A novel machine learning approach \u2013 causality informed learning \u2013 will be applied to identify the most suitable predictors for further training in a neural network and to gain insight into the processes governing convective initiation and evolution. Hourly forecasts of precipitation occurrence, nature, and categorical rain rates will be produced operationally to guide forecasters and field research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
