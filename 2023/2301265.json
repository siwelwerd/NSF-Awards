 "awd_abstract_narration": "The demand for Information Technology (IT) professionals in Wyoming (and nationally) continues to outpace many other technical and STEM fields. In Wyoming, the need for Computer User Support Specialists, Network and Computer Systems Administrators, Information Security Analysts, Computer Network Support Specialists, Datacenter Technicians and Data Analysts outpace all other IT positions in the state. Employment growth projections in the IT field demonstrate positional growth of nearly 14,000 positions in the Laramie County Community College (LCCC) region. This project will help address the demand for IT professionals by improving access, inclusion, and persistence in community college IT coursework. Through the proposed activities, the IT pathway will broaden its impact on underserved populations, while preparing qualified, skilled, and diverse professionals to benefit the regional workforce and assist with Wyoming\u2019s goal of diversifying its economy.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to expand access for rural/remote students, engage and retain underserved populations and emphasize the advanced skills/certifications required to promote marketability in an increasingly competitive field. Specific activities include the deployment of a self-sustaining student resource model, that will ensure rural/remote students are equipped with computing equipment consistent to that of industry and can participate in practical lab exercises to prepare them for career expectations. Recruitment and experiential learning activities will focus on engaging and retaining women and career-changing adults in the IT Pathway. Summer bootcamps and a fully remotely accessible IT Professional Club will be utilized to increase student participation, collaboration, and success. Project deliverables will be communicated and shared with other Wyoming community colleges, as well as nationally and uploaded to ATE Central, including aggregated data on the assessment of recruitment of females and rural/remote students and their performance in the IT Pathway. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
