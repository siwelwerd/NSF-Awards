 "awd_abstract_narration": "Learning a new motor skill involves complex interactions between how we perceive the world around us and how we perceive the parts of our body. For example, learning to use a computer mouse involves linking a cursor on a screen to the brain\u2019s representation of the hand. This project will examine the processes underlying such changes in body representation, how changes are retained over time, and how they generalize to other contexts. This is particularly important for any application that involves modification of the body representation, such as when using prosthetic devices or moving in virtual reality. For example, the results should provide a basis for training technicians in industrial, military, or medical settings to operate a telerobotic interface so that the learned changes in body representation remain stable over time and so the operator can quickly adapt when in an untrained activity. The investigator will also empower students to explore STEM careers: a free virtual summer camp, \u201cGirls with Nerve,\u201d will be offered to high school girls from a large and diverse school district in Indianapolis, along with in-person laboratory visits during the school year that are open to all students.\r\n\r\nChanges in the brain\u2019s representation of the body during skill learning have been little investigated, compared with changes in the movement itself. An important innovation of this project is to test changes in body representation using both body position sense (proprioception), which arises from sensors in the muscles, and visual signals, which arise from viewing one\u2019s own moving body. Integration of sensory signals from multiple sources (multisensory integration) is a fundamental property of the brain. Through a series of reaching and perception experiments, the researchers will determine the multisensory factors that contribute to the updates in body representation that are important for skill learning. Results will inform a theoretical framework of sensorimotor control that accounts for both multisensory perception and motor learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
