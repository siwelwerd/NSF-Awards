 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds to support students and junior faculty for travel to the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2023), which will take place in Melbourne, Australia in May, 2023. ICSE is the flagship conference in the field of Software Engineering. The grant will provide travel and registration support for students. The ICSE conference this year will have a doctoral symposium, student mentoring workshop, and a new faculty symposium. Conference attendance is important for the technical exchange of information and research conversations/collaborations made possible by the conference, as well as advances in the field made possible by these interactions. The conference provides opportunities for education, training and mentoring to build the next generation of researchers and practitioners in the field of software engineering.   The international nature of this conference helps develop a globally-aware workforce of research and educators within the US and helps build the community of researchers in the field of Software Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
