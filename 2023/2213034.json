 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients suffering from complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI). Today, cUTIs account for 400,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States. Unfortunately, multidrug resistant pathogens are a common cause of cUTI. Many are resistant to the first-line antibiotic (Ceftriaxone), which is used as the empiric treatment of this condition. However, the high incidence of multidrug resistant pathogens causing cUTI delays the time until patients receive more appropriate treatment. Delayed time to appropriate therapy in cUTI has been attributed to extended hospital stays and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The current standard test for diagnosing a drug-resistant cUTI takes 2-3 days from obtaining a patient sample. Therefore, diagnostic tests that can rapidly inform the initial treatment of UTIs are urgently needed to improve patient care.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a rapid urinary diagnostic test that will enable the detection of ceftriaxone-resistant uropathogens. Early detection of resistance to first-line therapies would enable antibiotic prescribing to be informed, reducing the risk of disease progression in patients. In the case of UTIs, disease progression can lead to severely invasive infections, predominately sepsis. Therefore, diagnostics that can detect resistance to first-line antibiotics enable early treatment interventions, reducing the time to appropriate treatment and reducing the risk of disease progression. Decreased treatment time also lowers the healthcare costs associated with drug-resistant cUTI, as disease progression is associated with increased lengths of hospital stays compared to susceptible infections. The completion of the Phase II project will yield the development of a prototype test that can provide actionable information regarding ceftriaxone susceptibility in less than 5 minutes. This project\u2019s success will provide clinicians with a diagnostic solution for cUTIs that can be acted on immediately to improve patient outcomes and aid antibiotic stewardship by preventing the unnecessary use of inappropriate antibiotics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
