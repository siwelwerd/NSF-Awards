 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants are colonized by thousands of microscopic organisms, from bacteria to tiny animals like nematode worms.  These microorganisms affect each other\u2019s interactions with their shared host plant. Some make it easier for other microorganism to infect the host, while others prevent other microorganisms from successfully infecting. This research will investigate whether these interactions between microorganisms on the same host plant are due to resource competition or driven by the host\u2019s immune response. The researchers will test these questions in a plant that is closely related to alfalfa. Like alfalfa, this plant relies on symbiotic bacteria that live within cells in the root for nitrogen - an important nutrient and a main ingredient in fertilizers. While these symbiotic bacteria provide an essential nutrient to the plant, they also make their host more vulnerable to infection by parasitic nematode worms. While this research focuses on a single species of plant, nearly all crop plants rely on symbiotic microbes for nutrients, so understanding how beneficial microbes influence the disease risk of their host is agriculturally relevant and ecologically significant. The broader impacts of this project include providing interdisciplinary training for the next generation of leaders in plant science; engaging undergraduate and high-school students from under-represented backgrounds in hands-on research; and developing a board game based on microbial colonization of plant roots.\r\n\r\nMicroorganisms that share the same host affect each other\u2019s colonization success. Cross-talk between co-colonizing microorganisms often manifests as a priority effect, in which an early encounter with one microorganism impacts the host\u2019s response to later colonizers. This research will test two competing hypotheses to explain pervasive priority effects in host-associated communities: a defense-centered model, in which the host\u2019s defense response to one invader has off-target effects on infection by another organism, and a resource-centered model, in which co-colonizers compete for host resources. This project will test these hypotheses in the model legume Medicago truncatula by experimentally infecting plants with a parasitic nematode that disrupts the symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Nematodes inhibit rhizobia colonization, while the rhizobia increase susceptibility to nematodes. The proposed research has five objectives: (1) determine the spatio-temporal scale of priority effects between rhizobia and nematodes and develop new tools to manipulate them; interrogate the relative roles of (2) defense and (3) carbon allocation in generating priority effects between these two microorganisms; (4) identify genes and pathways that underlie these priority effects; (5) train the next generation of plant researcher in essential concepts ecological theory, cell and molecular biology. \r\n\r\nThis award is funded as part of a cooperative program with the UKRI/BBSRC in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
