 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Mid-Career Advancement (MCA) Award will expand knowledge of the evolution and conservation needs of the unique birds of Madagascar. Islands such as Madagascar are often considered natural laboratories to study how species evolved in isolated environments. Given their smaller size, island ecosystems are also highly vulnerable to extinction. This research project will test fundamental theories of how species adapt, diversify, and respond to extinction risks using the biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar, with extraordinary species found nowhere else on the planet. Additionally, the research will develop a new framework for studying the genomic changes that allow the evolution of extreme morphological and functional adaptations to environmental change. For example, some Malagasy bird lineages are considered adaptive radiations because they exhibit dramatic features that likely evolved due to new ecological opportunities. This project will help further our knowledge of the genomic foundations that determine form and function in the evolution of biodiversity. Moreover, this award will support collaboration between diverse researchers of varied career stages and interests, foster partnerships between international institutions, and promote undergraduate and graduate education.\r\n\r\nThis research integrates phylogenetics, biogeography, genomics, and conservation to address two main objectives. First, using an innovative model that incorporates island biogeographic parameters with phylogenetic diversification, this study will investigate the macroevolutionary consequences of extinction risk in the Malagasy avifauna. Madagascar is a unique biogeographic system that combines both island and continental processes; this project will test the broad applicability of diversification models and also inform conservation assessments in this highly threatened biodiversity hotspot. Second, this project will use comparative genomics to integrate genotype-phenotype analyses in adaptive radiations. With a focus on three Malagasy endemic groups, this project will catalyze research into the underlying genomic architecture of ecological and morphological variation to better understand the origins and functions of various traits.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
