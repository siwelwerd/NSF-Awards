Computational network biology, an interdisciplinary field encompassing biology, computer science, and modeling, has witnessed substantial growth in recent years. The Eighth International Workshop on Computational Network Biology: Modeling, Analysis, and Control (CNB-MAC 2023) will take place in Houston, Texas, on September 3, 2023. This award will support conference travel for a minimum of eight graduate students to attend CNB-MAC. By participating in this workshop, students will gain firsthand knowledge of recent advancements in computational network biology, which will have a lasting impact on their research careers. They will also have the opportunity to present and discuss their own research findings, benefiting from valuable feedback and mentorship from established researchers. Furthermore, CNB-MAC will facilitate networking and collaboration among attendees, fostering meaningful connections within the computational network biology community. This travel support award will offer graduate students valuable opportunities to engage with the computational network biology community at CNB-MAC.\r\n\r\nCNB-MAC 2023 will be held alongside ACM's Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics, the flagship conference of the ACM Special Interest Group in Bioinformatics. The workshop aims to provide an international scientific platform for presenting recent advances in computational network biology while emphasizing the importance of rigorous mathematical modeling in transforming large biomedical data into reproducible and meaningful scientific knowledge. CNB-MAC invites original research papers reporting new findings that have not been published elsewhere, highlights abstracts showcasing recent journal publications' advancements, and poster abstracts for rapid dissemination of the latest research results in computational network biology. CNB-MAC workshops serve as an excellent venue for young researchers in computational network biology to share ideas and engage in deep scholarly discussions, ultimately contributing to the field's advancement. This NSF award supporting travel to CNB-MAC for a minimum of eight graduate students will provide essential networking and professional development opportunities for the awardees, significantly alleviating the financial burden associated with conference attendance, particularly for students whose mentors are unable to cover registration and travel expenses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
