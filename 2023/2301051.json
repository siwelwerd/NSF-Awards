 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing a unique collaboration between educators, autism specialists, social service agencies, and the machine technology industry to create vocational opportunities for uniquely abled, Level I Autistic individuals. The project will leverage this dynamic network of experts to prepare students to enter high-demand technical careers as Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machinists, a career pathway in American manufacturing that matches with the unique abilities of most adults with Level I Autism. Eligible students will be supported to enter college, navigate a customized technical education program and transition into a job as a machinist. As a result, the project will increase the number of trained CNC technicians in the North Texas Region and increase the number of Level I Autistic individuals in the technical workforce.  Ultimately, the project intends to fill significant gaps in customized training programs and employment opportunities for the autistic community in the local Dallas-Fort Worth area and serve as a model for the implementation of technical programs at the national level. \r\n\r\nThis project will develop and implement a credit, CNC Mill & Lathe Operator Level I career pathway for uniquely abled, Level I Autistic students. This novel career pathway will focus on the following five critical areas to meet the needs of the target population and build a fast-track path to the workforce: 1) partnership development, 2) student support and resources, 3) curriculum improvements, 4) professional development, and 5) awareness for families, faculty, staff, employers, and community organizations. The project will convene a collaborative of industry partners, vocational rehabilitation providers, local independent school districts, and Dallas College internal stakeholders to establish the foundation for identifying, recruiting, and serving Level I Autistic individuals. In addition, the pathway will integrate a career readiness course to support the development of professional skills and better prepare participants for the workplace. Industry partners will provide experiential learning opportunities, host on-site tours, and provide classroom guest speakers. The Dallas College Student Care Network will provide extensive support and resources to participants such as mental and physical health services, childcare, transportation assistance, and access to food pantries. A learning laboratory will be designated exclusively for participants to ensure skill attainment in an environment that is tailored to their unique needs and growth in the project. Creating a technical career pathway for Level I Autistic individuals will enhance the diversity of the workforce and offer long term careers that provide a living wage. Through dissemination efforts as part of the North Texas Consortium of Community Colleges, this model will be introduced to other colleges and universities especially in the Dallas area and has the potential to be translated to other programs and careers. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
