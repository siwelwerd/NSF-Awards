 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Statistical Science for our Changing Climate workshop series, which will be take place at the American Statistical Association (ASA) headquarters in Alexandria VA November 2023, February, 2024, and April 2024, will focus on moving statistical science forward to meet the challenges faced in the areas of climate and extreme events, climate and the impact on human and animal health, and climate and risk management both for the financial industry and the insurance industry. In the face of our rapidly changing climate, statistics plays a pivotal role in understanding and mitigating its profound impacts. As the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and weather-related events increase, reliable data analysis becomes crucial for identifying patterns, assessing risks, and formulating effective strategies. The complexity of climate systems necessitates the development of new statistical methodologies that can handle intricate datasets, account for uncertainties, and provide accurate predictions. The workshops will focus the statistics communities\u2019 energies on mitigating the multi-faceted impacts of a changing climate on our global structures.\r\n\r\nEach workshop will take place over 2 days and will be organized into 4 modules. The first 3 modules will be focused on the critical statistical content and will begin with an overview talk presented by a previously identified lead investigator. Following the overview presentation, the workshop participants will gather in working groups to address the critical questions and incubate new ideas. The final module for each workshop will serve as a summary wrap-up and be open to external virtual participation. Lead investigators identified for each module will help develop key statistical science questions and take the lead on the authorship of the vision paper as well as research papers planned for each workshop.  In total, it is expected that nine scholarly research papers will be produced, including one overarching vision paper from each workshop. In each case, the vision paper will lay the foundation of what is needed in the discipline of statistical science to support a resilient society with respect to the domain of the workshop. Further, ASA will develop key white papers to communicate to its members and beyond opportunities in curriculum both undergraduate and graduate, as well as corporate collaborations, with an eye toward an ASA corporate fellows program for climate resilience. By combining expertise in statistical modeling, data analysis, and risk assessment with the insights of climate scientists, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics driving climate change and contribute to the development of effective strategies, policies, and solutions that address the challenges posed by climate change on multiple fronts.
