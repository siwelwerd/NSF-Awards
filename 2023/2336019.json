 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a nitrate removal and iron supplement system to improve the growth of plants in aquaponic agriculture system. Aquaponics is the combination of aquaculture and hydroponics into one closed-loop system that recycles water, employs natural fertilizer from aquaculture (fish) waste, and utilizes less space to produce more food year-round compared to conventional agriculture.  Currently, aquaponic systems use synthetic iron chelate and non-biodegradable plant substrates.  Aquaponic systems are commonly deficient in iron, an essential plant nutrient required to synthesize chloroplasts and other essential metabolic processes.  When deficient in iron, aquaponic growers lose profits because plant growth is stunted, and the water is not cleaned fully by the plants for the fish due to inefficient nutrient uptake. The proposed technology integrates with aquaponic systems to enrich plants with essential iron, may be used in both commercial- or home-scale systems, and may provide biodegradable materials to improve aquaponic systems.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of an iron-containing hydrogel for aquaponic agricultural applications. The proposed technology is designed to remove nitrogen and phosphorus from water and acts like a sponge.  The aquaculture industry uses aquaponics to prevent polluting local waterways with excess nitrogenous waste generated during aquaculture production. However, aquaponic growers are required to supplement essential nutrients required by plants that are not supplied from fish waste. Aquaponic systems are deficient in iron, an essential plant nutrient required to synthesize chloroplasts and several other essential metabolic processes. The most common iron supplement is chelated iron (Fe-EDTA, Fe-DTPA, Fe-EDDHA) to allow the iron to dissolve in water. However, iron chelates are synthetic compounds not found in nature, and organic growers want to avoid adding any synthetic chemicals.   The proposed technology is an iron supplement method that employs a material that provides iron to the plant roots.  In addition, the hydrogel is made from recycled by-products from the agriculture industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
