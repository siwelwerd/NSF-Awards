 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop a high-performance cloud operating system (OS), called Octopus OS,\r\nthat can adapt to the dynamic cloud environment. Instead of running on a physical machine,\r\nthe OS now is often running in a virtual machine (VM) in the modern cloud where the resources\r\nare highly dynamic due to resource sharing and VM migration. However, the traditional OS\r\ncannot manage the virtualized resources efficiently due to being unaware of the resource dynamics,\r\nleading to low resource utilization and poor application performance in the cloud. Therefore,\r\nthe proposed Octopus OS would create and manage the accurate abstractions of the dynamic\r\nresources, and develop new algorithms to fully leverage the unique characteristics of the virtualized\r\nresource, which would greatly improve application performance and resource utilization in the\r\ndynamic cloud. This work can advance the cloud OS by serving as a framework for optimizing the\r\nutilization of various virtualized resources. The outcomes will be released for public use. Hands on\r\nprojects will be created during the project development to enrich existing courses related to\r\nOS and cloud computing. This project will involve students from underrepresented groups and promote\r\nresearch in computer systems for all undergraduates.\r\n\r\nFour steps will be taken to achieve the project goal.  First, the mismatches in major virtualized\r\nresource abstractions (i.e., CPU, memory, and cache) will be analyzed in a controlled environment\r\nto understand their impacts, including resultant system abnormal behavior and application\r\nperformance degradation. Second, accurate resource abstractions will be created to fix the identified\r\nmismatches using probing techniques. Specifically, a set of micro-benchmarks, called vProbers,\r\nwill be developed to profile the dynamic nature of the virtualized resources without relying\r\non the hypervisor support or application porting, making this solution practical in the emerging\r\nmulti-cloud environment. The accurate resource abstractions probed within Octopus OS can also\r\nbe leveraged by cloud application and language runtime, and are critical to provide resource visibility\r\nfor cross-cloud optimizations. Third, the new abstractions will be exposed to Octopus OS to\r\nmake it virtualization-aware. New algorithms will be developed to fix existing system abnormal\r\nbehavior and unlock the potential performance benefits of the dynamic resources. Fourth, experiments \r\nwith resource-demanding benchmarks in various public clouds will be conducted to evaluate the ability of \r\nthe proposed Octopus OS to adapt to the dynamic resources in the multi-cloud environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
