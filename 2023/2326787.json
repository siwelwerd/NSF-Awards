 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emergence of new quantum sensors allows for unprecedented levels of sensitivity and exploration of the physical world across various scales. Quantum sensors harness the advantages of quantum coherence and entanglement. By leveraging non-local correlations distributed among multiple particles, networks of quantum sensors can enhance sensitivity and reveal the spatial structure of target signals at both microscopic and macroscopic scales. This project aims to develop a protocol to showcase the capabilities of quantum sensor networks. It involves understanding fundamental properties, conducting proof-of-principle experiments, and adapting approaches to different platforms and scales for diverse scientific applications. The project will focus on theoretical concepts to describe and enhance spatially distributed quantum sensing, utilizing cutting-edge quantum networking technology on multiple platforms: diamond   defect-based nanoscale magnetic-resonance imaging to sense on the molecular scale; entangled networks of atomic clocks to sense gravitational effects; and quantum enhanced THz antenna networks to sense on astronomical scales. \r\n\r\nTo achieve high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, small clusters of paramagnetic spins associated with NV centers will be utilized for entanglement-enhanced magnetometry and optimal control. This approach enables nano-scale resolution imaging of magnetic fields in materials and biological systems. This project involves developing an entangled network of clocks, combining entanglement-based time-reversal quantum metrology with atom transport while maintaining entanglement. These capabilities will be utilized for sensing gravity gradients, searching for dark matter, and exploring physics beyond the standard model. Additionally, a quantum enhanced THz antenna will utilize collective response of Rydberg atom arrays to electric fields across a broad frequency range (10GHz - few THz). By optically connecting THz receivers and conducting a feasibility study, this team aims to establish global-scale quantum receiver arrays, potentially enabling the detection of faint stellar objects beyond current technology. The experimental work will be complemented by novel theoretical methods that incorporate recent advancements in quantum information and machine learning, including measurement-prepared quantum many-body states, optimal control, and machine learning-optimized controls. This interdisciplinary project combines state-of-the-art technologies in quantum information, atomic-molecular-optical physics, and machine learning, with wide-ranging impact across disciplines such as astrophysics, particle physics, biology, and chemistry.  This project was co-funded by the Quantum Sensors Challenge for Transformative Advances in Quantum Systems (QuSeC-TAQS) program, the Special Projects program in the Division of Astronomical Sciences, the Electronic and Photonic Materials program in the Division of Materials Research, and with co-funding from the Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
