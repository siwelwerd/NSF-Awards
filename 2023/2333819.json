 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to link the Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine (SPOKE) knowledge graph with NASA\u2019s GeneLab platform and incorporate social determinants of health (SDOH) data into SPOKE. SPOKE includes 35 million nodes and 70 million edges gathered from 43 databases and structured on 11 ontologies. SPOKE will expand to include the fields of space biology and medicine, facilitating a two-way translation of knowledge and the identification of valuable analogues to support the advancement of human multiplanetary colonization. SPOKE's integration with GeneLab and SDOH data provides comprehensive analysis of extensive datasets, offering researchers unparalleled access to multispecies biological information. This approach allows identification of common patterns, exploration of new gene-drug interactions, and study of space-related stress effects on gene expression and molecular pathways. It will advance our understanding of space biology and enrich genetics and genomics research more broadly.\r\n\r\nThe integration of GeneLab experimental data involves creating a computational model to understand challenges astronauts face in space. This involves using GeneLab's omics data and SPOKE's ability to connect data across space and time to develop effective countermeasures. The project also involves understanding and addressing SDOH in managing medical conditions. By analyzing de-identified Electronic Health Record data, researchers can design interventions to promote crew well-being during long space travel and develop equitable healthcare systems for space missions. The project will enhance our understanding of health inequalities, promote diversity, equity, and inclusion within the scientific community, and provide educational opportunities, encouraging STEM careers. The project will also emphasize ethical considerations and privacy protection, while promoting collaboration and accelerating scientific progress for a larger societal impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
