 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the instructional, research, and development capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal by strengthening the STEM cyberinfrastructure for instructional and research activities. The project aims to enhance cyberinfrastructure and cybersecurity necessary to facilitate development of the institution in STEM fields and for the protection of sensitive data. \r\n\r\nThe project seeks to upgrade specific STEM IT resources at the institution to improve the resiliency and security of STEM operations, data management, teaching, and research enterprises. Improvements to ANC\u2019s network and cybersecurity seeks to advance the college\u2019s ability to implement advances in STEM instruction and research. The activities for developing STEM cyberinfrastructure will directly support current and future projects. Students will benefit from increased access to online resources and virtual courses. STEM research activities in environmental science and natural resources will be aided and enabled by advances in cyberinfrastructure at the institution.  Due to the inclusion of the library in the upgrade, the community served by the college will also benefit.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
