 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a novel mechanical system which improves the safety of the elderly and disabled while walking on level surfaces and stairs. The novel, wall-mounted system will reduce the risks of injury by mechanically supporting individuals during ambulation, rehabilitation, and eventual in-home gait assistance. The system aims to reduce one of the top reasons for emergency room (ER) visits (nearly 3,000 ER visits in the United States each year) by preventing falls in the home.  The solution may also be used in medical facilities to safely ambulate convalescent or acute care patients, especially on stairs. In addition to reducing direct patient injury risks, the technology improves economic and productivity measures by reducing the number of therapists/nurses, relatives, and support workers caring for people with disabilities or those at risk of falls.\r\n \r\nThis STTR Phase I project will demonstrate a novel, mechanical, wall-mounted gait assist that can safely reduce injuries and the risks of falling while walking across flat surfaces and stairs. A harness with an elastic-like tether, mobile trolley, and mechanical braking mechanism for maintaining patient safety will be completed. The individual is connected to a trolley travelling along a wall-side rail providing the variable forces needed to support a patient\u2019s weight in order to minimize risks of injury. In the event of a fall, the trolley\u2019s brake automatically activates, absorbing the shock with a vest/tether to prevent the user from falling to the floor. Following design engineering and prototype completion, a pilot proof of concept study will be conducted during Phase I to demonstrate the potential for patient use in safely walking without falling and causing injury.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
