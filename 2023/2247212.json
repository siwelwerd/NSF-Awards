 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of graduate students, early-career researchers, and members of groups underrepresented in statistics in the International Chinese Statistical Association (ICSA) 2023 Applied Statistics Symposium, with the theme \u201cStatistical Learning and Reasoning from Data to Knowledge\u201d, held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, from June 11 \u2013 June 14, 2023. The event serves as the 32nd official annual meeting of ICSA. The main objective of the conference is to bring together both well-established and junior researchers, as well as students, from around the world who are actively pursuing theoretical and methodological research in statistics, biostatistics, data sciences and their applications in various allied fields. It provides the broader statistical community with a great opportunity to network and exchange ideas of recent developments in statistical theory, methodology, and applications.\r\n \r\nThe format of the conference includes multiple plenary talks, invited sessions, student paper competitions, contributed posters and short courses. The organizers strive to enhance diversity of speakers and maintain a healthy inclusive atmosphere. In addition, a special panel discussion will be organized on mentoring and career development, especially geared toward women and researchers from groups underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). For students, the conference will provide opportunities such as a student paper competition and contributed poster sessions. The website with details about the symposium is symposium2023.icsa.org\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
