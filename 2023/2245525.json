 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethylene is a plant hormone that plays a vital role in regulating important agronomic traits such as fruit ripening, senescence, disease resistance, and stress responses. Autophagy, on the other hand, is a cellular process in which cells recycle and break down their own components to obtain energy and building blocks, particularly during stressful conditions. The objective of this project is to investigate the interaction of these two important cellular pathways and understand their molecular and physiological consequences during normal plant development and under stress. By gaining a deeper understanding of how plant hormones, like ethylene, interact with autophagy, we can optimize crop performance in diverse agricultural settings. The research project offers valuable research training opportunities for postdoctoral scientists, graduate students, and undergraduate students. Additionally, the project includes outreach activities targeting the general public, with a focus on local high school students through internships and established summer research programs. These activities involve engaging students in hands-on laboratory exercises and research presentations, providing them with direct and immersive experiences in the field of plant biology research.\r\n  \r\nPlant hormones and autophagy play crucial roles in regulating plant adaptation to their environment by modulating growth, physiology, or cellular energy levels. However, the integration of these pathways in plant biology remains poorly understood despite extensive research on their individual regulatory mechanisms. This research project aims to bridge this knowledge gap by investigating how autophagy regulates ethylene biosynthesis and the signaling role of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) in autophagy. The first objective is to uncover the mechanisms by which autophagy regulates ethylene biosynthesis, focusing on autophagy-mediated ACS protein stability regulation and the functional implications of ethylene-autophagy crosstalk. Initial findings suggest the existence of crosstalk between these pathways. The second objective is to genetically investigate the role of ACC as a signaling molecule in autophagy and ACS protein turnover. Using interdisciplinary approaches spanning genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and physiology, this project aims to elucidate the functional and structural connections between ethylene and autophagy. Ultimately, these investigations will provide new insights into the interplay between plant hormones and autophagy, as well as shed light on the previously unknown functions of ACC in plant biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
