As near-peer participants in the CEU, they will enhance the experience of the undergraduate students through individual and group meetings, physics discussions, and psychosocial support. In addition, the funding will enable participants to attend the conference and present their own research, discuss their work with members of the community, and further their own careers.  Institutionalizing a trained near-peer network at the DNP will continue to aid undergraduate students in developing a scientific identity that is essential for them to see themselves as future physicists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
