 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops new point-process based algorithms for modeling and forecasting event-level infectious disease data, such as when an epidemic is emerging, near elimination, or for contact tracing. The methods developed through the project have applications to source detection of super-spreader events, identification of case importation trends, and providing better risk assessments of emerging epidemics and future pandemics. The methods developed through the project also have applications beyond epidemiology where point processes are used, including social media, seismology, and criminology.  The project will train two PhD students in statistics and computer science. This project will support one graduate student per year at each university for each of the three years of the grant. \r\n\r\nThis project develops new point-process based algorithms for solving four important tasks that arise in modeling infectious disease threats over a range of temporal and spatial scales: 1) incorporating realistic transmission and reporting mechanisms, 2) link prediction in the transmission graph connecting separate geographic regions under surveillance, 3) source detection of the spatial-temporal and network locations of super-spreader events, and 4) modeling emerging disease epidemics over timescales of decades and spatial scales of the globe.  Expectation maximization algorithms are derived to infer a probabilistic branching structure that can be used for contact tracing and source detection. Multivariate Hawkes processes are formulated to infer cross-transmission across separate geographic regions, where new theory and methods are needed to handle reproduction above the critical threshold of 1.  Point process analogs to compartmental models are developed through the project that can incorporate realistic transmission and under-reporting mechanisms (e.g. exposure period, asymptomatic cases) to improve forecasts and prevalence estimation. Finally, this project develops models of emerging epidemic events for determining the separability of disease parameters vs. space and time and assessing the risk that an outbreak will become a pandemic.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n \n\n\nIn this project we investigated point process based algorithms for several tasks associated with infectious disease modeling, including source detection, estimation of disease transmission, and forecasting surges. We developed several new ways of estimating parameters of point processes defined on networks, for incorporating spatial covariates into point process models of disease transmission, big data methods of fitting point processes, and methods for point process model assessment.\n\n\nIn terms of intellectual merit, the methods developed through the project allow for accurately fitting cross-productivities in multivariate Hawkes processes, overcoming bias in traditional maximum likelihood estimates when a disease is surging at the same time in multiple locations. Point process algorithms were developed that can integrate heterogeneous, big data including county level demographic features, spatial-temporal human mobility data, and large event datasets with hundreds of thousands of events or more. We developed new methods for assessing the fit of point process models, especially magnitude-weighted measures that properly reward a model for more accurately forecasting key features of primary interest. The project resulted in 18 journal and conference publications.\n\n\nIn terms of broader impacts, we showed that Hawkes process models for the spread of Covid-19 in the United States have competitive accuracy in comparison to the most widely used forecasting models, with approximately 30% smaller forecasting errors, on average, compared to compartmental models like SEIR. Our methods are useful when it is possible for people from one location to move and infect people in another location, and our methods can be used to estimate the frequency and impact of these infections. We found that, if one were to use a Hawkes model to forecast whether or not a surge in cases is likely to occur in the next two weeks, the model achieves an accuracy of 88%, which is considerably higher than alternative methods. We also developed models to estimate secondary impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on violence in major U.S. cities. The project included the training of 3 PhD students and 1 postdoctoral fellow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/17/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: GeorgeOMohler\n"
