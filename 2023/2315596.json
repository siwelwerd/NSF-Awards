 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by establishing an interdisciplinary mixed reality (XR) Engineering curriculum that prepares undergraduate students for flourishing careers as XR professionals and researchers. The rapidly evolving field of XR technology presents U.S. higher education institutions with a unique combination of opportunities and challenges, as the higher education institutions endeavor to tap into the potential of the XR domain. This project intends to advance XR engineering education and foster workforce development, with crafted learning materials and activities empowering students to create XR applications across diverse industries, tackle societal challenges, and unlock innovative opportunities. The project will employ evidence-based pedagogical approaches, such as learning-by-doing and learning-by-teaching, while integrating recent advances in XR technology. \r\n\r\nThe proposed curriculum is designed with adaptability in mind, enabling its implementation as a new STEM program, minor, or certificate, thereby expanding participation and bolstering institutional capacity for STEM workforce development. The curriculum will initially be launched as a pilot program at Kennesaw State University and Georgia State University, two minority serving institutions. The study will be conducted using both quantitative and qualitative research methods, encompassing a review of existing literature, surveys, expert interviews, and focus group discussions with undergraduate students.  Anticipated outcomes encompass a comprehensive XR engineering curriculum, enriched learning materials, and engaging activities that boost student engagement and retention while promoting increased STEM participation among women and minority students. The project results will be disseminated to other institutions, particularly Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the local area to further strengthen the XR education ecosystem and broaden the impacts of the proposed work.  The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
