 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) programs. Franklin and Marshall College is acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with a broadband probe to support the research of Professor Edward Fenlon along with colleagues Sarah Tasker, and Davide Lionetti. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of physical organic chemistry, structural biology, and materials science.  In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. Using the intrinsic magnetic properties of atomic nuclei, it is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students, including undergraduates from underrepresented groups, at all levels in the Chemistry Department as well as provides accessibility for use at a nearby community college, Harrisburg Area Community College.\r\n\r\nThe award of the 400 MHz NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as synthetic and mechanistic organic, biophysics, and biochemistry. Specifically, the instrument enables research focusing on the development of new radicals for dynamic nuclear polarization measurements and studying vibrational coupling to measure internuclear distances in DNA, RNA, and proteins. Other investigations include developing the reactivity of s-aryl thioformate reagents and the synthesis and biological evaluation of antibacterial natural products and their derivatives.  Additional research projects to be enabled by the 400 MHz NMR spectrometer include facilitating multielectron reactivity with bidentate ligands, enabling cooperative reactivity in multimetallic complexes, and tailoring nanoparticles via post-synthetic transformations. In response to global helium supply challenges, the acquisition of this instrument includes a superconducting magnet with a low loss cryostat reducing the institution\u2019s consumption of helium.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
