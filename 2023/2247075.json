 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ocean science is important for the public to understand as the impact of water as a resource has become more significant in recent years. As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative resources for use in a variety of settings including rural communities. This project's goals are to educate rural communities and youth about ocean science via setting up exhibits in unique venues such as parks, parking lots and at community gatherings as well as in local libraries. Local library staff and Girl Scouts will assist the investigators in operationalizing the community activities. The project is a collaboration between the Consortium for Leadership, Inc., Rutgers University, the University of Hawaii, Ashland University, the College of Exploration, the Girl Scout organization and some of its affiliates, the Rural Library Education Network, local museums, and the Texas State Aquarium.\r\n\r\nThis project will experiment with a new style of presentation called \"Pop up\" which brings in exhibits that are rapidly and easily set up in unconventional venues such as parks to get the communities' attention. From among the visitors attending the \"Pop up\" sessions, the organizers will invite those who have shown interest to attend deeper discussions of ocean science at the local library.  This deeper discussion, referred to as \"Drill down\", will involve scientists commenting from a research ship on their research activities. Cores from the ocean floor will be used to educate attendees about the history of the planet. Locations of the project venues will include rural communities that have a high population of underserved citizens. Research questions to be investigated are: 1. Do the \"Pop up\" and \"Drill down\" exercises create an effective and sustainable model for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) learning? 2. How does the \"Pop up/Drill down\" methodology meet the needs of partner informal science education institutions such as the libraries and Girl Scouts in fulfilling their own missions? 3. What is the impact of these sessions on increasing awareness and knowledge of ocean and earth science, technology, and the work of scientists/engineers?",

However, unlike many of NASA?s missions, the adventures and achievements made by the deep sea exploration vessel, the <em>JOIDES Resolution </em>(<em>JR</em>), have largely flown under the radar for those not directly involved in its science. This is especially true for those from underserved populations. <em>In Search of Earth's Secrets</em> partnered with scientists, small museums, libraries, youth organizations, and local community groups to bring a traveling exhibit focused on the discoveries of the <em>JR to</em> 12 locations across the nation over the past 6 years. The local partner organizations were chosen as they serve a large proportion of underserved minorities in STEM and/or rural populations. Supplemented with previously developed outreach resources and networks, this traveling exhibit consisted of a giant inflatable replica of the <em>JR</em>, 6 interactive exhibit kiosks, a giant floor map, and oversized stackable core puzzles. In addition, to empower local youth to act as docents for the exhibit, at each location, training events were held focused on the exhibit along with deep sea research and careers.</p>\n<p>Through <em>In Search of Earth?s Secrets</em>, several outcomes were achieved: 1) enhancing community awareness of science and engineering, especially among youth, 2) fostering new partnerships, 3) increasing capacity for local venues to provide science resources, and 4) helping institutions/organizations meet their individual missions. Annual trainings and team-building for site coordinators and partners, along with regular meetings, helped to form a larger community of scientists and informal education partners. Similarly, the creation of new local partnerships through this work has opened the door for a series of new collaborations around STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) topics. Implementation at sites without participation from institutions of higher education demonstrated that, given access to resources (i.e. Zoom with the ship/scientists and online materials), these types of traveling science exhibits can be effective without an academic institution as the lead. Overall, this project provided a replicable and sustainable model for STEM learning in informal environments. Beyond this project, the exhibit and the supporting materials created through this grant, will continue to make an impact on communities as it is sent around the country by its new permanent hosts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/28/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sharon&nbsp;K&nbsp;Cooper</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2247075/2247075_10399787_1686940632404_rutgersdayship--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2247075/2247075_10399787_1686940632404_rutgersdayship--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Entering the JOIDES Resolution\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2247075/2247075_10399787_1686940632404_rutgersdayship--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Entering the JOIDES Resolution\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Attendees and patrons were provided the experience to walk through a giant inflatable ship.
