 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project managed by the Chemistry Division at NSF, Professor Zacharias Kinney and his students at Oakland University will perform studies that aim to develop new organic macrocycles and metallomacrocycles to serve as photoactive materials with unique optoelectronic properties. As society continues to search for efficient and sustainable energy solutions a growing area of interest are primarily low-cost organic materials that display unique photophysical properties. The Kinney lab\u2019s efforts are focused on synthesizing molecules that are emissive and can serve as the core photoactive component in optoelectronic materials such as solar cells and organic light-emitting diodes. To accomplish this task the Kinney lab employs multiple types of interactions \u2013 namely covalent, non-covalent, and metal-ligand bonding \u2013 to assemble macrocyclic structures containing multiple thiophene-based monomers. Ultimately, their studies aim to improve our understanding of structure-property relationships in photoactive materials containing macrocyclic components while elucidating their potential applications as sustainable materials. Central to this program will be broadening participation in STEM by providing an equitable opportunity for Oakland Community College (OCC) students to gain an authentic research experience while pursuing their associates degree.\r\n\r\nProfessor Kinney and his research team will investigate and elucidate the structure-property relationships of isomeric naphthodithiophenes for use in optoelectronic devices. By employing angular naphthodithiophene building blocks predictable discrete, shape-persistent macrocycles and metallomacrocycles can be synthesized under facile conditions. These macrocyclic products afford extended pi-conjugation, allowing for unique photophysical properties. Researchers will be tasked with synthesizing and characterizing these molecules in both the solution- and solid-state. The macrocyclic nature of these molecules yields an interior cavity lined with heteroatoms, providing additional opportunities for post-synthetic modulation of the molecules photophysical properties through host-guest interactions. A section of this work will be completed by OCC students through the advent of a paid research internship during the summer; wherein students are able to participate in an authentic research experience in a synthetic chemistry laboratory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
