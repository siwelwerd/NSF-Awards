The ACM SIGSPATIAL conference is the world's premier Spatial Information and Geographic Information Systems research conference. The conference brings together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners conducting research and development in novel systems based on geospatial data and knowledge. The conference promotes interdisciplinary discussions and research in broad disciplines and applications, including computer science, geography, urban planning, land use, and defense. The conference also seeks to foster the development of a new generation of researchers and practitioners in the critical area of Spatial Information and Geographic Information Systems.\r\n\r\nThe ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems 2022 is the 30th event in a series of symposia and workshops that began in 1993. The ACM SIGSPATIAL conference has established itself as the world's premier Spatial Information and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) research conference. The conference provides a forum for original research contributions covering all conceptual, design, and implementation aspects of GIS, ranging from applications, user interfaces, and visualization to storage management and indexing issues. The conference brings together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners conducting research and development in novel systems based on geospatial data and knowledge. The ACM SIGSPATIAL conference will feature research presentations, workshops, demonstrations, poster sessions, and student-focused activities, including a student research competition, a spatial computing competition, and mentoring by senior researchers. Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems will be available in the ACM Digital Library.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The NSF funds allowed us to support 20 Ph.D. students and 1 postdoctoral researcher. All awardees attended the conference and were called and recognized during the banquet. The SIGSPATIAL Cup was offered for the 11th time in 2022 and was, as usual, very popular with students. The ACM Student Research Competition was held for the 11th time, which allowed undergraduate and graduate students to share their research results and exchange ideas with other students, judges, and conference attendees, understand the practical applications of their research, perfect their communication skills, and receive prizes and gain recognition from ACM and the greater computing community. ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS 2022 also hosted its first female networking event with 28 female researchers. Most of the attendees at the networking event were current Ph.D. students in spatial science or computer science, with one postdoctoral researcher, one master's student, and two high school students. The discussions among the event attendees revolved around various topics, including building a career, managing time as a mother and Ph.D. student, and effectively navigating challenging situations as minorities. The event was widely enjoyed and appreciated by all attendees.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/31/2023<br>\nModified by: Yao-Yi&nbsp;Chiang</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
