 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Tribal College and University Cyberinfrastructure Community of Practice workshop provides an opportunity for the IT Directors, CIOs, and other administrators, IT staff or faculty at TCUs, who are geographically isolated across the United States, to meet in person, exchange best practices, interact with invited national cyberinfrastructure (CI) experts, and collaborate across TCU CI initiatives, academic areas, and/or geographical regions.  The workshop is organized by the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) and led by a program committee consisting of AIHEC, TCU and external experts. Cyberinfrastructure topic areas expected to be addressed through both presentations and in-depth panel discussions include CI Strategic Planning and Academic Engagement, Cybersecurity and Technology, TCU Future Directions and CI Funding Strategies. Workshop panelist and presenters come from the TCUs\u2019 IT staff and faculty but also include external subject matter expects and research and education community members. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the workshop includes the opportunity for TCU staff knowledge and skill development focused on new and existing cyberinfrastructure technologies in support of science and engineering applications relevant to the tribal community.  Given the important role the TCUs play in their communities, implementation of capacity-building relationships with TCUs will enable them to serve a similar function to their area K-12 schools and Tribal agencies, advancing them through the adoption of the shared CI tools and resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The goal of the workshop was to serve as a platform to share important successes as well as a vehicle to continue to discuss and troubleshoot existing CI concerns in the TCU community.

Based on the recent exemplary efforts in cyberinfrastructure development in the Tribal College community, the workshop spanned two and a half days with two subject tracks.

Subtopics included identifying and pursuing funding opportunities for CI, the benefit of TCU collaboration with national CI organizations such as the Minority Serving Cyberinfrastructure Consortium (MS-CC), Research and Education Networks (RENs), and Internet2 and Educause, and developing, formalizing, and socializing new CI policies on the campuses. The second track focused on faculty and student CI engagement at TCUs, including Computer Information Science (CIS) and cybersecurity curriculum development, CI resources for campus instruction and research, Federated Identity, and student hackathons. Each day of the workshop included campus lightning talks organized by the TCU IT Directors to share their current network and academic challenges and opportunities. The workshop resulted in a list of outcomes and action items for the AIHEC CI Team and the TCU CI community providing focus for the next year of CI Facilitation activities.
