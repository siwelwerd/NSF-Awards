 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by expanding K-12 quantum education research into the elementary grades, investigating how elementary teachers and students learn quantum science concepts. As quantum technologies emerge, the resulting changes in numerous STEM fields will lead to an increasing need for quantum workforce development. Quantum education research at the K-12 level has been limited and has largely focused on high school students and teachers, yet most students have decided if STEM is for them long before high school. Elementary students are still developing their interests and beliefs about who they can become. To diversify the future quantum workforce in this fast-changing field, students must be introduced to quantum in the elementary grades. This two-year project will engage 10 elementary teachers and over 400 elementary students in quantum learning experiences, with an increasing impact in the years following the project.\r\n\r\nThis project will study learning associated with elementary teachers' engagement in professional learning and elementary students' learning related to quantum science, quantum thinking, and careers. The knowledge base required for elementary teachers and students to learn quantum will be identified in order to explore and compare how elementary students and teachers conceptualize and make sense of quantum science concepts. The project will also examine how elementary teachers adapt, develop, and implement quantum curricular materials for use in their classrooms. This study will serve as a first effort to understand how teachers develop their knowledge and conceptualization of quantum ideas and pedagogy for the elementary classroom. By opening the door to research on quantum education at the elementary level, this project will create opportunities for diverse learners to engage and get excited about this upcoming area of future opportunities. The goals of this project are to (a) engage elementary teachers in quantum learning experiences, and (b) develop elementary quantum curricular materials. This project is co-funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 (DRK-12) program, which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
