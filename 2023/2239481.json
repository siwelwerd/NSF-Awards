 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arizona State University will investigate a key lever in K-12 computer science (CS) pathways - - the position of the CS education state supervisor (CSEdSS) housed at state education agencies (SEA). Since 2016, K-12 computer science (CS) education policy work has accelerated through various intermediary organizations, state legislatures, governors, and national organizations. Despite the tremendous work around expanding K-12 CS education policy, equity issues persist in terms of access and opportunity to learn CS. There is a need to understand structural barriers to diversity in computing with a view to the entire ecosystem, from pre-K through the workforce. State education agencies (SEAs) are instrumental in ensuring that equitable access to K-12 CS learning pathways is enacted \u2013 often  through a combination of teacher training, resource development, teacher certification pathways, community outreach, and administrator support. This CAREER project will study CSEdSS and  ensure diverse, inclusive, and accessible CS educational pathways across schools and districts within states by informing the development of research-based resources and tools to support CSEdSS as they enact their roles.\r\n\r\nThis project uses a critical lens to examine how the national policy of creating a state CSEdSS position at SEAs is enacted. Surveys, interviews, observations, focus groups, and documents will be used to explore how CSEdSS operationalize and enact their roles to ensure diverse, inclusive, equitable, and accessible CS educational pathways within their states. The specific aims of this study build on one another: 1) conduct a landscape study of K-12 CSEdSS that will inform selection of four states 2) conduct a comparative case study of CSEdSS in four states to illuminate the mediators, drivers, and outputs of CSEdSS; and 3) develop a toolkit and set of resources to support the CSEdSS community of practice with a view to equity. This project contributes to how research, policy, and practice can work together to advance equity and excellence for all students in terms of access, experience, and outcomes by (a) advancing a critical and systemic approach to assessing the implementation of CS education policies; (b) framing CS education policy research while considering the national landscape and variance in local context; (c) operationalizing CSEdSS\u2019 role with inclusive and equitable CS education pathways; and (d) developing a system of support for CSEdSS nationally. This work lies at the intersection of policy, practice, and research, to investigate the root causes of systemic inequities while working in partnership with non-profit organizations, state departments of education and policymakers to illuminate and advance solutions to dismantle structures that perpetuate inequity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
