 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plastics have transformed and broadly benefited modern society; however, with a cumulative global production exceeding 9 billion metric tons, the generation and management of plastic and plastic waste are fundamentally intertwined with environmental pollution and climate change. Mismanaged plastic lifecycles irrecoverably commit non-renewable resources to either pyrolysis processes or to landfills, which generates substantial greenhouse gas emissions and produces microplastic pollution. These consequences exacerbate global climate change, putting both environmental ecosystems and human health at risk, with coastal and underserved communities, as well as individuals with vulnerable health conditions, bearing a disproportionate burden. This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaborations award will enable researchers from institutions in two EPSCoR jurisdictions (MS and AL), including the University of Southern Mississippi (USM) and Auburn University (AU), to establish a transdisciplinary program to address plastic waste challenges and their climate and health impacts, while building community climate resilience and advancing social and environmental justice in Mississippi and Alabama. In partnership with regional research and health institutions, local communities, small businesses, and recycling service providers, the project team will assess the impact of microplastics on marine, aquaculture, and community health, develop blend compatibilizers to improve mixed polyolefin recycling, and create next-generation bio-sourced polymers. The project features a comprehensive workforce development and training plan that focuses on enhancing the skills and competencies of researchers, students, and industry professionals with a particular focus on advancing STEM diversity and inclusivity. Program elements include mentorship and advancement for early-career researchers, virtual professional development workshops, student-led symposia to foster networking and leadership skills, summer research programs for undergraduates, and specialized training sessions for workers in construction, agriculture, and marine sectors to better manage plastic waste. A robust outreach program will foster community engagement through setting up research exhibits along the coast, leading hands-on expeditions for plastic debris removal from beaches, and enhancing recycling infrastructure in underserved areas. These plans are strategically designed to promote sustainable practices and knowledge transfer for long-term impact on participating jurisdictions. Collectively, the project will serve as a regional hub for plastic-climate-health research, advancing economic development, environmental and social equity, and workforce diversity.\r\n\r\nThe transdisciplinary Advancing Social and Environmental Equity through Plastics Research: Education, Innovation, and Inclusion (ASPIRE) project seeks to mitigate the negative impacts of plastic pollution on vulnerable coastal communities in AL and MS, leveraging innovative and inclusive research, education, and outreach. ASPIRE will foster social and environmental equity through a holistic approach, integrating the fields of polymer science, chemistry, (bio)engineering, social/health science, and marine ecology. Specifically, project teams at the USM and AU will: 1) develop advanced detection methods to analyze microplastic contamination in field and aquaculture samples, pairing these findings with community health and behavior surveys to identify microplastic-to-human exposure pathways; 2) synthesize blend compatibilizers containing dynamic crosslinkers to enhance mixed polyolefin recycling, extending the lifespan and improving the performance of recycled products for sustained use; and 3) design inherently recyclable polymer thermosets comprised of dynamic crosslinks using sustainable, bio-derived building blocks, concurrently establishing fundamental chemistry-structure-property relationships. Technology development within these projects will be informed by technoeconomic and life cycle analysis to ensure maximized sustainability and economic feasibility. ASPIRE aims to foster a diverse workforce by actively recruiting underrepresented groups, nurturing early career researchers through comprehensive mentoring programs and seed grant opportunities, and partaking in outreach activities aimed at K-12 students. The program will engage coastal community stakeholders, providing targeted training to local small businesses and focusing on effective plastic waste management. Coastal communities in the Gulf of Mexico region, people with vulnerable health conditions, and racial and ethnic groups from underrepresented populations bear the brunt of plastic pollution and associated climate change. ASPIRE strives to enhance opportunities and elevate the quality of life for these historically marginalized populations in Mississippi and Alabama.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
