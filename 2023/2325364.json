 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a high-performance, drone-based, wildlife telemetry technology that is economical and easy to use. Its improved performance and significantly lower cost than existing competitive technologies will empower users with greater capability and lower the barrier to entry for field data collection. This technology will enable researchers to better understand the complex effects of geography, climate, interspecies competition, invasive species, and land use policy on animals and their habitats. \t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThis project will enable a co-robotic system that employs an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an assistant wildlife tracker. By fusing data from the UAV and the knowledge and insights of the human tracker, the team will greatly increase the capability of these systems to track a larger number of animals, to increase the frequency of tracking campaigns, and to improve the ease of use. This research will develop and refine a new class of machine learning algorithms for wildlife localization. As the UAV platform executes its mission, the human tracker can monitor its progress and plans, and intervene at any time with commands to re-direct the UAV. The research plan tackles the key challenges in this problem domain, including safety of UAV operation and the possible effects of noise emissions. Based on the identification of key risks and mitigation strategies, the research plan executes multiple rapid iterations of a develop-simulate-deploy-test design process within a set of tasks that tackle increasingly complex localization scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
