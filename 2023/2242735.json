 "awd_abstract_narration": "STEM-Trek, a Nonprofit organization, has facilitated events prior to the annual Supercomputing Conference since 2015. In collaboration with Dan Stanzione (Director, Texas Advanced Computing Center and National Science Foundation\u2019s (NSF) Ranger project), the first workshop was for high-performance computing (HPC) systems administrators at TACC prior to SC15 in Austin, Texas. The second: \u201cHPC On Common Ground@SC16,\u201d focused on food security science in collaboration with principal investigators from the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State. URISC@SC17 (Understanding Risk in Shared Cyberecosystems) was led by NSF Trusted-CI Director Von Welch (Indiana University). In 2018-20, the organization held smaller events that took on a more multidisciplinary scope \u2013 attendees either support or are actively engaged with basic research \u2013 many with industrial partners - in a wide range of domains. The organizers plan to return to the pre-conference format for EarthSci@SC22 in Dallas Texas, Nov. 13-18 which facilitates meaningful relationships before delegates enter the main event which, due to its size (>10k), can be overwhelming. The event will broaden participation to include demographics that are underrepresented in research computing and data science careers and academics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
