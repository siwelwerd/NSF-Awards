 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past five years, Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) has emerged as a national priority with the passage of the 2018 National Quantum Initiative Act and the 2023 CHIPS and Science Act, both of which call for significant investments in QISE research, industrial innovation, education, and workforce development. Quantum systems and their unique behaviors will lead to significant improvements in computing, communication, and sensing, but the technologies cannot advance without skilled and knowledgeable people. To support QISE education, it is critical to understand the jobs within the QISE industry and their associated requisite skills and knowledge. Because of the rapid expansion of the industry, existing workforce data is already out of date. There is a need for more current, detailed, and comprehensive quantum workforce analysis, and a need to disseminate this knowledge to current and future QISE educators and program developers. Similar to the QISE industry, higher education has seen a rapid growth in courses and programs related to QISE. However, prior research indicates these opportunities tend to occur in research universities and are less prevalent in other institutions. The community needs a more comprehensive picture of the QISE education landscape to identify what is being taught, where it is being taught, and which students are benefitting from existing QISE courses and programs. Developing a clearer understanding of the quantum workforce will make the path into QISE more transparent for students from diverse backgrounds and diverse institution types, such as Minority Serving Institutions, two-year colleges, and regional four-year colleges. An understanding of which populations have less access to QISE education may also guide future investments into new QIS courses and programs.\r\n\r\nThis project consists of three major activities: (1) a study characterizing the QISE workforce through an analysis of the knowledge, skills, and abilities for QISE jobs, (2) disseminating workforce data to improve QISE education, and (3) a large-scale study characterizing QISE education across the United States. Activity one (1) will use semi-structured interviews with approximately 40 employees in the quantum industry discussing the occupations, typical tasks, and the skills, knowledge, abilities, and education background required to carry out those tasks. The interviews will align with the O*NET Content Model to describe the QISE specific features that are particular to engineers, software developers, technicians, and scientists working in the QISE industry. The detailed information is critical for developing learning goals and curricula that reflect the most broadly applicable and important QISE knowledge and skills. Activity two (2) is focused on disseminating workforce findings to instructors. To maximize the impact of the data, QISE instructors and program directors will be interviewed to discuss their views on the QISE workforce and what insights would be most helpful for guiding their course development. Additionally, the team will present seminars through multiple QISE conferences to disseminate findings. Activity three (3) is a comprehensive examination of QISE instruction in higher education within the United States. The data will include the geographic distribution, institution types, levels of instruction, and number of students and majors being impacted. Through follow-up surveys with QISE instructors, the team will also develop a more fine-grained analysis of the QISE topics being covered, pedagogical approaches, industrial connections, efforts at broadening participation, and challenges faced by instructors. The hope is to reduce barriers to developing QISE educational opportunities, particularly for institutions who serve diverse populations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
