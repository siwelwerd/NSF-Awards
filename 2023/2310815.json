 "awd_abstract_narration": "A considerable proportion of agricultural food production is lost to insect and nematode pests. In addition, some insects transmit disease to plants or to humans. The development of new pest management approaches is critical for the sustainable production of sufficient food for the increasing human population, and for prevention of arthropod-transmitted disease to plants and humans. The expansion of pest distribution resulting from changes in climatic conditions and the development of resistance to current control agents, both present significant ongoing challenges. The Center for Arthropod Management Technologies (CAMTech) addresses issues to facilitate effective management of the major insect and nematode pests that impact agriculture and human health. The center addresses the need for specific knowledge through state-of-the-art research and provides research tools to expedite delivery of pest management solutions. Industry partners can utilize these research data and tools to develop new pest control strategies for the marketplace and to extend the utility of current management approaches. \r\n\r\nAs a Phase III Industry University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC), CAMTech will continue to serve as a platform for innovative, interdisciplinary research activities at the interface of academia, government, and industry. The center conducts pre-competitive research of crucial importance to the industrial sector using advanced methods ranging from lab-based 3D cell culture, genome editing and single-cell RNA sequencing, to field-based aerial imagery of pest damage.  Research focus areas are: \u2018omics, physiology, resistance, integrated pest management (IPM) and tools. The center promotes diversity and trains personnel for potential future employment within the industrial sector. Research expertise at the University of Florida includes insect physiology and toxicology, microbiology, integrated pest management and agricultural nematology. University of Florida participants work with a diverse agriculture and a wide range of pests of urban and public health importance, resulting from the large number of invasive species combined with a sub-tropical climate favored by pest populations. The research needs of industries in the agricultural biotechnology and human health domains are aligned with the expertise of university participants providing for the expedited development of pest management solutions to the benefit of agricultural sustainability and to public wellbeing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
