 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry, Stefan Paula of Sacramento State University is studying the development of small molecules capable of stimulating the activity of an enzyme whose natural function is the transport of calcium ions across cell membranes; namely the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). Use of the novel small molecules to modulate the activity of the SERCA enzyme would allow the investigator to observe the effects of altered calcium concentrations inside the cell. The new molecules are designed to enhance enzyme activity and as such would complement a class of molecules known to reduce SERCA activity.  The research will involve the training of students in a variety of techniques frequently employed in biomolecular chemistry research. As part of the project, molecular modeling techniques and the synthesis of specific compounds will be incorporated in three upper division courses at Sacramento State University.\r\n\r\nIntracellular calcium levels are tightly controlled by the action of calcium transporters such as SERCA because they are critical regulators of many cellular processes. The major goal of this project is the development of small molecules that modulate the activity of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). Specifically, the Paula research group is aiming to establish the first tools for chemical biology that unregulate the activity of SERCA to study of the effects of increased or decreased intracellular calcium levels in living organisms. Whereas the use of SERCA inhibitors as research tools is well-established, activators have thus far received very little attention. Using a synergistic combination of computational and experimental approaches, the project seeks to close this gap by generating novel SERCA activators, establishing the molecular determinants for SERCA activation at the molecular level, and evaluating the new compounds in vivo. Organic synthesis of potential SERCA activators, activity assays with purified SERCA, molecular modeling, and cell-based assays are to be used to accomplish these research goals. The planned study appears to be the first systematic exploration of SERCA activators and is expected to provide valuable knowledge in SERCA-ligand structure-activity relationship space and potentially very valuable tools for chemical biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
