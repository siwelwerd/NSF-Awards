 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent catastrophic events in the coastal tropics and sub-tropics highlight the impact of the interdependencies of critical infrastructure systems and how those interdependencies cause failures of physical assets, leading to adverse impacts on the health and socio-economic wellbeing of the communities in those regions. Islanded communities, defined as remote, self-contained regions, with low or intermittent physical (or cyber) connectivity, are especially vulnerable to natural disasters. A recent example is the extraordinary case of the island of Puerto Rico (PR), in the direct path of Hurricane Maria, and the near total failure of lifeline infrastructures. This event also exemplifies how extreme events compound endemic physical, social and economic vulnerabilities often present in remote or isolated communities. The associated cascading impacts, prior to and after Hurricane Maria, are clear evidence of our limited knowledge and readiness to anticipate risks in these complex engineered, physical and human systems. This reveals the urgent need to develop scientific and social frameworks and methodologies by which islanded communities can assess their existing preparedness to extreme climatic events, and through a multi-stakeholder engagement process and engineering analysis, evaluate and implement alternative measures to enhance the resiliency of such communities. Using PR as the case study, this Critical Resilient Interdependent Infrastructure Systems and Processes (CRISP) project will develop a data-driven modeling framework for understanding the complex physical and social vulnerabilities, and interdependencies that can and have resulted in near total failure of infrastructure systems.\r\n\r\nThe research questions that will be addressed include: a) How do socio-economic stability, governance and baseline conditions of  infrastructure impact performance and resiliency of critical interdependent infrastructure systems in extreme weather conditions? b) What knowledge and methods are needed to guide strategies for enhancing system resiliency and restoration in islanded communities? c) How can experts and stakeholders be engaged and informed about enhancing resiliency and effective failure mitigation strategies? The plan to achieve these objectives is by first implementing a data-driven process of gathering human narratives as social data and a source of information to recreate the timeline and experience of Hurricane Maria, before, during and after the event. Next, the project team will develop an integrated modeling and simulation framework, based on multi-layer distribution network theory. This framework will include structural-based assessment results in the modeling of infrastructure behavior during and after a disaster. The focus of study will be on the interdependencies of the electrical power, water distribution and communications systems. An objective is to recreate, via simulation, the event using a combination of system network models, geophysical data, and community data, to capture the sequence of the cascading failures and the corresponding societal impact as the event unfolded and during post-event recovery efforts. The project team seeks to arrive at a level of understanding of this system of systems that will lead to informed solutions and recommendations that will minimize adverse impact, disruption, loss of life and suffering, in the face of future extreme events. The research builds on a wealth of expertise in weather and climate processes in the Caribbean, understanding of local critical infrastructure, experience in mining community narrative, and from proven methodologies for rebuilding resilient communities in post-Hurricane Sandy in the New York and New Jersey Metro Area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This has been a collaborative project between University at Albany (UAlbany), New York University (NYU), Arizona State University (ASU), and the University of Puerto Rico-Mayagez (UPRM). A summary of the outcomes are summarized here. \r\n\n\nThe main objectives of the effort were;\r\n\n\nObjective-1: Work with infrastructure experts, stakeholders and community members to document the sequence of events during and post passage of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in September 2017 for reconstruction of physical data and social accounting of the local impacts.\r\n\n\nObjective-2: Develop a structured-based (social and human-centric) assessment approach for identification of descriptive characteristics of human and engineered systems.\r\n\n\nObjective-3: Develop an integrated socio-technical, performance based network model of the interaction of the physical, social, and cyber systems when faced with natural extreme events.

These collective efforts accomplished the following Outcomes:\r\n\n\nHuman Domain: We documented the forms of social capital and adaptive capacity the emerged in Puerto Rico during and after Hurricane Maria in 2017, explored how quantifiable and physical variables manifest in community experiences, and illustrated how quantitative and qualitative approaches for resilience assessments can be integrated given the nature of disasters of place as complex adaptive systems.

A series of signifiers for resilience capacities were developed that were self-coded by participants (i.e., micro-narratives), and a series of geospatial indicators were developed to layer and aggregate against ethnographic information.

These findings are important to inform and integrate community-oriented and technocentric solutions toward resilience enhancing measures, especially in islanded communities like Puerto Rico.\r\n\n\nGeophysical Domain: A comprehensive collection of geophysical data available related to conditions prior, during and after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico including; hydro-meteorological, atmospheric, and river stream records was recorded. A comprehensive sequence of events was assembled based on these records. An atmospheric hurricane model was configured and validated using the above data that has served to fill the gaps of the geophysical processes related to the passage of Hurricane Maria, and the data has been made publicly available for wider use (Figure-1).\r\n\n\nConstructed Environment Domain: \r\n\n\n(Loss of Service). We adopted a multilevel modeling approach based on spatial aggregation to model recovery with satellite-based nighttime lights and utility crew deployments. At the municipal level, we identified the association between service crew deployments and nighttime lights. We found the effect of service crew deployment varies spatially. At the county-subdivision level, we used nighttime lights as a surrogate for the restoration of transmission and distribution power lines. According to the model parameters, emergency facilities, like hospitals and financial institutions such as pharmaceuticals, hotels, and offices experienced quicker recovery, whereas limited accessibility due to higher elevation adversely influenced the restoration efforts. We further advanced a damage assessment effort for the electrical power grid and an associated modeling development of damage due to weather using artificial intelligence techniques (AI) and satellite-based nightlight data as proxy for power infrastructure damage (Figure 2).\r\n\n\n(Interconnected Infrastructure). The effort integrated the power and water infrastructure to quantify interconnections and hardening options for these interconnections with focus on continuous service during extreme weather events and impacts on vulnerable communities due to loss of combined power-water services. This socio-technical integrated infrastructure modeling was tested in Western Puerto Rico (Figure-3).\r\n\n\n(Hardening of the Transmission System). A full accounting of the power damage to the power transmission system was conducted revealing that the majority of the damage occurred in single and two pole structures, which has the potential to be replaced by metal self-support structures as scalable hardening option under conditions similar to H-Maria. The improvement of replacing such structures has been quantified, by using AI techniques trained using utility inventories and WRF simulated weather data (Figure 4).\r\n\n\nHuman Resource Development: The project involved and trained a considerable large number of doctoral (6), master (5), and undergraduate students (5). \t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/08/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JorgeEGonzalez\n"
