 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU) will undertake an institutional self-assessment to identify potential organizational inequities (unjust or unfair) policies and practices that result in differential professional outcomes for some STEM faculty. The ADVANCE Catalyst project will result in a five-year STEM faculty equity plan tailored to the FGCU context and institutional data that will guide institutional actions to address any issues identified during the grant. FGCU is a relatively new institution compared to other ADVANCE institutions having been established in 1997.\r\n\r\nThe institutional self-assessment and five-year strategic plan will set a foundation to improve equity for STEM faculty at the institution. This work will benefit STEM disciplines as well as non-STEM disciplines due to the interconnected nature of institutional policy. Results of the Catalyst project will be regularly communicated with the FGCU community and involves an advisory board of key upper administrators. The project outcomes will be shared with the ADVANCE community and others through a website, presentations, and peer-reviewed publications.\r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions. Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate. ADVANCE \"Catalyst\" awards provide support for institutional assessments and the development of five-year faculty equity strategic plans at an academic, non-profit, institution of higher education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
