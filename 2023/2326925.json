 "awd_abstract_narration": "The provided support will enable about 15 US-based students to attend and participate in the 49th International Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB 2023) to be held in Vancouver, Canada from Aug 28 to Sep. 1, 2023 (https://vldb.org/2023/). The VLDB conferences are a premier international technical event centered on various aspects of database research and practice. The VLDB conference provides a forum that promotes students and researchers to identify scientific foundations for building large-scale database management systems that can work ever more effectively. Efforts will be made to broaden the participation of underrepresented students and researchers. The conference will thus contribute directly to training the next generation of scientists who are both consumers and developers of technology in database management system design and implementation. The involvement of US-based students will have a direct impact in creating a highly-qualified workforce who can take on the emerging data science challenges of the future.\r\n\r\nDatabase research profoundly influences domains that include machine learning and AI, health sciences, Internet of Things (IoT), service-oriented computing, real-time business analytics, social computing, etc. The VLDB conference series provides researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government agencies with an excellent opportunity to share their research and experiences on all aspects of data management and analysis at scale. The aims of the conference are multi-fold: (1) to provide an international forum for sharing research results related to the investigation of major challenges in next-generation database research; (2) to stimulate interactive discussions on research in the database area through panels, posters, tutorials, student scholar roundtables, etc.; and (3) to motivate and engage future generations of researchers via the many conference and workshop presentations, interactive poster sessions, and panel and breakout sessions. The VLDB 2020 Proceedings are will be broadly accessible at The Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment (http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
