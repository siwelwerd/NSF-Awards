More recent efforts in contextual integrity include operationalizing contextual integrity and what it means, discovering contextual norms for privacy, capturing users\u2019 privacy expectations in varied contexts, as well to analyze regulations and using contextual integrity to establish research ethics guidelines. Given the diverse interests, perspectives and challenges, it is important to bring this diverse community of researchers using contextual integrity together to discuss what has been learned from the projects using contextual integrity theory and how to move forward to leverage contextual integrity for enhancing privacy preserving systems and policies. \r\n\r\nThis is the fifth iteration of the Annual Symposium of Applications of Contextual Integrity that assembles computer scientists, engineers, legal scholars, social scientists and ethicists to foster communication between the various communities of researchers and practitioners using the theory of contextual integrity as a framework to reason about privacy and use it as a common language for sharing of ideas. The Symposium develops new collaborative interdisciplinary research partnerships around the theory of contextual integrity with existing communities in industry, academia, and government, and establishes a body of significant literature for future work on privacy enhancing systems. It also facilitates interdisciplinary connections amongst privacy researchers in social science, law, computer science, ethics, and policy to produce more reliable and readily adopted privacy-enhancing technologies. The Symposium broadens participation in computing by providing travel grant awards and in-person mentoring opportunities to a diverse set of students primarily from under-represented and marginalized populations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
