 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meta-analysis is a more recent research technique that allows the researcher to bring together and analyze multiple, smaller studies in a valid and reliable manner. This enables researchers to increase reliability of the conclusions and recommendations on a research topic.  The results of a meta-analysis depend upon the quality of the data gathered about the studies, the effective selection and use among the various techniques and procedures, as well as the attention to potential limitations in the data. In addition, since effective data gathering is the core of a useful meta-analysis, it is important to have an organized and effective research team. This suggests that effective planning and research team development are critical components in preparing to conduct a meta-analytic research project. This project proposes to engage in a strategic process of research team-building and in-depth planning for the future submission of a proposal to support a meta-analytic review of the SCCT literature that focuses on previously unexamined aspects of the theory and its use in the field. \r\n\r\nThis planning project will involve working with the Advisory Board in their capacity as experts in various aspects of conducting meta-analyses to ensure that 1) this research team develops the synergy necessary to successfully propose the project, and 2) the PI develops advanced skills in leading this type of research/team and builds institutional capacity/commitment for this type of project. The project will utilize standard strategic planning processes, consultation, and collaborative efforts to ensure a high-quality proposal to be submitted by the close of the planning grant period. The intellectual merit of this project rests in its reliance on experts with significant training and experience in using meta-analytic techniques to ground proposal revision efforts. The broader impact of this project rests in the future outcomes of a successful proposal submission, that is based on a more thorough understanding of the SCCT theory that will move theory development forward.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
