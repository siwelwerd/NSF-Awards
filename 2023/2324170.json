 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2023 and 2024 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), sponsored by the IEEE Communication Society, are to be held in Rome, Italy between May 28 and June 1, 2023, and in Denver, CO on June 9-13, 2024, respectively. IEEE ICC is a premier international conference of the IEEE Communications Society and a major event in wireless communications and networking that brings researchers and practitioners of every aspect of digital/wireless communications and networks together to present up-to-date results and achievements in the field. It is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field. Participation in events like this is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading-edge work in the field. Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of other leading-edge researchers in the field.\r\n\r\nThis proposal provides travel support for approximately twenty-six graduate students in the United States to attend this premiere conference either in 2023 or in 2024. The travel awards will target first-time attendees and under-represented minority students, since attending conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds. The research community and the Engineering workforce benefit from the improvement of students in the pipeline, and the introduction of new researcher perspectives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
