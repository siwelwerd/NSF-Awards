 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to treat pediatric patients affected with Ewing\u2019s Sarcoma by targeting the root cause of the disease. Using a novel approach, new therapeutics will be developed to specifically inhibit the protein that causes Ewing\u2019s Sarcoma and thereby extend the lifespan of patient. The approach will enable understanding of the molecular underpinnings of this devastating disease. Importantly, findings from this study may be able to treat diseases driven by similar proteins, providing new medication for patients with few available treatment options.  The successful outcome of the project would lead to the commercialization of the first-in-class\r\ninhibitor to target the oncogenic fusion protein, EWS-FLI1, to treat Ewing\u2019s Sarcoma. In addition, the technology could provide valuable data about drugging oncogenic proteins in other disesases such as prostate cancer and breast cancer.\r\n\r\nThis project will aid in characterizing potential therapies for Ewing\u2019s Sarcoma. The goals include: (1) determining the toxicity profile of novel inhibitors across a panel of human cells, (2) measuring the drug specificity to the target protein, and (3) determining the efficacy of the lead molecule in mice. The data from this study will add to the understanding of drugging fusion proteins which are validated drivers of many diseases such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, and Ewing\u2019s Sarcoma.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
