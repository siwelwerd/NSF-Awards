 "awd_abstract_narration": "Why do we remember some things, but forget others? New memories are fragile, and have to be strengthened and reorganized in order to last. It is known that memories are strengthened at the end of the day during sleep. However, the early stages of this process of memory strengthening, called \u201cconsolidation\u201d, might happen very quickly, during seconds-long periods when we zone out, relax and rest during our daily lives. This project investigates precisely how these waking zone-out periods are able to improve memory. \r\n\r\nWhen we sleep after learning, new memories are repeatedly reactivated in the brain, incrementally strengthening memory traces over time. The research in this project tests whether this same process of memory reactivation and strengthening explains how short zone-out periods are able to improve memory during wakefulness. It is possible to measure this process by using EEG (electroencephalography), a non-invasive brain imaging technique, combined with measures of pupil size, thought and behavior. The project has two main goals: first, the project investigates whether memories are reactivated and strengthened during seconds-long periods of waking rest, in a similar way in which they are reactivated and consolidated during sleep. Second, the research in this project explores how memory consolidation during waking rest works together synergistically with sleep to improve memory. This project aims to test the working hypothesis that rest and sleep act in sequence, with sleep being required to fully consolidate and strengthen an initial memory boost that happens during wakefulness. This research hopes to deepen our understanding of memory and ways to enhance it. Beyond its scientific goals, this project also strengthens science and STEM training by providing high-impact research training for high school students and undergraduates, including members of underrepresented minority groups. \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Cognitive Neuroscience Program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
