 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings undergraduate students and high school teachers together to solve contemporary research problems in mathematics. Working together in small groups over an extended period during the summer, the participants will enhance their abilities in problem solving, communication, and intellectual perseverance as they learn the working methods of a research mathematician. The primary goal of the project is to produce publications in peer-reviewed academic journals based on the culmination of successful research. Additionally, by introducing participants to successful research processes, they will be well-prepared for future success in mathematical disciplines in graduate school and beyond. The combined cohort of undergraduates and teachers will bolster the mathematical fluency and dynamism of local secondary mathematics education, leading to enhanced educational opportunities for future high school students.\r\n \r\nThis award supports a multi-year Research Experiences for Undergraduates and Teachers (REUT) program at California State University, Chico (CSU Chico). During each of the three years funded by the grant, two faculty members will mentor a group of ten participants as they work on mathematical research problems over a seven week period during the summer. The participants are mostly advanced undergraduate students in mathematics from throughout the U.S.A., joined by high school mathematics teachers recruited from the region served by CSU Chico in northern California. The research topics are drawn from the expertise of the faculty advisors and consist of compelling contemporary problems in number theory, graph theory, commutative algebra, topology, and statistics. By engaging the students with guided research techniques during the summer session, and then maintaining regular contact in the following months, the advisors will help facilitate successful academic publications as a result of the REUT.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
