 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a new domestic commercial source of enriched lithium isotopes.  The U.S. nuclear power industry requires enriched lithium-7 hydroxide to prevent corrosion in its present fleet of pressurized water reactors.  Currently, this strategic material is supplied outside the U.S. and recent supply disruptions jeopardize 20% of the U.S. electrical generation capability. Longer term, the development of safer, lower-impact, new technologies for nuclear power generation is critical to meet the U.S. and global goals of reducing carbon emissions. One of the most promising technologies, molten salt reactors, will require commercial production of large quantities of enriched lithium-7. Even longer term, many of the fusion energy technologies in development will require enriched lithium-6. The planned production of lithium isotopes will enable the development and commercialization of safer, lower-impact nuclear energy.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project proposes the implementation of a liquid/liquid extraction method for lithium enrichment in a pilot-scale production system.  To date, this type of extraction has not been employed for commercial lithium isotope enrichment. The Phase II work will result in the design of the first commercial-scale production process. The innovative approach to lithium isotope enrichment will also have applicability in the purification of other stable isotopes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
