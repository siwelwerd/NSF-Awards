 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular infrastructure at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal. \r\n\r\nThe necessity of basic laboratory equipment is almost as great a priority as the necessity of compelling STEM instruction and research. Bay Mills Community College is increasing its equipment holdings with laboratory equipment commonly found in STEM instruction.  Autoclaves, in particular, are so commonly used in post-secondary STEM instruction and research that their lack can be considered a profound disadvantage to students who may pursue higher-division coursework at another college or university. Additionally, access to such equipment can have a disproportionately positive impact on the view students have of scientific inquiry and career options.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
