 "awd_abstract_narration": "Founded in 1941, the Society for Applied Anthropology promotes the investigation of the principles of human behavior and the application of these principles to contemporary issues and problems. The Society has over 2,000 members and sponsors two major journals. The Society provides a critical professional space for anthropologists focused on basic scientific questions with use-inspired research objectives, as well as the development of innovative new methodologies in anthropological science. This project broadens the participation of groups historically underrepresented in science. In keeping with the 2024 annual meeting\u2019s thematic focus on transformation, the project also includes clear dissemination plans for the communication of science to the public. Opportunities are afforded through this project to train graduate and undergraduate students and early career professionals in scientific methods.\r\n\r\nThis project convenes scholars working in areas of use-inspired anthropological science at the 2024 Annual Meetings of the Society for Applied Anthropology in Sante Fe, New Mexico. The project supports funding for travel and accommodations for students, scholars, practitioners, and community members who belong to one or more of the following groups: (1) historically underrepresented in anthropological sciences and/or (2) disproportionately affected by critical issues in the 2024 Annual Meeting program (which includes issues related to environmental variability, water scarcity, and disaster risk and preparedness). In addition to instituting anthropological applications of the science of broadening participation to optimize the quality of anthropological science, project outcomes advance anthropological science in a range of specific subfields, including environmental change and water scarcity, culture and medicine, disaster preparedness, disability studies, and Indigenous knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
