 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum algorithms have the potential to revolutionize how currently intractable problems are solved, however more research is required to realize their full potential. The goal of this Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site is to encourage student participation in cutting-edge, interdisciplinary quantum computing research that focuses on solving large-scale optimization problems. Optimization problems are the focus of this research as they have real-world applications, such as packaging routing and scheduling. Undergraduates who participate in this REU site will gain critical research experience by developing code that implements quantum algorithms, mathematically proving bounds on algorithm performance, and comparing leading quantum algorithms to the best classical algorithms. Furthermore, the students will participate in professional development opportunities that are designed to encourage them to consider their career plans.\r\n\r\nThe proposed REU site will host ten students for ten weeks each summer. Participants will perform quantum algorithms research as applied to solve realistic, large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. Students will learn fundamental quantum algorithms research techniques such as how to run quantum algorithms on hardware, use machine learning and statistical methods to analyze data generated by the experiments, and provide theoretical or computational performance bounds.  The goals of the program are to broaden student participation in interdisciplinary quantum computing research, develop the next generation quantum computing workforce, and develop participants\u2019 research and scientific writing skills. The projects for this REU site will be designed so that the students\u2019 research will become more independent as the summer progresses. Pre- and post- program surveys will be administered and the results will be used to refine the REU site each year.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
