 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Postdoctoral Research Fellowship project, the PI will use remote sensing observations along with laboratory and field measurements to determine if peatland fires, and the associated nitrogen emissions, might fertilize nearby high-latitude soils resulting in an enhancement of microbial production of nitrogen oxides. These northern high-latitude soils are the largest reservoir of soil organic matter on the planet, and ongoing disruptions due to wildfire and other climatic changes could result in a substantial release of greenhouse gases and reactive gases such as nitrogen oxides, which are the focus of this work. The new knowledge gained during this project could enhance our understanding of an understudied and potentially substantial source of soil nitrogen emissions, which will be beneficial to atmospheric chemistry and climate research communities, as well as the broader public.\r\n\r\nThe specific tasks include: (1) using satellite remote sensing data to document trends and emissions of nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide from high-latitude fires and soils; (2) conduct laboratory soil chamber experiments to quantify in-situ emissions from burning peatland soils; (3) deploy a network of nitrogen oxides analyzers to compare ambient nitrogen oxides concentrations nearby both burned and pristine soils; (4) combine these data with forward modeling in order to compare to satellite columns; and (5) conduct additional laboratory experiments to determine physical and chemical controls of soil nitrogen oxides. The end result will provide emission factors of nitrogen oxides from fires and soils in high-latitude land masses and will provide information that might explain the nitrogen oxides anomaly observed after peatland fires. The PI plans on joining and enhancing the Polar Science Early Career Community Office and mentoring an undergraduate student during the course of this project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
