 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for junior scientists to attend the 25th International Spin Symposium (SPIN 2023).  The symposium is held every two years and alternates between the U.S., Europe, and Asia.  It traditionally brings theorists and experimentalists together to discuss instrumentation and theory in spin phenomena of particle and nuclear physics. The symposium format consists of talks in plenary and parallel sessions, with a poster session.  The symposium is organized in the following topics:\r\n\u2022\tNucleon Helicity Structure \r\n\u2022\tTransverse momentum dependent structure (TMD) \r\n\u2022\tForm factors and Generalized Parton Densities (GPDs) \r\n\u2022\tFuture facilities and experiments  \r\n\u2022\tFundamental Symmetries and Spin Physics Beyond the Standard Model  \r\n\u2022\tAcceleration, Storage, and Polarimetry of polarized Beams  \r\n\u2022\tPolarized Sources and Targets  \r\n\u2022\tSpin in Nuclear Reactions and Nuclei  \r\n\u2022\tApplications of Nuclear Polarization in other Fields  \r\n\u2022\tLow energy spin physics with lepton, photon, and hadron probes\r\n\r\nThe symposium will be held September 24 \u2013 29, 2023 at Duke University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
