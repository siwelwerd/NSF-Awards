This international conference series is primarily aimed at graduate students and early career researchers working in geometric group theory and related areas of mathematics. The aim of the conference is to expose these researchers to new topics, to provide them with an opportunity to present their work, and to facilitate collaborations. The meeting includes mini-courses by established experts, plenary talks by selected early career researchers, informal discussion sessions, lightning talks by participants, a poster session, and two panels. The mini-courses are on topics at the forefront of research in geometric group theory. The panels will focus on professional development as well as on equity, diversity, and inclusion.\r\n\r\nThe mini-courses in this conferences are Big Mapping Class Groups by Federica Fanoni, Cannon-Thurston Maps by Mahan Mj, Soficity by Andreas Thom, and Incoherence and Quasiconvexity by Genevieve Walsh. These lectures will present a panoramic overview of some of the important developments in their field. The plenary presentations will aim to focus on other recent research and directions to broaden the scope of the workshop, and to encourage the participants to explore the boundaries of the subject. More information about the conference can be found on the conference website: https://www.uni-muenster.de/GGT/YGGT/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
