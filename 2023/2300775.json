 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by increasing pathways into its geospatial technology (GST) associate of applied science (A.A.S.) and for-credit certificate programs at Harford Community College (HCC). As GST is woven into government and industry applications, employers in the Mid-Atlantic and beyond increasingly need a workforce with the technical skills to create, develop, use, and analyze mapping and surveying technologies and products. Within GST, there has also been a call for research to better understand how to equip educators, build relevant curricula, and engage future GST learners. As one- and two-year GST training programs structured for nontraditional students can effectively move workers from entry-level, low-wage jobs into well-paying careers the project\u2019s significance includes supporting students\u2019 career advancement and financial security. Through the Map Your Success project\u2019s diverse connections to schools, public and private employers, and communities where workforce development is needed, HCC expects to demonstrate the high value and relevance of GST careers. The project aligns with NSF\u2019s mission and draws on Advanced Technological Education (ATE) scholarship, including the work of the ATE-supported GeoTech Center, to advance understanding of how GST programs integrate traditional STEM skills with social and behavioral sciences. The project will support the GST program to train in the competencies employers seek and can effectively open a new pipeline into GST jobs for community college students.\r\n\r\nHCC\u2019s goals are to increase GST A.A.S. enrollment from 9 students to 20 students per year and enroll an annual average of 20 GST certificate students by the end of the project period. Project objectives are to (1) enhance the GST A.A.S. and certificate programs to align with workforce needs; (2) enroll an average of 20 GST A.A.S. students and 20 GST certificate students annually, reaching approximately 100 students over the three-year ATE project period, by engaging secondary educators, high school students, and current HCC students in GST outreach and education opportunities; and (3) retain and graduate an average of 80% of students in each program and support their advancement into relevant technical careers. HCC will learn from and partner with the GeoTech Center and the Maryland Geographic Alliance at Towson University to develop statewide professional training opportunities for secondary educators; create a new Unmanned Aerial Vehicles course; expand the existing GST Advisory Board; strengthen GST internships; hold annual International GIS Day events; and reach out to local high schools and underserved communities. Through Map Your Success project evaluation, HCC will investigate, generate new knowledge about, and disseminate findings on the pathways into GST careers from diverse entry points, as well as the benefits of effective partnerships in training the next generation of technically skilled mapping and GIS technicians. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation\u2019s economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
