 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will advance our understanding of the role supermassive black holes play in the formation and evolution of galaxies. This will be achieved through a comprehensive study of the regions surrounding supermassive black holes in a large sample of nearby galaxies with actively growing black holes. The observations will measure the distribution and motions of the molecular, ionized, and coronal gas, as well as that of the stars, within vicinity of the central black hole. This sample of galaxies will support a robust investigation of the inflow of materials feeding the black hole growth and the influence this activity has on the rest of the galaxy. The research will include substantial involvement by at least six undergraduate students and will provide them an authentic research experience working with state-of-the-art data in an educational experience that will prepare them for advancement to graduate school or workforce placement. A particular focus will be placed on recruiting undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups. The general public and youth groups will also be engaged during planetarium shows, multiweek courses held for an Anchorage lifelong learners program, and through hands-on activities to be offered during established campus public events. \r\n\r\nWhile it is acknowledged that supermassive black holes play a fundamental role in the evolution of galaxies, the nature of the relationship between these black holes and their host galaxies has yet to be established. Theoretical models attempt to reproduce the observed black hole-host galaxy correlations, but due to a lack of observational constraints these models must make broad assumptions about the physical processes responsible. Only local active galactic nuclei (AGN) offer adequate spatial resolution to investigate the circumnuclear regions relevant to the time scales of the AGN lifetime. The distribution and kinematics of the molecular, ionized, and coronal gas, as well as that of the stars will be measured within the relevant central region (central 500pc) in a sample of 90 bona fide AGN with adaptive optics near-infrared integral-field spectroscopic data available from Keck/OSIRIS and VLT/SINFONI.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
