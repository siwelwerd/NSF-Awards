 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support an Engineering Mechanics Education Workshop to be held in conjunction with the 2023 Engineering Mechanics Institute Conference at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, 6-9 June 2023. Engineering mechanics education is now at a crossroad, facing the challenge to train an inclusive workforce equipped with modern tools to address 21st century engineering needs in comparison with continuing with the business-as-usual practice. To address this urgent matter, this workshop brings engineering mechanics education experts and enthusiasts from R1 and R2 universities to discuss the future pathways to train and engage the next generation of engineering mechanics students. This workshop will serve as a forum to discuss the very definition of applied mechanics in the broader engineering curriculum and highlights potential pathways to reshape the boundaries of engineering mechanics in view of climate change and emerging data science technologies. The award will facilitate the workshop and conference participation of PhD students and postdocs with an emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion of underserved and underrepresented groups in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe workshop consists of four modules including guest lectures, technology demonstration, virtual, and in-person round table discussions and brainstorming sessions. Module I will discuss the future of engineering mechanics education. Module II highlights the significance and best practices of leveraging pedagogical tools in engineering mechanics education. Module III presents emerging education technologies and accessibility issues surrounding the broader dissemination of engineering mechanics educational materials. Starting with shared experience and best practices, Module III culminates with the design of the engineering mechanics textbook of the future and the use of virtual reality to close the accessibility gap. This tour of modern pedagogy in engineering mechanics education will conclude in Module IV with a roundtable that will elucidate career opportunities. A key feature of the workshop is that it will be linked with the 2023 Engineering Mechanics Institute Conference, which will provide opportunities for the engineering mechanics educators to network and discuss their teaching practices with peers from academia, national laboratories, and industry, while also ensuring that workshop discussions and feedback will be directly relevant and accessible to participants from the community of engineering mechanics and civil infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
