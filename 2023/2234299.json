 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geometric group theory is active area at the interface of geometry, algebra, and dynamical systems, which has seen many break-through results over the past decades, with many applications especially to low-dimensional topology. This award provides funding for the first Riverside Workshop on Geometric Group Theory, which is to be held March 27-31 2023 at the University of California Riverside.  This workshop will feature four minicourses given by early-career mathematicians working in the field.  The topic of each minicourse will be a cutting-edge technique or idea developed by the speaker, with an audience of graduate students and postdocs in mind.  Each speaker will also produce an expository paper on the topic of their minicourse, and these papers will be compiled into a book.\r\n\r\nMuch of the machinery in geometric group theory is highly technical, and so graduate students looking to enter the field will benefit from careful exposition of the big ideas of the field in lecture series that elaborate extensively on background and examples.  The invited minicourse speakers are: Matthew Durham (University of California, Riverside), who will speak on the hierarchical geometry of mapping class groups and surface bundles; Anne Lonjou (Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay), who will speak on applications of geometric group theory to algebraic geometry; Marissa Kawehi Loving (University of Wisconsin-Madison), who will speak on the geometry of mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces and their mapping tori; and Jean-Pierre Mutanguha (Institute for Advanced Study), who will speak on the geometry of mapping tori of free group automorphisms.  For more information, please see the conference website: https://sites.google.com/view/riggthew-2023/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
