 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Middle Tennessee State University is acquiring a fluorescence spectrometer to support the research of Professor Justin Miller and colleagues Andrienne Friedli, Scott Handy, Piotr Kaszynski, and Paul Van Patten. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of biophysical, materials and organic chemistry. Fluorescence spectroscopy reveals information about molecular structure after light is absorbed and emitted by a sample. The emitted light exhibits relative intensities as a function of wavelength, which are subsequently related to the various vibrational energy levels in a sample. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award for a fluorescence spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as studying enzymatic polymer hydrolases for deactivation of water pollutants and photovoltaic mechanisms in quantum dot materials. In addition, evaluation of photonic materials such as boron cluster derivatives are investigated. It also assists with the analysis of organic small molecules that can serve as tunable fluorescent sensors, probes, and labels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
