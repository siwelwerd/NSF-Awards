 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research vision is to create a breakthrough in the capability of future semiconductor technologies - to develop devices, circuits, systems, process, design flow and tools, and train students, in a novel platform for electronic-photonic systems-on-chip (EPSoCs) in advanced CMOS foundry processes, addressing a range of key applications in computing, communication and sensing. Semiconductor technology is entering a new age as the transistor scaling that has provided the past 50 years of progress slows down. Electronic-photonic (EP) integration offers a path to revolutionizing these capabilities via powerful new systems-on-chip (SoCs) for applications from optical input/output (I/O) today, through future radio frequency/mm-wave signal processing for 5G/6G wireless, light detection and ranging (lidar) imaging, and new paradigms for computing like artificial intelligence (AI) scale-out fabrics, photonics-interfaced superconducting electronics, and quantum computing. This path of innovation requires a convergent, interdisciplinary co-design approach intertwining the skills of photonics designers, electronic circuit/system designers, process engineers, and system/application experts. Researchers plan to utilize initial proof-of-concept developments to team with the domain and application experts and establish a base research and educational portfolio and a research team to shape the Center-scale Co-Design research effort.\r\n\r\nMonolithic electronics-photonics integration has been demonstrated by the members of the team - its use and advantage in classical optical interconnects, as well as the design of the first photon-pair source with integrated electronic sensing and control, molecular and ultrasound eletronic-photonic sensor systems-on-chip, a design of the mm-wave analog photonic link and a demonstration of the first cryo-photonic link. The goal in this work is to establish an effective co-design team with application domain experts to further develop the architectures and system-to-device modeling methodologies and co-design efforts along the three key research vectors in computation, communication and sensing, to establish a research and educational foundation for future Center-scale Co-Design research effort. Furthermore, these EPSoC concepts will be developed in a new, photonics-optimized high-volume electronic-photonic process (45nm SPCLO SOI CMOS) enabled by the team\u2019s previous work. In the long-term, this work will create an EPSoCs platform that leverages state-of-the-art CMOS foundry technology. It will develop a framework (block libraries, tools, models and design methodologies) for low cost, rapid innovation and design of sophisticated EPSoCs. It will also democratize EPSoC technology making it accessible to a broader research, industrial and even educational community (e.g. making possible EPSoC chip design through open-source design tools and generator libraries).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
