 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide indoor farmers with data insights to reduce risks and improve efficient use of resources to grow nutrient dense food. The value proposition is a first-to-market, off-the-shelf smart water quality and atmospheric conditions monitoring platform to support controlled environment agriculture, currently a $4.6 billion market. The proposed on premise smart service will focus on precision agriculture controls and advance state of the art in agriculture technology using a modular approach to enable plugging in multiple sensors into a unified system to capture water and air quality data at routine intervals around the clock. The temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen measurements will be used to identify healthy conditions, display trend analyses, predict and diagnose imbalances, and provide alerts, alarms, and message notifications to guide coordination of efforts to regain system balance. The target markets are the fast-growing U.S. aquaponics and hydroponics industries. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves development of an Internet of Things (IoT) platform service to overcome legacy issues slowing the digital transformation in indoor agriculture.  Existing solutions do not provide an open platform approach addressing the handling of open data due to proprietary application interfaces and closed data schemas to fuse disparate dataset sources. The measured data will be fused (i.e., overlaid and triangulated) to monitor relationships between measured parameters.  The scope of the project is to develop key features in preparation for field testing. The scientific approach will leverage inherently heterogenous and complex edge technologies. Data connectivity with third party vendor modular sensor arrays, microcontrollers, microservices, and actuators rely on many different operational technology communication standards \u2014 the proposal will overcome these challenges with hardware and software solutions that will integrate microservices within a container to enable application portability and simplify application deployment and orchestration. A standard open framework will be used to facilitate interoperable software applications and value add services utilizing industry standard protocols and message structure interfaces.  This solution will enable third party module integration to connect into a unified, contained, store-and-forward platform involving open source and proprietary add-on modules to enable monitoring and analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The primary purpose of this effort was to advance critical enabling features of a conceptual edge platform to the pilot stage in preparation for commercialization of products and services tuned for monitoring water quality and atmospheric conditions of Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) food production systems. Our target market is hydroponics and aquaponics commercial indoor farms. The research question was: <em>What is the feasibility of extending an open-source software framework and open hardware approach for productization of our ?on-premise? edge solution that does not require internet services to bridge the digital divide for rural and urban farmers? </em></p>\n<p><strong>Accomplishments </strong></p>\n<p>Using a modular design strategy, we established the feasibility of our open-source software framework and off-the-shelf sensor hardware approach to advance our sensor and edge platform prototype towards a pilot ready phase. We successfully transitioned the open-source software framework to a commercially supported version with IOTech Systems. We reduced our supply chain vulnerabilities while expanding our market potential by developing device profiles to include validation of an alternative commercially available sensor suite from another vendor, thus adding research-grade sensors to our product catalogue. We successfully implemented messaging protocols to transmit sensor data into the edge device services and made progress planning our user interface prototype involving a visualization engine and advanced data modeling capabilities.</p>\n<p>Customer discovery interviews informed iterative refinements to our early data visualization presentation layers to ensure that our <em>Cultivation Assistant</em> dashboard will be useful for consistent health monitoring, timely evidence-driven decision making, worker training, and coordinated collaboration amongst workers involving short and long-range farm management planning. Conversations with CEA producers also informed improvements to sensor array designs for both vertical and horizontal grow systems. We made progress on our farm site survey tool and developed the capability of auto-provisioning the monitoring system to make the out-of-the-box experience plug-and-play, reducing a potential barrier to adoption.</p>\n<p><strong>Products</strong></p>\n<p>Our LATERAL Edge monitoring platform will measure water quality and atmospheric conditions to support maintaining the health of biologically controlled environments. As timestamped readings captured at routine intervals from multiple interoperable sensors are fused, future <em>local </em>system analytics will involve machine learning to enable automated monitoring and message notifications to help users balance sensitive biochemical relationships, anticipate, and avert imbalances that lead to extra labor and wasted resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Participants/Organizations </strong></p>\n<p>Our technical development partners are Intel Corporation, IOTech Systems, and independent consultant engineers Dalyn McCauley, Colin Hale-Brown, and Karl Allen who contributed to software and hardware R&amp;D. We are partnered with two commercial CEA farms, Live Local Organic aquaponics farm and Northwest Transplants hydroponics and aquaponics farm, and with an Oregon State University agricultural research station where we will conduct field testing of our pilot product and services.<strong> <br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Impact</strong></p>\n<p>This feasibility study established strong evidence that our approach to providing AgTech solutions using an open platform approach to address handling open data has a high potential for reducing risks in CEA by providing data intelligence with interoperable hardware and software solutions that synthesize and interpret sensor readings to make data readily useful and secure without requiring reliable access to high-speed internet within the indoor farm.</p>\n<p><strong>Changes/Problems</strong></p>\n<p>Importantly, we are specifically designing our monitoring platform not to de-skill farmers by transferring all decision-making authority to machines and algorithms. Rather, we are developing quick-witted data inclusion tools to transform process-driven agricultural systems into smarter, data-driven systems. Given that farmers are experiencing steadily increasing production expenses counteracting their net profits, the potential to lower risks and therefore costs, represents a significant advantage for ensuring successful adoption of CEA that increases food security.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Food Safety Modernization Act, <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/353\">Pub. L. 111-353</a> (2023) recommends farms switch to digital recording of ?actual values and observations obtained during monitoring? with the goal of enabling traceability of food production to ensure food safety. The full compliance date for the Food Traceability Rule is January 20, 2026. Currently, most CEA farms are out of compliance of section 204(d)(1) of this landmark legislation (Stanek, 2023). The progress we accomplished herein will help overcome barriers to adoption of AgTech digital monitoring solutions due to lack of reliable high speed internet connectivity on the farm preventing access to cloud computing, proprietary application interfaces, and closed data schemas to fuse disparate dataset sources will help move the dial toward democratizing access to IoT innovations. Ultimately, this will assist CEA growers to be able to achieve compliance with legislation while growing healthy specialty crops using a fraction of the resources typically used to grow the same crops outdoors.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading this report.
