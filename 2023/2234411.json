 "awd_abstract_narration": "As our population ages and regional health disparities grow, significant financial and emotional burdens are imposed on our society, patients, and their families. Advances on many fronts are needed to impact the needs of these patients and assist them in prolonging their autonomy by keeping them in their homes longer and providing a higher level of health monitoring. The Center to Stream Healthcare In Place (C2SHIP) has been established to address these challenges and the six university sites for C2SHIP are University of Arizona, Baylor College of Medicine, University of Southern California, California Institute of Technology, University of Missouri, and the University of North Dakota (UND). C2SHIP brings together leading experts in academic medicine and the biomedical industry to research, develop, and promote in-place care technologies for managing chronic diseases in the home.  \r\n \r\nC2SHIP has three major thrusts: 1) promoting in-place care technologies, 2) academic-industry partnership & resource sharing, and 3) educating a workforce with the capacity for promoting wellness. In the first two thrusts, C2SHIP's trans-disciplinary innovation and research teams focus on developing new material-based sensors, reconfigurable designs, and system integration with data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. By using the \"Internet of Things,\" technological approach, patient data can be streamed in real-time to medical professionals in remote locations, creating a mobile hub for vulnerable patients in their homes.  \r\n \r\nIn addition to the first two thrusts, UND contributes expertise to C2SHIP in two unique areas: 1) an innovation-based learning (IBL) model for transdisciplinary student development and 2) indigenous health graduate education. In innovation-based learning, student learning is assessed by developing value from fundamental principles of their discipline while working on transdisciplinary teams.   \r\n\r\nAs with industry 4.0 skill sets, education 4.0 skill sets are distributed across the professional, innovation, and STEM categories using tools such as epistemic network analysis, big data, and learning analytics. Student engagement in the proposed research/innovation projects will create opportunities for multidisciplinary participation at C2SHIP conferences and workshops. UND also adds value to C2SHIP with an important connection to Indigenous people through collaborations with the Indigenous Health Department at UND.  Graduate students from this program are our \u201chuman-in-the-loop\u201d in the indigenous community looking for health gaps that can be used to inspire solutions within the C2SHIP and IBL process that engenders a knowledgeable workforce for promoting wellness.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
