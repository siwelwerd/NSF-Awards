 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The goal of this project is to develop interventions that will attract, retain and mentor students in the Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering at Florida A&M University (FAMU).\r\n\r\nEffective mentoring of students at HBCUs plays a pivotal role in their success and it is critical that innovative interventions are infused into undergraduate curriculums to successfully retain, and graduate students historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines. This project aims to 1) develop curricular enhancements in collaboration with industry partners, 2) engage students in 3D bioprinting research projects, and 3) provide students with internship opportunities at national labs. These efforts will not only retain students in the Chemical and Biomedical Engineering Department at FAMU, but more importantly, motivate and help students to see the principles of science in play in real world applications, thus providing them with the requisite knowledge base and technical skills to increase job prospects and competitiveness for graduate school.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
