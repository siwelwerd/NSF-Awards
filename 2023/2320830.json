 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award, jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) supports the acquisition of a new single crystal X-ray diffractometer at New Mexico Highlands University (NMHU). The new capability enables the characterization of the molecular and crystal 3-dimensional structure of synthesized and natural crystalline solids. Materials research activities, involving undergraduate and graduate students, use the instrument in the discovery of these newly synthesized compounds, materials and minerals. The mixing of students from different disciplines (e.g., chemistry, geology) into the scope of laboratory research and training brings a fresh perspective to fully realize the cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry. The new instrument helps to provide training in the form of crystallography workshops, mineralogy and materials seminars, and other courses in a friendly environment at a minority serving institution that allows students to find pathways in their career at academia, national laboratories, and industry.\r\n\r\nThe single crystal X-ray diffractometer is equipped with the latest technology on area detectors and on micro focus X-ray sources. The identification by X-ray diffraction methods of the molecular structures and 3-dimensional configurations are the first steps in the design of the new cutting-edge materials. The instrument facilitates inter-disciplinary and inter-university research such as (i) oxide inclusions in silicate minerals, light emitting diodes, and pharmaceuticals at NMHU (ii) semiconductors and solar cells in collaboration with the University of Colorado Boulder, and (iv) metal organic frameworks inclusions and magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents in collaboration with the NSF BioPACIFIC MIP. These research activities expose students to technical and essential skills such as data processing, critical thinking, and interdisciplinary competency.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
