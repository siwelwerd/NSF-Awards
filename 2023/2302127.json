 "awd_abstract_narration": "The RET Site: A Year-Long NanoEngineering Exploration from the Lab to the Classroom is a three-year program hosted by Rice University and designed to bring cutting-edge nanoengineering research in sustainable energy transition, clean water, and improved diagnostics and therapeutics into 5th-12th grade science classrooms. The program works with high-needs school districts in the greater Houston area, supporting twelve science teachers each year as they conduct research with Rice University's top-tier nanoengineering research faculty and facilities. The program includes a 7-week immersive laboratory internship and support throughout the academic year. The program aims to enhance the content knowledge and understanding of nanoengineering research processes of 5th-12th grade science teachers as they develop engaging nanoengineering lessons and activities centered on research practices. By building leadership capacity in RET participants, the program plans to increase student interest in STEM careers while encouraging underrepresented minority participation in the STEM workforce. The program also aims to establish a network of teachers actively learning about nanoengineering and disseminating their findings through cohort-building with partner school districts that serve historically underrepresented STEM students. The RET program aims to bring the excitement of cutting-edge nanoengineering research into the classroom and inspire the next generation of STEM leaders. Ultimately, the RET program seeks to create a cadre of motivated, creative, and diverse educators who will foster future STEM innovators while contributing to the development of a prepared, diverse STEM workforce. By connecting industry mentors with 5th-12th grade science teachers and their students, the program hopes to provide insights into engineering career opportunities and trajectories.\r\n\r\nThe RET Site: A Year-Long NanoEngineering Exploration from the Lab to the Classroom is a three-year program hosted by Rice University and designed to bring cutting-edge nanoengineering research in sustainable energy transition, clean water, and improved diagnostics and therapeutics into 5th-12th grade science classrooms. This RET Site includes a professional development (PD) program that aims to bring cutting-edge advancements in nanoengineering research regarding sustainable energy transition, clean water, and improved diagnostics and therapeutics into 5th-12th grade science classrooms. The program works with high-needs school districts in the greater Houston area, supporting science teachers as they conduct research with Rice University's top-tier nanoengineering research faculty and facilities. The program includes 7-week immersive laboratory internships, collaborative leadership, and PD support throughout the academic year. Each year, a cohort of 12 RET participants will disseminate program outcomes. The objectives are to: enhance 5th-12th grade teachers' content knowledge and understanding of nanoengineering research processes; develop nanoengineering lessons and activities for 5th-12th grade science classrooms centered around research practices; build the leadership capacities of RET participants; and establish a network of teachers actively learning about nanoengineering and disseminating RET outcomes through cohort-building with partner school districts serving historically underrepresented STEM students. Industry mentors will provide 5th-12th grade science teachers and their students insights into engineering career opportunities and trajectories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
