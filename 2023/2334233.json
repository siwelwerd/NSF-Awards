 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together leading experts on energy transitions to design energy research priorities and strategies across the social sciences. The project centers around a planned conference on the decarbonization of energy systems, convening specialists based in a range of academic, non-profit, and community-based organizations. Project participants build on their diverse experiences of scholarly and engaged work to advance a common set of goals: better management and anticipation of the many social and environmental impacts that result from changes to energy systems. Specifically, this project studies impacts of decarbonization associated with (1) transitions in fossil fuel infrastructure, and (2) the phase-in of new forms of energy, particularly the mining and use of lithium, needed for batteries found everywhere from electric vehicles to large-scale stationary batteries that store wind and solar electricity.\r\n\r\nThis project establishes national and global best practices for fossil fuel decommissioning and the development of new energy initiatives. Industry, community organizations and governments are central actors in energy sector transitions. However, there is a lack of regulatory standards for fossil fuel decommissioning and other policy arenas relevant to energy transitions. This context presents both challenges and opportunities. The design of this research consists of the following core elements: 1) online mapping of energy transitions, 2) identifying best practices for energy transitions, and 3) community engagement in energy transitions. This project advances the formulation and application of justice principles within energy-related decision-making processes. Drawing on current expertise, participants advance just transition principles, environmental justice, and equity into processes of energy system decarbonization, rather than as separate components of energy change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
