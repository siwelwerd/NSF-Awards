 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Florida seeks to address the underrepresentation of Black women and girls in computing, a critical issue that impacts both the advancement of science and the overall welfare of our society. Through the analysis of semi-structured interviews from the Modern Figures podcast and the collaboration of researchers, stakeholders, and the community, the project aims to build capacity for research collaborations and generate evidence-based strategies to broaden participation in computing. By uncovering the real, lived experiences of Black women and girls in computing, this project not only advances the field by identifying gaps in existing literature but also supports community and collaboration among key stakeholders. The project's outcomes have the potential to benefit society by ensuring that the advanced technology workforce includes all members, contributing to a more equitable and innovative future.\r\n\r\nThis Broadening Participation in Computing Demonstration Project has two primary goals: first, to conduct a thematic analysis of the semi-structured podcast interviews on Black women and girls in computing, identifying factors that promote interest, recruitment, persistence, and well-being in computing fields; and second, to foster research collaborations and knowledge exchange through a roundtable, scoping review, and listening sessions with the Black Women in Computing (BWiC)  Reseach community. By analyzing the collected data and commissioning thematic reports, the project will contribute to the understanding of the challenges and needs of Black women and girls in computing, generating evidence-based strategies for broadening participation. The roundtable will bring together researchers and stakeholders, facilitate collaboration, sharing of resources, and the development of strategic research agendas. The project's impact will be measured by the increased research collaboration, research community engagement, and dissemination of findings to a broader audience of researchers and practitioners through the listening sessions. Ultimately, this work seeks to advance the field, promote diversity, and benefit society by ensuring that the advanced technology workforce is inclusive and reflects the full range of talent and perspectives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
