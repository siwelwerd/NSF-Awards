 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nMichigan State University (MSU) has maintained a strong tradition and continuing trend in conducting fast-growing cutting-edge multidisciplinary research areas critical to the success of Chips and Science Act 2022 and Critical and Emerging Technologies, like semiconductors, microelectronics, energy, sensors, biomedical technologies, quantum technologies etc. This project seeks to request an Oxford PlasmaPro 100 Estrelas Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) system - targeting precision, rapid, flexible, high-aspect-ratio deep silicon etching to create diverse micro/nanostructures to accelerate these cutting-edge research areas at MSU and in Midwest Michigan. The Estrelas DRIE instrument is a unique cutting-edge deep silicon etching system that offers exceptional flexibility and throughput to fabricate various micro/nanostructures on semiconductors with fast speed (etch rate > 28 \u00b5m/min), and high aspect ratio (> 70:1). The instrument will be housed at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Research Cleanroom (ERC), a multidisciplinary shared research facility available to both MSU and external users. With the Estrelas DRIE, MSU will become a regional hub for providing advanced and flexible semiconductor processing support to users from MSU as well as other institutes and local companies in Midwest Michigan. The instrument will immediately benefit a diverse team of investigators and their cross-disciplinary research projects from 4 different departments and 2 colleges at MSU and other institutions including Fraunhofer USA Center Midwest, University of Nevada Las Vegas, and University of Buffalo. The associated research is expected to produce numerous patents to be translated into practical use. Besides research benefits, the Estrelas DRIE will serve as an educational tool for training interdisciplinary researchers and engineers in semiconductor, micro/nanoengineering, biotechnologies, energy, physics, environmental science, etc. \r\n\r\nThe requested Estrelas DRIE will stimulate the development of MSU\u2019s rapidly growing research areas, including semiconductors, microelectronics, energy, sensors, biomedical technologies, quantum technologies etc. The capabilities of the requested  Estrelas DRIE will open many new avenues of research in the following major areas: (1) Wide bandgap semiconductors: diamond semiconductor nanomembrane transfer to create diamond-on-GaN power devices; (2) Renewable energy harvesting and storage: understanding of mechanical degradation of next-generation high-capacity electrodes; novel engineered surface development for enhanced electricity generation when liquid flows over surfaces; (3) Sensors, MEMS and Systems: VO2 thin film coated MEMS spectrophotometer to re-direct a light beam to different places; low-cost and highly sensitive fiber-optic temperature sensors; (4) Biomedical technologies: neural miniaturized implants for seamless communication with the brain and the nervous systems; high-bandwidth silicon-based neuroprobes to assess a large number of neurons; wearable microfluidic systems to monitor personal exposure to airborne; intelligent micro robots integrated with multifunctional microdevices; (5) Quantum technologies: diamond nanopillars to enhance photon extraction efficiencies as the carriers for quantum information; diamond membrane for quantum applications. The requested Estrelas DRIE is an essential enabling tool that will not only address the critical need of a diverse group of researchers to expedite their current/future research, but also promote multidisciplinary collaborations between engineers and scientists within the department, across MSU, and beyond the institution. Additionally, the requested Estrelas DRIE instrument will expand the existing micro/nanomanufacturing capabilities at MSU and serve the needs of broad micro/nanoscale science, engineering, and technology. By accelerating these state-of-the-art research areas, the instrument will also serve as an important tool to create scientific training and artistic works to attract students, especially from the underrepresented groups, to pursue STEM education and research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
