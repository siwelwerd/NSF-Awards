 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds Student Travel Fellowships for students from the United States (US) attending 2023 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data. SIGMOD will be held in Seattle, Washington, USA from June 18 to June 23, 2023. The Student Fellowships will help cover the travel costs for a diverse group of US students, allowing them to attend the conference, disseminate their work, and discuss it with other attendees from academia and industry. The conference also allows students to interact with future national and international scientific collaborators. In this edition, the conference incorporates events specifically designed for students to participate in discussions with each other and to engage with the general audience.\r\n\r\nThe SIGMOD conference, established in 1975, has a dynamic and comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction, including research papers, tutorials, panels, industrial papers, technical demonstrations, and undergraduate research papers. The program includes publications relating to all aspects of data management defined broadly and particularly encourages publications on topics of emerging interest in the research and development communities. The program also includes workshops that showcase dedicated coverage due to their relevance to the current data management research and development, industrial exhibits, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry. All these activities provide a unique opportunity for students to share their knowledge, experience, and research work with internationally recognized researchers from academia and industry. In recent years, more than 800 attendees attended SIGMOD, and we expect similar numbers this year.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
