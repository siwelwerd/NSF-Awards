 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Regional Innovation Engines Development Award is focused on research-driven discovery, development, translation, and commercialization of sustainable manufacturing technologies essential for both production and products. The project fills a vital gap in the nation's ecosystem for problem-solving research, manufacturing output, robust supply chain management, livable wage jobs and opportunity structures, and socio-environmental stewardship. Northeast Ohio was the nation's manufacturing powerhouse, but poorly aligned institutions and unsustainable manufacturing practices have left a legacy of disinvestment, inequity, and environmental hazards across the region's 18 urban, suburban, and rural counties. The region of service extends across Northeast Ohio to create a robust network of industry, government entities, community groups, and leading research and academic institutions committed to problem-solving use-inspired research, innovation, technology translation, and workforce development. Led by Case Western Reserve University, the project's leadership includes Greater Cleveland Partnership, Team NEO, MAGNET, JumpStart, City of Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, Cleveland State University, Cleveland Water Alliance, Northeast Ohio Hispanic Center for Economic Development, and Urban League of Greater Cleveland. \r\n\r\nThe award efforts will focus on the creation of a robust, cooperative, aligned, and equitable framework for the substantial elevation of discovery and adoption of solutions in energy science, electrochemistry, green steel and chip production, carbon capture, storage/sequestration, and utilization, as well as alternatives to petroleum-based plastics, packaging, and biodegradable byproducts. We seek to reduce embodied energy, energy, and water usage, greenhouse emissions, all while transitioning to material circularity and sustainable energy, including process electrification. Robust and equitable job and opportunity structure creations are fundamental and woven into every activity. The planning effort will be driven through four integrated workstreams: Technology Innovation (problem-solving use-inspired research), Technology Adoption (translation, commercialization, adoption, Workforce and Talent Development (pathways, programs, pipelines), and Intentional Leadership and Governance (equity-focused leadership and governance). This award will prepare the region for an NSF Engine and an equitable and vibrant ecosystem that catalyzes innovation, accelerates sustainable technologies' translation, and develops a broader, more diverse workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
