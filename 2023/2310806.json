The technical program\r\nwill integrate oral sessions, poster presentations, and social activities, in a way that provides\r\nnumerous opportunities for discussion and interaction between researchers at all levels, from world\r\nleaders to student researchers.\r\n\r\nThe conference will benefit society by advancing the development of materials and devices needed\r\nfor several engineering grand challenges, including infrared emitters and detectors for homeland\r\nsecurity, pollution detection, information and communication technology, and sustainable energy\r\nconversion. The conference will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching,\r\ntraining, and learning by bringing together students and researchers with broad areas of expertise to focus on\r\ninfrared materials and the novel devices enabled by these materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
