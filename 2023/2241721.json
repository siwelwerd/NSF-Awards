 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microbes are important players in the carbon cycle in the ocean. These organisms consume organic carbon and produce carbon dioxide in marine systems. Because the average depth of the ocean is 4000 m, microbes must work at high pressures typical of the deep ocean (>1000 m). Although high pressure is known to affect marine microbes, their carbon cycling activities have mostly been measured at surface ocean pressures. As a result, it remains unknown how closely these measurements reflect the activities of deep-sea microbes at high pressures. As a result of collaborations with scientists in Denmark and Germany, this project will be able to use special equipment to investigate the effects of high pressures on marine microbes and their carbon cycling activities. This work is necessary to quantify rates of carbon cycling and identify the microbes involved, especially in deep waters. The project will provide training for diverse undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoc who will conduct novel research in the U.S., Denmark, and Germany, both at sea and in the lab. The scientists will also teach middle school students about the role of microbes in the carbon cycle and pressure effects on life in the ocean. The project will provide internships for high school students, focusing on first-generation students who would like to go to college. This work may aid in future efforts to identify enzymes that function well under high pressure. \r\n\r\nHeterotrophic microbes (e.g., bacteria and archaea) are found throughout the ocean. Their biogeochemical functions help determine the rates and locations at which carbon and nutrients are regenerated, as well as the extent to which organic matter is preserved. Although research has shown that pressure profoundly affects the activities of marine microbes, most investigations of microbial communities of the deep sea are conducted at atmospheric pressure, due to the limited availability of specialized equipment. In collaboration with the Danish Center for Hadal Research at the University of Southern Denmark, this study will identify the effects of pressure on microbial communities and their extracellular enzymes of pressures characteristic of bathy- and abyssopelagic depths. At sea and in the lab, the scientific team will compare the effects of depressurization on the activities of enzymes produced by microbial communities of the deep ocean, as well as the effects of high pressure on surface-water derived enzymes and communities. Fieldwork will take place in Danish coastal waters, well as in the open North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Using pressurization systems and in situ incubations, this study will measure hydrolysis rates of peptides and polysaccharides, two of the major classes of marine organic matter. Project activities will also focus on developing the means to measure enzyme activities in situ in the deep ocean. In collaboration with colleagues from the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Germany, this proect will additionally investigate whether pressure affects the selfish uptake of polysaccharides. These studies will provide new insight into understudied but key factors that help determine the fate of organic matter in the deep ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
