 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a series of conferences and workshops in game theory and applications of game theory. The conference, follow-on workshops, and lectures are held each summer as a coordinated program designed to bring together a distinguished group of senior scientists from around the globe with junior faculty and graduate students from across the U.S. Topics include new developments in game theory, areas in the intersection between game theory and computer science, and applications of game theory to business and public policy. The activities advance science by giving young scholars the opportunity to form new research collaborations and present their work to a distinguished audience.\r\n\r\nTopics include cooperative game theory, consumer data and privacy, fairness and computation, cooperation in repeated games, agents with misspecified models, learning and bounded rationality, coordination and contagion in networks, credible communication in market contexts, matching theory, mechanism design, strategic queuing, and methodological advances in experimental economics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
