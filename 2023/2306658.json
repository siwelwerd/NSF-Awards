 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provides support to strengthen STEM undergraduate education and research at HBCUs. This project at North Carolina Central University (NC Central) is a collaborative project between computer science and environmental science faculty at NC Central, social science researchers at Cynosure Consulting, and geography and biology faculty at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. This project aligns with the goals of HBCU-UP in its effort to provide support for research that seeks to create and study new theory-driven models and innovations related to the participation and success of underrepresented groups in STEM undergraduate education. The project at NC Central will conduct research on the impact of introducing social justice-based environmental science project-based learning (PBL) modules on student interest in environmental science and the declaration of majors. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to increase the participation in environmental science, one of the least diverse STEM fields, among students from historically marginalized communities.  The project innovation will be incorporated within an existing gateway course at NC Central University (ENSC 1000: Introduction to Sustainable Planet) by introducing data science for environmental justice project-based learning (DSEJ-PBL) modules. This project will study whether and how the innovation increases interest in environmental science using a mixed-methods approach to measure the efficacy of the innovation and its impacts on participants, and to provide insight into how the innovation produces changes in student beliefs, choices, and actions. The website that will be created through this project will host a repository of detailed DSEJ-PBL modules and associated tutorials and instructor materials. The research results from this project will be disseminated to the STEM and Education academic communities through presentations at seminars and conferences and publications in journals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
