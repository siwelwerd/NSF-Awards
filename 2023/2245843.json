 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding supports the logistics for a conference, the Mid-Atlantic Bight Physical Oceanography and Meteorology (MABPOM) meeting. This conference features presentations on diverse topics that span a geographic range from the Gulf of Maine to south of Cape Hatteras. Presenters include graduate students and early-career professionals. These presenters have unique opportunities to interact with senior researchers. The conference seeks to widen the participation of members of groups that are underrepresented in physical oceanography and meteorology.\r\n\r\nThe MABPOM meeting deals with the oceanography and meteorology of the Mid-Atlantic Bight. It also includes studies in the Gulf of Maine, south of Cape Hatteras, and estuaries on the East Coast of the U.S.A. The meeting foments student and cross-disciplinary, as well as preliminary and provocative presentations. The informal setting of the meeting enhances feedback to presenters, and promotes interactions and exchanges between senior scientists, mid- and earlier career researchers, postdocs and students. This meeting also features studies inspired by the NSF-sponsored Pioneer Array. As Broader Impacts, this meeting allows increased participation of MAB researchers and stakeholders. Participation of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) is particularly encouraged. Recruitment and support efforts are part of this funding request. This MABPOM meeting will help coordinate region-specific discussions on climate change and the blue economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This conference satisfies the need of bringing together and fostering interactions and exchanges between senior scientists, mid- and earlier career researchers, postdocs and students to discuss and advance new and traditional research directions related to the Middle Atlantic Bight regions. We had 38 presentations (9 posters) and about 50 attendees (47 registered) from over 10 institutions, as well as an NSF PO program manager in attendance. The meeting showcased and highlighted the strengths of our regional mid-Atlantic Bight coastal research programs. It was also a strongly interdisciplinary meeting with presentation topics covering larger-scale issues related to climate change in the northwest Atlantic and Gulf Stream dynamics; intermediate-scale issues, such as research that related to the shelf circulation and estuaries, which is important for understanding hypoxia and blue crab larvae survival, and exposure to pollutants, such as microplastics; estuarine urbanization in rising coastal floods; technology to equip sharks that can be used for ocean-observing applications in the Mid-Atlantic Bight; as well as anthropogenic carbon accumulation in the U.S. East Coast, and offshore wind technologies. The meeting also accomplished the regathering and organization of the regional physical oceanography and meteorology community after COVID-19 restrictions.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Tobias&nbsp;Kukulka</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
