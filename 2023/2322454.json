 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, a Hispanic-serving institution in south Texas. Over its 6-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 30 full-time first-year students pursuing bachelor\u2019s degrees in mathematics, physics, chemistry, atmospheric science, and environmental science for up to five years. To further support scholars, the project will implement four important interventions. First is a summer bridge program that provides intensive immersion activities in mathematics and science for first-year students to help them transition smoothly into college. Second is a hierarchical mentoring program that utilizes evidence-based, student-centered academic and learning community support strategies to enhance students\u2019 learning experiences throughout the duration of the scholarship. Third is the development of workforce-ready marketable skills that include both technical and essential professional skills in collaboration with industry partners. Fourth, and finally, is a research/industry shadowing program that provides opportunities for students to engage in authentic research/industry experiences by working closely with mentors. Ultimately, student financial support combined with this wide range of high impact opportunities will prepare talented low-income students from South Texas to confidently enter the workforce as well-prepared scientists and engineers. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to increase the participation and completion rates of STEM degrees among low-income, high-achieving undergraduate students with demonstrated financial need. While there is clear evidence for the lack of diversity in much of the STEM workforce, examining the impact of various efforts at increasing participation in STEM fields is an ongoing effort. The scope of this project is to examine the impact of various interventions on students\u2019 STEM identity formation, academic achievement, graduation rates, and post-graduation placement. Differences in these measures between scholars and other STEM students will be compared in a multi-pronged assessment effort. The results of this work will advance understanding of the impact of a well-resourced scholarship program on student retention and success at a minority university. By fostering collaborative activities among scholars, peers, faculty, and industry mentors, the program seeks to create a thriving and inclusive STEM community in South Texas. Ultimately, the project aims to improve the quality and quantity of STEM professionals, addressing the demand for skilled workers in STEM fields within the region and beyond. Project outcomes will be shared broadly through the program website, academic publications, and conference presentations. This project is funded by NSF\u2019s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
