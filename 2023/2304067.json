 "awd_abstract_narration": "The function and stability of microbial communities in the ocean depends on exchanges of biological products and services between individual cells. Marine microbes are typically far apart from one another, so some of these exchanges occur through the release of products or services into the surrounding water, where they travel to other cells via simple diffusion. Understanding the degree to which such valuable products made by one organism are targeted to a specific partner, and how, has important implications for our understanding of the ecology and evolution of the marine microbiome. This project examines the role played by a poorly understood type of very small particle \u2013 extracellular membrane vesicles \u2013 in mediating functional interactions within the oceans. Extracellular vesicles are released by most marine microbes and are abundant in ocean waters, but our understanding of their functions remains in its infancy. As vesicles can contain diverse molecules, including active enzymes, and transport them between cells, they may work as a packaging and delivery system for goods and services traded between ecologically important microorganisms. Broader impacts of the project include providing hands-on research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students - including those from groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields - and the development of new active learning exercises to help increase knowledge about the roles microbes play in students\u2019 lives.\r\n\r\nThis project explores vesicle functions across multiple scales, combining -omics analyses, field experiments, and functional studies in cultures of diverse and ecologically important microbes to arrive at new understandings of vesicle contributions to cellular exchanges. These experiments incorporate an evolutionary perspective for exploring the range of vesicle functions and genetic mechanisms affecting their production, examining how their contents have changed in co-cultures of phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria following hundreds of generations of experimental laboratory evolution. Fundamental ecological questions are addressed concerning whether vesicles, and their associated functions, act as truly \u2018public goods\u2019 in the oceans or can instead be targeted to a subset of cells, possibly yielding \u2018club goods\u2019 that define interacting, cooperative networks. Collectively, this effort will generate new insights into the mechanisms marine microbes use to interact with one another, and experimentally define the functional potential and ecological impact of EV-mediated trafficking networks in the oceans. \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Biological Oceanography Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
