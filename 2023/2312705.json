 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethics in computer science research, and in particular in cybersecurity, is beyond issues considered by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs).  Unethical security research could cause significant harm to society and in turn hurt the research community. Researchers may lack clear guidelines and resources to address research questions.  \r\n\r\nThis workshop sponsors students to participate in the 2nd International Workshop on Ethics in Computer Security (EthiCS 2023), held in conjunction with the Network and Distributed Systems Symposium in February 2023.  The workshop is a venue for researchers, practitioners, and administrators, from security and other areas, to bring and exchange perspectives, lessons learned, and new insights into the guidelines and practices of ethical computer security research. As a result, it expects to help generate new guidelines for future ethical security research, to call for resources assisting security researchers, and to raise awareness of even implicit ethical concerns.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
