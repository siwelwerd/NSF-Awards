 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides travel support for US-based students and early career researchers to attend the CCGrid 2023 conference in Bangalore, India in May 2023. The supported participants will attend special mentoring sessions, present a poster, and learn from the leaders in the Cluster, Cloud, and Internet Computing areas of Computer Science. The participants will submit a proposal for travel support and an extended abstract of their work that will be published in the workshop proceedings of the conference. This provides a unique opportunity for students and early career researchers in the US to the CCGrid 2023 conference. \r\n\r\nCluster, Cloud, and Internet computing is fundamental to computer science and is the driving engine for future computing and the science and engineering research and education that now depends on it. The 23rd IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid 2023) is a leading forum to disseminate and discuss research activities and results on a broad range of topics in distributed systems, ranging from computing clusters to widely distributed Clouds and emerging Internet computing paradigms such as Fog and Edge Computing that support Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data applications. The conference features keynotes, technical presentations, posters, seven workshops, as well as the SCALE challenge featuring live demonstrations and the ICFEC 2023 conference. The conference places special emphasis on all aspects of equity, diversity, and inclusion in systems research. The conference will be held as an in-person event in Bangalore, India. Overall, the conference provides a forum for engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government to present their latest research findings in all aspects of cluster, cloud and Internet computing. It is also an important event for PhD students and early career researchers to connect to the world of parallel computing in research institutions, scientific laboratories, and industry. This project provides travel support for US-based students and early-career researchers and creates a cohort who will attend the conference (by supporting  a portion of their travel expenses), participate in the early career and students' showcase as well as the rest of the conference, discuss their work with each other and with colleagues, and build long-lasting supportive relationships for their careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
