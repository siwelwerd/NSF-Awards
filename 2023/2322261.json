 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an energy-efficient digital pump.  The proposed technology may provide a viable solution to the efficiency, emissions, and energy-saving challenges associated with traditional variable displacement pumps, commonly used in energy-intensive sectors such as construction, agriculture, aerospace, and automotive industries.  Decreased energy consumption and carbon emissions from digital pumps may play a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of climate change and enhancing air quality.  In addition, industry may leverage the digital pump to create new machinery that addresses the growing demand for improved performance, fuel efficiency, and regulation compliance. The advancement of high-efficiency digital pumps has potential for numerous scientific and practical applications, positioning it as a valuable tool leading to new developments and enhancements in machines and mechanical designs.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a high-efficiency digital pump that achieves higher energy savings compared to traditional pumps. The proposed digital pump technology utilizes variable geometry cams to control the pump's inlet and outlet valves. This technology offers advantages over electrically actuated digital pumps, including eliminating delays in the actuation process, consistent and reliable actuation profiles, and reducing potential energy waste. It also eliminates the need for data acquisition systems, complex controls, or added energy sources, resulting in a more cost-effective and sustainable solution. By advancing and contributing to the knowledge of fluid power systems, mechanical design, and actuation techniques, this technology has implications for a diverse range of applications. Its implementation may lead to improved efficiency and sustainability in several sectors, stimulating further research and innovation in sustainable energy, a crucial domain for combatting climate change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
