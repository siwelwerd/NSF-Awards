 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to support the participation of graduate students and other early-career researchers in the Second Drexel Waves Workshop, held March 30-31, 2023 at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. Wave propagation problems are ubiquitous in natural and engineered systems, arising in contexts such as fluid motion, optics, the motion of pedestrians and vehicles, systems from quantum physics, and more. \r\n\r\nFifteen researchers have been invited to deliver lectures on wave propagation problems of high current interest. The invited speakers have expertise including mathematical analysis, modeling, asymptotic theory, and high-performance scientific computing. Specific topics discussed include fluid mixing problems, stability and metastability of coherent structures, and stochastic effects on wave propagation. The conference webpage is located at https://www.math.drexel.edu/~ambrose/drexelwaves/secondDWW.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
