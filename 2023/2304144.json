 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF support will enable numerous students, early career engineers, and faculty members around the country to attend the 8th Thermal and Fluids Engineering Conference (TFEC), thereby leading to their significant intellectual benefit and professional development. The TFEC, organized by the American Society of Thermal and Fluids Engineers (ASTFE), is growing to be one of the leading platforms for presenting and discussing research advances in thermal and fluids engineering. Since its inception in 2015, TFEC has been organized in a progressively student-centric fashion by seeking firsthand input from the student attendees. In line with the students' top priority, the 8th TFEC will invite 17 plenary, keynote, and special talk speakers and facilitate their interaction with the students. This support will also enable the students to realize their second priority: networking and socialization.\r\n\r\nThe field of thermal and fluids engineering impacts a vast spectrum of our industry and society. New advances in this field prompted by increased attendance and collaborations at the conference through this support would help improve and optimize numerous applications of societal benefit such as gas and wind turbines, fuel cells, electric vehicles, electronic devices, freshwater production, power plants, industrial processes, and medicine among others. In addition, the organization of the Early-Stage Career Development program at the conference will aid in enhancing the professional development and career selection skills of both the current and the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
