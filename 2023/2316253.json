 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the participation of early career US-based mathematicians to attend the conference \u201cA Panorama of Homotopy Theory\u201d June 5-9, 2023, in Oxford, England and the conference \u201cHomotopy: Fruit of the Fertile Furrow\u201d June 12-16, 2023 in Cambridge, England.  In the last decade or more, the techniques of homotopy theory have permeated many fields of mathematics. The aim of these two conferences is to synthesize and present these developments. The core purpose of the project is to support the attendance and career development of emerging scholars from the United States, both to supply an opportunity to learn and an opportunity to present their own work. The second week, in Cambridge, is designed to feature new voices. The support from this award will benefit scholars from a broad selection of U.S. universities and diverse backgrounds; the intent is to maximize the effect on workforce development. \r\n \r\nThese conferences will bring together leading experts representing the directions of research which form the main branches of the subject: homotopy theory in chromatic, equivariant and motivic incarnations, spectral algebraic geometry, and interactions with mathematical physics and representation theory.  All these fields have seen major advances and changes in the last five years, and this is the first international conference in some time that synthesizes the major recent development. The expected attendance at these two conferences is large, and together they are a major nexus for the international algebraic topology community. More information on the conferences can be found at the websites: https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/topology/panorama-homotopy-theory (Oxford) and https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/hhhw06/ (Cambridge).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
