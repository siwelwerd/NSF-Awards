 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Shaowei Li of the University of California, San Diego is developing a method to measure how electrons move and molecular vibrations change as a function of both space and time when excited by short laser pulses in molecules and two-dimensional materials. These low-dimensional systems exhibit unique dynamics that are sensitive to nanoscale chemical variations, which are difficult to observe using existing microscopic techniques. The Li group is developing a new microscopy called hyperdimensional scanning tunneling microscopy (HD-STM) to study these materials with Angstrom spatial resolution and femtosecond temporal resolution. This approach has the potential to uniquely reveal details about atomic-scale ultrafast dynamics and potentially enable the manipulation of these dynamics on-demand. Dr. Li will also develop a five-week summer research program for high school and undergraduate students that focuses on increasing student interest in science.\r\n\r\nHyperdimensional scanning tunneling microscopy (HD-STM) couples STM with visible-infrared pump frequencies, THz (terahertz)-probe frequencies, and optical/photoluminescence spectroscopy to extract structure, chemical, and reactivity details about interfacial samples across a wide scale of space, time, and frequency. The Li  group will work to develop this instrumentation so that electron transfer and nuclear motion in molecules and low-dimensional materials can be observed with high resolution in the space, time, and frequency domains. By coupling high resolution STM with optical spectroscopy to do high spatial resolution visible-pump THz-probe spectroscopy, there is the potential to examine chemical structure and reactivity at surfaces down to a single atom or bond, with implications for a broad range of science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
