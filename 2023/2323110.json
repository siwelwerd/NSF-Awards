 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds an urban climate-focused workshop at the 2023 American Geophysical Union Annual Meeting in San Francisco.  The intent of the workshop is to bring together researchers that are working on urban climate with individuals that are implementing climate solutions in global cities.  The impact of the workshop should be felt through the improved ability of the climate community to develop actionable strategies that will lead to use-inspired urban research, the results of which can be applied to real-world problems.  The workshop will represent a diverse range of viewpoints from across the globe.\r\n\r\nThe conference leaders make the case that there is a substantial disconnect between basic and applied climate research and climate action in terms of language gaps, the lack of direct impact of published research, and the lack of understanding of the solutions that climate actors are implementing.  The workshop will serve the following objectives: (i) identify key dimensions along which urban sustainability solutions related to water, energy, heat, air quality, and climate adaptation vary across global cities, (ii) identify how research on urban sustainability solutions is enhanced by integrating researchers with an international community of practitioners, (ii) exchange knowledge to accelerate climate action to adapt and mitigate existing and future climate stressors, and (iv) bridge the gaps between urban climate research, climate action plans, and implementing them on a city or neighborhood scales.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is co-funded by the Physical and Dynamic Meteorology, Climate and Large-scale Dynamics, and Environmental Sustainability programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
