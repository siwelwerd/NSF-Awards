 "awd_abstract_narration": "Satellite-based radiometers serve a critical function for environmental sensing, including for climate and weather research. However, the means by which these radiometers function \u2013 in sensing emissions from atmospheric gasses and the ground \u2013 is also susceptible to human-made radio-frequency emissions, including from commercial broadband systems emitting near 24 GHz. In order to maintain the ability for radiometers to function, new techniques are necessary to mitigate the effects of these emissions. This project seeks to examine both the technical needs and means to mitigate the effects of interference, making use of both the development of new models and evaluation via the COLOSSEUM test platform. \r\n\r\nThis proposal describes work to examine the state of the art in microwave radiometers and requirements for operation into the near future. Using this information, the proposers will evaluate the means to meet these requirements in the face of radio-frequency interference, and both simulate and test these means for viability. This will focus on compatibility between remote sensing systems and large satellite constellations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
