 "awd_abstract_narration": "The team supported by this grant is organizing an annual research workshop, called the Midwest Programming Languages Summit (MWPLS), to bring together researchers and students from the greater Midwest region. In contrast to more formal conference and workshop venues organized by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), this informal research workshop will serve as a valuable forum for researchers and students to share in-progress research ideas and receive timely feedback to influence subsequent work. This will be particularly valuable because of the high concentration of programming languages researchers in the Midwest, and because it will provide graduate student researchers opportunities to network and further develop their research and presentation skills. The workshop will be organized at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI in Fall 2023, and in yet-to-be-determined locations in 2024 and 2025.\r\n\r\nThe main focus of the annual one-day event will be to present and share research ideas. The event will include approximately fifteen presentations on specific research projects, as well as a poster session that will accommodate many more. These talks and posters will span a variety of timely and relevant topics in programming languages research, such as type systems and program logics for software verification; program synthesis and its applications in different domains; high-performance compiler implementations for parallel and multi-core hardware; tools and techniques for software engineering, web application security; and the application of programming language technology to diverse settings such as quantum computing and human-computer interaction. Many of the presentations, conversations, and collaborations that take place at the Midwest Programming Languages Summit are likely to facilitate high-quality research results to be presented at formal conferences and workshops in the future. This grant will provide travel grants to students who may not otherwise be able to travel to MWPLS. The organizers will reach out to institutions that serve underrepresented groups to broaden participation.\r\n\r\nThe Midwest Programming Languages Summits will foster the programming languages research community in the Midwest region, by providing networking opportunities for researchers to develop collaborations across organizations and for students to develop connections with senior researchers and other graduate students that will help with their future careers. By strengthening the intellectual ties among researchers in the Midwest region, the graduate students will develop a community that will support them in their subsequent careers in research, industry, or other sectors. The workshops will also bring together students and researchers from a variety of organizations (research-focused universities, industrial research labs, and teaching-focused colleges), which will help new research ideas flow into classroom settings and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
