 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transport processes controlling the salinity distribution in an estuary vary dynamically with the river discharge, tides, and meteorological events. Most of our understanding of the transport processes is based on studies of the central reach of estuaries. The upper reach near the landward limit of the salt intrusion, has distinct physical characteristics that make transport processes different from the central reach. This project will combine in-situ and shipboard observations, dye release studies, and realistic high-resolution modeling to quantify tidal dispersion in the upper reach of the Delaware River estuary. Analysis of the observations and modeling will be closely linked through direct comparisons, and together they will be used to quantify dispersion rates and identify the mechanisms. Bathymetric features like channel constrictions and bends as well as anthropogenic modifications like piers and dredged channels are expected to be particularly important to creating salinity and velocity anomalies that lead to net landward transport. The Delaware is representative of many estuaries around the world where water supplies drawn from tidal rivers are increasingly threatened by landward shifts in the oligohaline reach with sea level rise, changing precipitation, and dredging. Specifically, drinking water intakes for the Philadelphia Water District (PWD) are located just upstream of the study region, and the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) controls river flow conditions to regulate the salt intrusion and protect the water supply for millions. This project will build on established relationships between the PIs and colleagues at both PWD and DRBC to identify knowledge gaps and link study findings to management decisions. The PIs will also contribute to a series of workshops bringing together scientists and water resources managers to assess threats to water supplies by salt intrusion globally. The project will support a graduate student at Rutgers who will be involved in all aspects of the study, including observations, modeling, and outreach.\r\n\r\nThe oligohaline reach (0.5-5 psu)  is an important transition zone for many ecological and biogeochemical processes, and yet few studies have examined the physical mechanisms of transport. Several key characteristics distinguish the oligohaline from the central estuary. In the asymptote to freshwater, the along-estuary salinity gradient decreases and estuarine exchange flow weakens. Stratification also decreases, reducing the steady salt flux and increasing mixing, which reduces oscillatory shear dispersion. Channel narrowing affects lateral exchange and trapping, particularly in urbanized estuaries with shoreline modification. This project uses multiple, complementary approaches to quantify transport processes in this region. Observations during low river discharge will capture the spatial and temporal evolution of salinity with tidal and meteorological forcing, and dye releases will directly quantify dispersion at the scale of topographic features. Modeling will use a nested-grid approach to represent the bathymetric features driving dispersion, along with a novel analysis approach to isolate sources of non-local salt flux, as put forth by Dronkers and van de Kreeke (1986). A process-based understanding of transport in the oligohaline reach is critical to understanding how conditions there will evolve with climate change and continued development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
