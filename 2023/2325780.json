 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation-Mid-Career Advancement (PFI (MCA)) project lies in the direct methane pyrolysis system that integrates hydrogen production, separation, and purification into a compact modular membrane reactor. This membrane reactor seeks to provide a low-cost, high energy-efficiency and zero-emission approach to producing hydrogen and solid carbon, enabling a hydrogen economy. Both emission-free hydrogen and carbon nanotube products from the proposed technology may offer economic value. The project provides a platform that enables the education of the next generation of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs, especially from the underrepresented student groups including women, minorities, and people with disabilities. The principal investigator will receive training and guidance from the senior mentor to develop skills to address the pain points of potential industrial customers.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to enable highly-efficient and durable membrane reactors for direct methane pyrolysis at moderate temperatures for production of decarbonized hydrogen and carbon nanotubes. These reactors address the underlying challenges in commercializing membrane reactors for hydrogen production from methane pyrolysis due to the scarcity of active and stable membrane and catalyst materials. The proposed research seek to advance the membrane reactor technology and foundational knowledge of surface crystallization of zeolites and methods to improve resistance of palladium-based membranes to gas impurities and the effects of hierarchical zeolite-supported catalysts on methane activation.  The team will also examine the  effects of spatial and temporal temperature control on methane pyrolysis in the reactor, as well as the predictive correlations of materials synthesis for the membrane reactors. The fundamental concepts and technologies obtained from this proposal may enable new avenues of material discovery and technique development that can impact the future hydrogen economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
