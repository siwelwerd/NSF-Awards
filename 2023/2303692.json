 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to build an open-source ecosystem around Open OnDemand, an NSF-funded web portal used by nearly 500 research computing centers around the globe to provide easy access to high performance computing (HPC) resources from anywhere and from any device. The project\u2019s novelties are a central model to support and strengthen the open-source online gateway, as well as a development plan to grow the user community, partnerships and sponsorships. The project\u2019s impacts are expanding access to research computing resources and bolstering the pipeline of researchers using HPC for innovation. \r\n \r\nThe project develops a managing organization that (1) builds a community of Open OnDemand developers, contributors and clients to facilitates the long-term sustainability of this critical platform for research computing infrastructure; (2) implements security and quality assurance processes and infrastructure that are specific to the needs of Open OnDemand; and (3) conduct market discovery research, in conjunction with an external consultant, to produce collateral to facilitate community growth and long term sustainability. Broader impacts of the project include the increased adoption of research computing resources across science domains and other research communities, improved collaboration between the public and private computing sectors and early engagement of students who will be future research computing clients.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
