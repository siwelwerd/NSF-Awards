 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital Twins are purpose-driven software entities that collect run-time data from an operating manufacturing system, and bring that data together with models (representing both historical and theoretical behaviors) to create outputs and metrics that can be used to improve the overall performance of the manufacturing system.  The development of Digital Twins requires significant subject matter expertise, where operators and engineers help determine the appropriate data to collect, modeling frameworks, and the most useful output metrics.  This planning grant will build industry partnerships and develop a set of research directions in the area of Digital Twins for Consolidated Manufacturing Intelligence.  Through a two-day workshop and multiple smaller conversations including the development of an industrial advisory board, industry partners will be engaged with university partners to develop a plan for a full IUCRC proposal.   The resulting research directions have the potential to improve overall manufacturing operations, increasing productivity, leading to more profitability for manufacturers as well as lower costs and higher quality for consumers. The proposed center will engage both undergraduate and graduate students in the research projects, giving them experience in working on relevant industrial research projects. \r\n\r\nThe research that will be proposed in the full IUCRC will relate to the development of methodologies and solutions for Digital Twins in the manufacturing industries.  Given the primary site at the University of Michigan, automotive manufacturers and tier suppliers will be engaged as partners.  As the system-level challenges are quite common across industries (even with very different processes), semiconductor fabrication and chemical process companies will also be engaged.  A common framework for Digital Twins will be used to extend and reuse manufacturing intelligence and provide practical solutions to support evolution from reactive to predictive, proactive and prescriptive solutions envisioned in smart manufacturing and industry 4.0/5.0. Contributions will be in defining research directions that allow the framework and its elements to be re-useable, interoperable, extensible, and maintainable, but also in defining the state-of-the-art and deriving a research and development roadmap for key Digital Twin enabled solutions such as predictive maintenance and virtual commissioning. The planning activities will make use of the SMART 4.0 testbed in the Ford Robotics Building at the University of Michigan, that includes both additive and subtractive manufacturing processes, mobile and fixed-base collaborative robots, and an integrated data and control platform.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe two primary outcomes of the planning grant were the organization of a center planning workshop (Jan. 8-9 at Univ. of Michigan) and the submission of a full proposal, together with Arizona State University, for a two-site IUCRC.\n\nIndividual meetings were held with more than 40 companies to discuss the research directions proposed for the center, and understand better the industry needs. Based on these conversations, three thrust areas were proposed for the center: Digital Twin Frameworks and Standards, Digital Twin Applications, and Digital Twin Tools and Workforce Development. Draft documents for the organization of the center, including bylaws, membership agreement, and operating guide, were developed.\n\nTwenty-three potential members attended the center planning workshop, and six members expressed interest but were unable to attend. The workshop included presentations of the proposed center organization, thrust areas, as well as eight potential center projects in three thrust areas. Specific feedback received from the industry participants was used to present updates on the projects on the second day of the workshop. After the response to the comments, a mock Industrial Advisory Board voted on which projects would have been selected for funding. Throughout the workshop, a common theme was repeated that an IUCRC is operated by its members, for its members.\n\nGraduate students from the University of Michigan and Arizona State University participated in the center planing workshop and presented posters on their current research related to digital twins. They were able to interact with industry partners and learn more about the challenges faced on the manufacturing plant floor. The industry partners were also able to learn more about the latest research advances in this area.\n\nIn addition to the student participation, broader impacts of the project relate to the industry-university partnerships, and improving overall manufacturing competitiveness by lowering costs and increasing quality.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/05/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DawnTilbury\n"
