The three-day workshop has four main goals: (1) provide opportunities for new and existing NSF CISE REU PIs and Co-PIs to share experiences directing undergraduate research programs and offer suggestions for improving all sites, (2) discuss best practices and challenges associated with the administration of an undergraduate research program, (3) provide networking and community-building opportunities for REU PIs, recognizing individual and group dedication to the importance of undergraduate research beyond home institutions, and (4) discuss the transfer of lessons learned from virtual to in-person REUs. The meeting will prepare attendees to host more impactful, inclusive, and research-generating REU sites. Resources will be shared in a publicly available website and summarized in a report and shared with all participants and the NSF community, as well as via the workshop website and Slack REU Site PIs workspace.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
