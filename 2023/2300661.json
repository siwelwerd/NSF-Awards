Participation in PerCom 2023 and similar conferences are valuable and important activities of the graduate school experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and exposes students to leading work and practical industry practices in this important area of research. This may have an important impact on career development. \r\n\r\nThe conference spans five days and will consist of technical paper presentations, panels, industry presentations, posters, and demonstrations. It will also feature keynote speeches from leading researchers and practitioners in the field. \r\n\r\nStudent travel to conferences is an important activity. Funds will be dispersed with preference given to students who would not otherwise be able to attend the conference and paying particular attention to diversity and relevance of the student's research interest.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
