 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need of recruiting, preparing, and retaining high-quality secondary STEM teachers who possess deep subject matter and pedagogical knowledge; well-developed knowledge and skills for integrating STEM content, processes, and practices; and a commitment to creating equitable and inclusive learning environments for diverse student populations. Numerous reports link K-12 STEM education to the U.S. effort to maintain its scientific and economic leadership in today\u2019s global economy. Through efforts targeting development of intern, scholar, and teacher content knowledge, teaching practice, and research skills, the project will position prospective STEM teachers from diverse backgrounds to effectively meet the needs of learners in high-need schools located in historically underserved communities. The thrust for this project will come from its foundation of fostering STEM teacher self-efficacy, incorporating inquiry-based laboratory experiences and field-based teaching experiences, and focusing intentionally on learning instructional practices that allow, invite, and encourage students to seamlessly maintain alignment between the culture at school and the culture in their home. In addition, the project activities aims to enhance understanding of how evidence-based instruction and authentic research experiences support preparation of prospective STEM teachers and the role this plays in retaining STEM teachers in the teaching profession. \r\n\r\nThis project at Southern University and A&M College, the main campus of the only Historically Black College and University System in the Nation, includes partnerships with the East Baton Rouge Parish School System, Southern University Laboratory School, experts in STEM education, and two NSF-funded research projects (1) Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory Science Education Center (LIGO SEC) Partnership and (2) California Polytechnic State University\u2019s STEM Teacher and Researcher Project (STAR). By leveraging culturally sustaining pedagogy and self-efficacy principles, this project aims to target the unique resources women and others from historically disenfranchised groups bring to teaching. Goals of this 5-year project include (1) engaging 15 interns in authentic STEM research experiences, (2) certifying 15 highly qualified STEM teachers, and (3) providing high-quality induction support for novice STEM teachers. At all project levels, participants will serve in high-need school settings. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
