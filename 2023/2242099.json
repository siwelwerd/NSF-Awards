 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lack of pediatric palliative care facilities continues to negatively impact the health of children suffering from cancer. This is further compounded by a lack of children\u2019s representations and voices in health. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, this doctoral dissertation project provides a scientific analysis of children\u2019s conceptualizations of care in relation to socio-cultural differences and historical circumstances which impact the everyday lives of community members, caregivers, and patients. By examining the engagement of children with palliative care practices, this dissertation project will disseminate its data and findings to impact the delivery of health interventions to be more sensitive and suitable for children\u2019s specific needs. The project also broadens the participation of historically underrepresented groups in the production of scientific knowledge. \r\n\r\nThis doctoral dissertation research project examines children\u2019s experiences with pediatric palliative care to determine how they produce individual meanings of care. It has three primary aims: (1) to document the lived experiences of pediatric cancer patients with palliative care and examine their everyday interactions with care providers; (2) to examine how care providers administer and engage in practices of palliative care; and (3) to investigate how socio-cultural factors affect caregivers\u2019 perceptions and practices of palliative care. To achieve these aims, the researcher will integrate visual methods (such as arts-based methods, participatory photography, participatory photo elicitation, and observational sketching) and conduct ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and archival research. Data will be thematically coded and analyzed to contextualize how children interact with palliative care practices, and whether communitarian social values may shape different ideas of care. This research contributes to anthropological theory on children\u2019s agency in health and improves theorizations of care to account for a more heterogeneous range of experiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nThe importance of palliative care to improve the quality of life of patients with life-limiting illnesses has already been globally recognized. However, discrepancies continue to persist regarding access to palliative care, particularly in lower-income countries. In India, majority of children suffering from cancer are currently in need of specialized pediatric palliative care, but the nationwide lack of palliative care units limits their access to specialized pain care.\n\n\n\n\nThis project explored the experiences of pediatric cancer patients undergoing palliative care in Delhi, India at the only center providing specialized palliative care support for children suffering from cancer in India. This project was conducted over 12 months and sought to examine how children experience and engage with different palliative care practices administered at the center amidst complex cultural, political, and economic histories affecting access to care. Through immersive participant observation and utilizing various visual methods, this project investigated how children interact with and comprehend their illness and related palliative care practices. This research identified how children actively participate and get involved in their healthcare needs and treatments, and express feelings of fear, anxiety, and hope regarding their illness. Through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, this research further explored the experiences of, and challenges faced by healthcare providers while administering different palliative care services. Interviews with patients family members also helped to identify community-level barriers to palliative care which highlighted gender and caste dynamics, the role of patriarchy in availing care, the stigma associated with cancer, and low levels of knowledge about cancer symptoms and related treatments. Through the collection of archival data and review of secondary documents, this research further contextualized the current infrastructure of pediatric palliative care within the functioning of the broader Indian health system. It expands upon issues regarding the visibility of pediatric cancer in India, the inability to get care at the right time due to population pressure, challenges of getting access to quality post-treatment care, and the need for proper training of healthcare workers, and connects them to the everyday experiences of children and their caregivers in the palliative care clinic.\n\n\n\n\nThis research contributes to the growing anthropological literature on childrens agency in health, and meanings and practices of care, by adding new insight into childrens social worlds in the context of uncertain cancer trajectories and palliation. By focusing on the palliative care journeys of children in their early adolescence, this research provides a much-needed perspective on childrens active participation in health from a lower-income country, as opposed to most research conducted with children living in high-income countries. Moreover, conducting this research in India has been critical for producing an informed analysis of the diverse meanings of care which challenges the conceptualizations of care as a monolithic, universal practice. This research further adds a critical anthropological perspective on the meanings of palliative care beyond just end-of-life care. In addition to the theoretical contributions, this research provides a space for several practical applications. Results from this research have been used to organize and inform local pediatric palliative care training sessions and have directly impacted the delivery of health interventions to be more sensitive and suitable for childrens specific needs. These programs have helped examine the importance of holistic pain care and palliation services while considering communitarian care values.\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/28/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ShreemoyeeSil\n"
