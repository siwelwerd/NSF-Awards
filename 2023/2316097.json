 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large mystery that is currently being investigated by the High Energy Physics (HEP) field is the origin and the nature of the Ultra-high energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR). Coming from deep within the Universe, they interact with Earth\u2019s atmosphere and multiply from a single particle with enormous energy to billions of particles with much lower energy, causing what scientists call Extensive Atmosphere Showers (EAS). Another current challenge in HEP and science in general is raising and training new generations of capable scientists to investigate the current mysteries and discover new ones. The shape of the EAS when it reaches the planet\u2019s surface is a disk of varying thickness, similar to magnifying glass \u2013 thicker in the center and tapering towards the edges. The main goal of this proposal is to develop a fast-speed detector system that is capable of recording cosmic ray events, digitized at high speed. From that data, the information of the disk thickness can be studied for the purpose of improving current EAS simulation software as well as developing and improving the existing methods for analyzing the data so that we can tell the origin of the particle, its energy, and its species (i.e., was it a neutron, a proton, or a nucleus of some element). Additionally, the capabilities of the detector will assist in the search for the new types of the EAS, such as Cosmic Ray Ensembles proposed by CREDO collaboration, and in the confirmation of the Unusual Events that were observed by the Horizon-T collaboration. Participation of undergraduate students in these activities with support and supervision will provide the training for the future scientists using the real experiment in multiple topics will provide hands-on research experience for a diverse student population supporting the groups underrepresented in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe intent of this proposal is to initiate the scalable research project in physics that can be subsequently extended. The project goal will be the development, design and construction and deployment of core modules of DUCK (Detector system of Unusual Cosmic-ray casKades). The main scientific importance for the DUCK project will be adding the capabilities of the high-speed full wavelength recording of the EAS events with different trigger possibilities, analysis of which would contribute: to general EAS event analysis methodology using the full waveform and detector response width, to CORSIKA simulation development and check of the current and upcoming versions (7 and 8), to the overall cosmic ray flux and space weather monitoring, to the search for the Cosmic Ray Ensembles by CREDO collaboration, and to an independent verification of the detection of the \u2018unusual\u2019 cosmic ray events by the Horizon-T detector system. The project will involve computer simulation activities, design and construction, data acquisition system design, data collection and analysis, allowing participation of students pursuing not only physics but also other STEM fields, such as Chemistry, Engineering and Computer Science. The project will extend the research potential and facilities at Clayton State University (CSU). This would serve as strong institutional support and encouragement of first-generation college students for whom there is often little family support for going to graduate schools after graduation from CSU.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
