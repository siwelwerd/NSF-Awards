 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, the research community has witnessed an explosive increase in the launch of spacecraft, particularly small satellites destined for Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This new era in space is primarily enabled by advancements in low-cost booster technology and the miniaturization of microelectronic (ME) devices. These developments have sparked rapid growth in both business and commercial applications, as well as in the expansion of space-based research; consequently, a large number of research groups are now developing technologies for space cyberinfrastructure (CI). However, a lack of systematic and principled practices in space operational procedures has led to insufficient utilization of space CI. Recent studies have reported a success rate of only 44% for small satellite projects. Most of these failures can be attributed to a shortage of a trained workforce who are updated with the latest operational practices, accustomed to the harsh conditions and microgravity in space, and proficient in working with the limited computing resources and network connectivity available. The burgeoning research opportunities in space underscore the need for adequate workforce training. It is essential to equip the next generation of researchers with the skills required for operating CI in outer space.\r\n\r\nTo accelerate and broaden the adoption of emerging space CI across diverse research domains, this project aims to design and implement an accessible training framework. This framework not only falls within an affordable cost range, but it is also flexible enough to meet the cyber and physical demands of diverse research fields. As a pilot project, the initial effort will involve creating a virtual testbed environment for space CI, an underlying technology for facilitating versatile framework support capable of integrating with various physical devices. To effectively reproduce realistic exterior conditions, the investigators will refer to real-world traces obtained from industry collaborators. To validate the vision for a comprehensive training framework that addresses the needs of various research communities, the proposed research includes a prototyping effort. This effort will be conducted in collaboration with materials science researchers who are currently focused on developing miniaturized sensors for space exploration. The major outcomes of the project will include training materials generated from two workshops planned for later stages. The first workshop will be geared toward experienced researchers, while the second will target undergraduate and graduate-level students with basic research experience. Both workshops will place particular emphasis on the potential benefits of the training program for underrepresented populations.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Community Infrastructure for Research in Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CIRC) program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
