 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides registration for approximately 15 students, postdoctoral fellows and early-career professionals studying and working in the US to attend the 7th World Congress on Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME 2023), Orlando, Florida, 21-25 May 2023, organized by The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (TMS). The objective is to broaden the participation from graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, early-career professionals, participants from underrepresented communities and women, and undergraduate students that aspire to learn more about the field of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME). Consideration in the selection process will be given to the inclusion of members of underrepresented groups, diversity of institutions that the participants represent, and diversity of programs within engineering. The aim is to showcase the latest research in the field, facilitate interdisciplinary discussions and grow the pipeline of US researchers interested in ICME, which has applications in several fields including materials design, structural and functional materials behavior, advanced manufacturing, energy storage and conversion, and artificial intelligence and machine learning.\r\n\r\nThe World Congress on Integrated Computational Materials Engineering is held bi-annually in different cities around the globe since its inception in 2011. It is considered the world\u2019s premier conference in the field of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering. ICME is an interdisciplinary approach to designing materials solutions for specific applications that use computer modeling programs to predict the behavior of materials and integrate this information into the overall materials, processing, and manufacturing design cycle. This integrated approach is one of the foundational pillars of Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), which combines and leverages computation and data techniques with traditional materials science and engineering to accelerate the discovery, development, and deployment of advanced materials \u201ctwice as fast and at a fraction of the cost.\u201d This conference brings together researchers from across the nation and internationally to share their research findings, foster and develop new collaborative ideas, and advance the professional development of a new generation of scientists and researchers with a modern, integrated skillset which can be used to address the materials challenges that impact society. The conference will include 15 symposia across 9 topical areas where the most recent and novel research will be presented.\r\n\r\nThis conference support is funded by the Mechanics of Materials and Structures (MOMS) and Advanced Manufacturing (AM) programs in the CMMI Division, and the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory (CMMT) and Metals and Metallic Nanostructures (MMN) programs in the DMR Division.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
