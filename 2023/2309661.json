 "awd_abstract_narration": "Particle suspensions are ubiquitous in nature; their study is featured in many areas of fundamental science and technology. Simulating them helps us understand properties of matter like jamming and phase transition, enables us to study of spontaneous formation of biological structures like cell membranes and cytoskeletons, and it allows us to design a vast array of smart materials, from damping fluids in Kevlar and prosthesis to self-assembling nanomaterials. However, the very properties that define these particle systems make them very challenging to simulate, as we must accurately reproduce their behavior for long periods of time. The overarching goal of this research project is to provide transformative improvements to state-of-the-art solvers for the numerical simulation of these particulate systems. By design, each of the contributions in this project has, on its own, foreseeable broad impact in multiphysics simulation and in numerical methods for scientific computing, and ultimately, in advancing our scientific and technological capabilities by enabling simulation methods to bridge the gap between theory and experiment. This project is integrated with ongoing educational initiatives, including the development of novel applied mathematics curricula and providing research opportunities for a diverse group of students. The project will include training of graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis research project involves the development of a fast simulation framework for rigid particulate suspensions. This work is centered around the formulation of long-range forces with Boundary Integral Methods and of short-ranged contact forces employing optimization-based methods, as this is ideal to effectively tackle the many-body interactions in dense particle systems. This framework features three separate contributions aimed at unlocking the full potential of this approach: (1) Fast singular and near-singular revaluation schemes to resolve long-range particle interactions and analyze integral operators for spheroidal, ellipsoidal and axis-symmetric geometries, enabling the study of a wide array of particle systems and confining geometries, (2) Structured preconditioners for boundary integral equations in evolving geometries leveraging prior work on structured matrices and tensor train decompositions to accelerate the solution of resulting linear systems of equations, and (3) Systematic, robust and adaptive acceleration method for optimization-based collision resolution using matrix-splitting schemes for viscous flow mobility matrices, which may be adapted to most formulations for particulate suspensions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
