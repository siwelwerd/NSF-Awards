 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is in the development of a harmful algal bloom (HAB) mitigation technology.  HABs are cyanobacterial plumes that are often acutely toxic to aquatic organisms, animals, and humans because of the cyanotoxins released by them. HABs have become an emerging threat to the recreational use of lakes and drinking water supplies. It is challenging for conventional centralized water treatment processes to mitigate HAB events and cyanotoxins that occur frequently and irregularly due to increased nutrient discharge and global climate change. The direct economic impact of HABs in the U.S. is estimated to be $50 million per year.  The proposed HAB mitigation technology aims to intercept of eliminate such blooms at the early stage. The technology is based on electrochemical oxidation and features faster removal of both cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins. The solution should also result in fewer disinfection byproducts compared with conventional chlorination and ozonation methods. The technology uses cheaper, locally sourced electrode materials thereby reducing capital costs and potential supply chain challenges. These improvements could make the technology accessible to larger customer base and as such, improve water quality for larger populations. In addition, energy consumption may be reduced significantly allowing for more effective treatment. The reduction in HABs would ensure the continued use of water resources for recreation, reducing health risks and increasing property values of lakeside residences. \r\n\r\n \r\nThe project is focused on the development of an innovative electrochemical technology to remove HABs safely and effectively from bodies of water. Removal of harmful algal blooms is accomplished through an electro-oxidation (EO) process that does not require the addition of any chemicals, is quick, and easy to use.  Phase I research and development will include the development of new electrode materials aimed at reducing the electrode costs by up to 50% by substituting the base metal and the dopant in the coated electrode material.  The team will also evaluate the environmental impact of the treatment process on non-algae model organisms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
