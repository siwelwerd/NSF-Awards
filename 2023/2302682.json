C.A.T.S. will feature eight research talks by faculty members in various stages of their careers, a set of five 10-minute lighting round talks by young researchers, and a poster session. The objective of the conference is to bring together a growing community of commutative algebraists located in the South for the purpose of showcasing new mathematics.\r\n\r\nCommutative algebra arose in the early 20th century as a subject to unify methods of algebraic geometry, representation theory, and number theory. The subject of commutative algebra is a continuously involving subject of mathematics which has seen recent successes in the solutions of the homological conjectures, Vasconcelos conjectures, applications to the mixed characteristic miminal model program, and applications of the theory of multi-graded commutative rings. C.A.T.S. is a scientifically important program that will be used to showcase new trends in the subject of commutative algebra and its applications to other disciplines. The website for the conference is https://cats-math.github.io/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
