 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in unlocking the potential to use aqueous colloidal emulsions instead of petroleum-based materials currently used to manufacture a multitude of products including packaging, building materials, coatings, paints, adhesives, cosmetics and even pharmaceuticals in the $26B polymer emulsion industry. Such a replacement would address the emerging national and global need to use sustainable raw materials and deliver net zero greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).  The resultant cleaner and greener products are likely to accelerate the chemical industry's shift towards bio-based products.  \r\n\r\nThis Phase I project proposes to create industrial cellulosic emulsions using solvated cellulose with the use of ionic liquids. The project aims to develop a high value, sustainable, recyclable solution that can be offered at the same or lower price as an acrylic emulsion, minimizing cost and maximizing throughput. The research will focus on the selection and pre-treatment of cellulose, the selection of ionic liquids and surfactants, emulsion process development, and optimization. Significant technical challenges are posed by the requirements for higher cellulose loadings, control of emulsion particle morphology, and emulsion stability, as well as the need to achieve an economically attractive cost structure. Additional challenges come from tuning these parameters for specific industrial applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
