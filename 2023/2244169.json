 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to The University of Iowa, located in Iowa City, IA, will support the training of 10 students each year for 10 weeks during the summers of 2023-2025. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. The primary objectives of the program are to generate new knowledge and to strengthen our nation\u2019s STEM workforce by encouraging students to pursue a career in basic science and giving them skills to succeed in that path. Students will learn how microbiology research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done through the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be required to register their participation in the NSF\u2019s ETAP website.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the program is host-pathogen interactions involving bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Each student will conduct an independent laboratory research project under the guidance of a faculty and a graduate student or postdoctoral co-mentor from the Department of Microbiology and Immunology. Participants will be instructed in communicating their research in short talks, a written report, and a campus-wide poster session. Participants will also attend workshops, seminars, and social functions to broaden their understanding of microbiology, graduate school, career options, and responsible conduct of research. Applications will include a form, personal statement, information on career goals, research interests, two letters of recommendation, and college transcripts. Prior research experience is not required. Students are selected by the program directors based on their academic record, letters of recommendation, and potential for outstanding careers involving microbiology research. More information about the program is available by visiting https://medicine.uiowa.edu/microbiology/education/summer-research-experience-undergraduates-reu-microbiology, or by contacting the PI (Dr. David Weiss at david-weiss@uiowa.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Gina McGrane at regina-mcgrane@uiowa.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
