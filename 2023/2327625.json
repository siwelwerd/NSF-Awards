 "awd_abstract_narration": "International Indian Statistical Association (IISA) 2023, a four-day international conference, will take place at Colorado School of Mines (Mines), Golden, Colorado from June 1 to June 4, 2023. The conference is an important event for researchers, students, and professionals in statistics, biostatistics, and data science. The conference provides a platform for emerging young researchers and students to share their theoretical and methodological research and applications in various scientific fields. It aims to promote the education, research, and application of statistics, probability, and data science while also fostering the exchange of information and scholarly activities among members. With a focus on diversity and inclusion, the conference provides numerous opportunities for women, minorities, and early-career researchers to participate in student paper competitions, speed sessions, short courses, plenary talks, invited sessions, and poster presentations. The conference also hosts a vibrant multi-stage student paper competition, highlighting the best research among early-career scholars.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective, IISA 2023 covers a wide range of topics from the fundamentals of statistical theory to computationally intensive methods and scientific application-oriented data modeling. It provides an opportunity for researchers and students to share their research in a variety of formats such as plenary talks, special invited talks, invited sessions, student paper competitions, posters, and panel discussions. The conference is an official annual meeting of the International Indian Statistical Association, and its main objective is to promote education, research, and application of statistics, probability, and data science, while also encouraging cooperation among members. With Mines and IISA as the primary organizers of the conference, the event promotes education and research in the Front Range area, fosters the exchange of information and scholarly activities among scientific institutions in the Front Range, Midwest, and across institutions in the United States. The conference website (https://www.intindstat.org/conference2023/index) provides up-to-date information and announcements regarding the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
