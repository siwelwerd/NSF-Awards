 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI) is an impactful network of 16 geographically and technically diverse shared nanotechnology facilities that enable scientists and engineers, who otherwise would not have access to a broad suite of nanotechnology equipment, to perform groundbreaking research.  Along with providing open-access to state-of-the-art nanotechnology facilities and expertise, the NNCI sites also collaborate to develop nanotechnology education, outreach, and workforce development programs.  In response to the ending of this National Science Foundation (NSF) award in 2025, the NNCI is organizing a \u201c2023 Workshop on Nanotechnology Infrastructure of the Future\u201d to gather the necessary information to recommend a strategic path forward for a shared national nanotechnology infrastructure resource for 2025 and beyond.  The hybrid, two-day workshop will feature invited talks, panel discussions with leaders from academia, industry, and government agencies, and brainstorming sessions focused on the following topics: (1) Setting the Stage for the Future of Nanotechnology Infrastructure, (2) Forecasting the Future: Nanotechnology 2035, (3) Catalyzing Nanotechnology Education for K-14, (4) Translating Nanotechnology from R&D to Market, (5) Reimagining Environmental and Social Sustainability, and (6) Measuring Success: Impact Analysis and Metrics.  The workshop will take place in September 2023 in Washington D.C. and online to enable easier access for a broad audience, since all U.S. stakeholders in nanotechnology and related fields will be welcome.  Through active participation, the workshop attendees will identify technological trends, significant gaps in our existing technical capabilities and education, and prudent solutions that align the needs of the various stakeholders. The outcome of the workshop will be a public-facing outcomes report recommending a path forward for the next iteration of a national nanotechnology infrastructure resource.\r\n\r\nMany academic institutions, small companies, and non-profit organizations cannot afford to own and maintain the diverse portfolio of scientific equipment needed to develop new technology.  Since 1977, the NSF has supported some incarnation of a network of well-equipped, open-access laboratories located at various universities across the country.  Researchers from outside of the host universities can gain entry to the laboratories after being properly trained to use the relevant equipment.  Access to cutting-edge scientific equipment has empowered low-resource scientists and engineers to perform transformative research which has resulted in many impactful inventions and entrepreneurial ventures. Equally important, these networks have fostered communities that are passionate about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education and outreach and thereby enable learners at all levels to grow and succeed.  The current open-access laboratory network, called the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI), is funded until 2025.  To help make recommendations for the next open-access laboratory resource, workshop participants will explore the anticipated needs of researchers and educators and will brainstorm approaches to best meet these needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
