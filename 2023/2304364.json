 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance the understanding of the scientific foundation needed to realize a new type of laser diodes based on an emerging class of semiconductor called metal halide perovskites. Perovskites are deposited from solution, meaning that they can be fabricated on virtually any substrates, where traditional laser diodes are difficult or even not possible to grow. Furthermore, there is currently a deficiency in the performance of laser diodes in the green, known colloquially as the \u201cgreen gap\u201d. Perovskite can emit light efficiently throughout the visible spectral region, holding the potential to address the \u201cgreen gap\u201d. The research will strengthen technological leadership of the U.S. and prepare the next generation of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) graduates, including women and underrepresented groups, to follow a STEM career. This project will incorporate outreach activities for the purpose of disseminating this research to K-12 students.\r\n\r\nA grand challenge within the metal halide perovskite research community is to demonstrate a non-epitaxial, electrically pumped perovskite laser diode. Overcoming this challenge will not only facilitate scientific understandings of the unique material properties of perovskite semiconductors, but also deliver a new class of laser diodes with continuous wavelength tunability and the ability to be integrated on a broad range of substrates where III-V semiconductor growth is difficult or even not possible. However, there are several major obstacles that must be surmounted to achieve this goal, such as a deeper understanding of the gain characteristics under electrical pumping, and how to achieve appreciable levels of current injection required for lasing while managing significant emission-quenching processes. Our proposed research seeks to overcome these obstacles and demonstrate an electrically pumped, spin polarized perovskite laser diode. This demonstration will be accompanied by a deep understanding of the optical gain characteristics and charge carrier recombination processes in these materials. From this improved understanding, tailored strategies for device optimization can be developed. This project will have a great impact on less well-developed aspects of halide perovskite optoelectronic applications, such as optical communications integrated on-chip.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Electronic, Photonic, and Magnetic Devices (EPMD) Program of the Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems Division (ECCS) Division , and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
