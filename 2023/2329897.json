 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamics of the Earth\u2019s inner magnetosphere, and particularly the outer radiation belts, are highly affected by wave-particle interactions. In these interactions, certain electromagnetic wave modes can accelerate electrons up to relativistic energies, while other are responsible for relativistic electron precipitation into the atmosphere. The work will investigate this process, which is important for predicting space weather effects on space craft. Early career researchers and students will be supported.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this award is to investigate conjoint electronmagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) and whistler wave effects on electron dynamics in the Earth's inner magnetosphere. The methodology involves the use of statistical observations of EMIC and whistler waves from the Van Allen Probes, the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms mission, and Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission spacecraft to construct a new empirical model of EMIC and whistler wave observations and quantify, analytically and numerically, the resultant electron scattering rates. Simulation results, based on the estimated scattering rates, will be validated by comparing with the observed evolution of electron fluxes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
