 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phytoplankton are microscopic, single-celled organisms that play an important role in the Earth?s ecosystems, elemental cycles, and climate. These organisms, which live in surface ocean waters, require sunlight and nutrients to grow and reproduce. In the oceans around Antarctica, nitrate (NO3-) as a nutrient source of nitrogen (N) is usually abundant while the nutrient iron is often sparse. Light availability also changes from complete darkness to 24 hours of constant sunlight, as well as from low light deeper in the water column to high, stressful light at the ocean surface. As a consequence, the phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean often live in a suboptimal environment in which conditions for growth are frequently changing. Scientists understand that nutrient supply and light availability affect these organisms and that these organisms, in turn, can alter the chemical composition of the seawater. For example, nitrate can occur in different forms, including a lighter (14N) and heavier (15N) form of NO3-, depending on which stable isotope of N is present in the molecule. Phytoplankton prefer to use the lighter isotope during uptake and incorporation into biomass, though the ratio of 15N/14N used by phytoplankton has been shown to vary depending on environmental conditions. Notably, the isotope ratio used by phytoplankton is recorded in sediments and can be used to determine both the historic composition of ocean waters and the productivity of phytoplankton. This project will test the hypothesis that enhanced light and/or iron stress change the isotopic ratios of water column nitrate- in specific ways. A combination of laboratory culture and field experiments will be conducted. Cultures of important Southern Ocean phytoplankton species will be grown under environmentally-relevant light and iron conditions where ratio of 15N/14N used by phytoplankton, physiological changes, and molecular markers of iron and light stress and nitrate assimilation will be measured. Similar measurements will be done in shipboard experiments on a cruise in the Southern Ocean with South African colleagues. These data will increase our understanding of past and present productivity in the Southern Ocean, and how phytoplankton changed the chemical composition of the seawater. Undergraduates from underrepresented groups in the STEM field and graduate students from Florida State University and Old Dominion University as well as students from South Africa will collaborate on this project. The improved process understanding of the N isotope effect will be presented not only at scientific national and international conferences but also during local outreach events at local K12 schools.\r\n\r\nInterpretation of both modern water column nitrate (NO3-) isotopic ratio (d15N) measurements generated by GEOTRACES and other cruises, as well as metrics of paleo-nutrient utilization, depend upon a mechanistic understanding of the degree to which NO3- assimilation by phytoplankton discriminates against the heavier isotope, 15NO3- (NO3- assimilation epsilon). We currently lack the ability to predict how iron and light stress impacts the NO3- assimilation epsilon. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that enhanced light and/or iron stress elevates the epsilon for NO3-assimilation. This hypothesis will be tested by a combination of laboratory culture work and field work on a cruise of opportunity in the Southern Ocean. Mesocosm experiments will include both increasing and alleviating light and/or iron stress on monoclonal phytoplankton cultures and in natural phytoplankton communities while measuring the response of the NO3- assimilation epsilon. Water column samples will be collected on the cruise for analysis of dissolved and size-fractionated particulate N concentration and d15N, as well as phytoplankton community composition, photophysiology and gene expression markers of iron and light stress and NO3- assimilation. In particular, the expression of iron and light stress markers will be used to evaluate the relative contribution of iron and light stress to field-based estimates of the NO3-- assimilation epsilon. The results from these field measurements, together with lab-based culture studies, will be used to constrain the range of the epsilon for NO3- assimilation under environmentally-relevant light and iron conditions, including the potential alleviation of iron stress as has been hypothesized to have occurred during the last glacial maximum (a.k.a. the Martin hypothesis).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Phytoplankton can also alter the chemical composition of seawater. For example, the ratio of light (14N) to heavy (15N) nitrogen that phytoplankton uptake changes due to environmental conditions. Understanding how this ratio varies impacts our interpretation of current and past water column nutrient inventories and productivity. This project was part of a broader project to test the hypothesis that enhanced light and/or Fe stress leads to a higher isotope fractionation for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>assimilation, which was evaluated using a combination of laboratory culture work as well as field work in the Southern Ocean. &nbsp;This portion of the larger project evaluated the phytoplankton community composition (via amplicon sequencing) and gene expression (meta-transcriptomics) from near-surface water samples and from two Fe/light mesocosm experiments. Transcriptomes from laboratory culture experiments under varying Fe and light were also analyzed.</p>\n<p>In total 3 manipulative microcosms were run in which communities were acclimated to different light conditions (15m and 50m light intensity and different light spectra (as calculated from CTD data). Iron conditions were manipulated by adding 2 nM Fe to the Fe replete communities and 0.5 nM DFB (Fe chelator to reduce Fe concentrations). A control incubation was run without Fe manipulation and light conditions as found in mixed layer. Treatments were done in triplicate except in the 3<sup>rd</sup> mesocosm experiment.&nbsp; Chlorophyll growth and photophysiology of the ship-board experiments indicate 2 successful acclimation experiments, one initiated on the Sub-Antarctic Zone side of the Sub Antarctic Front (SAF), one in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ). These data also indicate Fe and light co-limitation in the SAF communities and Fe limitation but no light limitation in the MIZ communities (Fig. 1). Unfortunately, the third mesocosm experiment had to be cut short before successful acclimation. Additionally, genetic analysis samples were taken from the underway system every 1-4 hours on the South-bound leg (64 &ldquo;stations&rdquo;) and from the surface and chlorophyll maximum from 16 CTD deployments conducted along the ice edge and on the Northbound cruise transect.</p>\n<p>RNA and DNA were co-extracted from the SAF and MIZ incubations as well as most surface and CTD transect samples.&nbsp; DNA was amplified using both 16S and 18S primers, sent for high-throughput sequencing, and analyzed for phytoplankton community composition. &nbsp;A comparison of amplicon sequencing analysis and Cytosense imaging (from Dr. Lumi Haraguchi) from the SAF incubation supports the hypothesis that 16S chloroplast is a better metric for relative abundance of phytoplankton groups and 18S is a better metric to assess the relative biomass of phytoplankton groups (Figure 2). &nbsp;Regardless of which amplicon sequencing method was used, samples from the SAF incubation statistically significantly grouped together based on both iron status (control, DFB, +Fe) and light status (high or low), though correlations were higher with 16S than 18S (Figure 3 A&amp;B). In the MIZ incubation, there was less separation of phytoplankton community composition between light treatments than between Fe treatments (Figure 3 C), which is consistent with the observed chlorophyll response suggesting light limitation was not a driving factor in the MIZ, but Fe was (Figure 1). Analysis of phytoplankton communities from the transect indicate that stations grouped roughly by front/zone location (Figure 4 A). Community composition shifts correlated with changes in physical (salinity &amp; temperature) and chemical (macronutrient concentration) parameters (Figure 4 B).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>RNA extracted from the SAF and MIZ incubations, 10 surface samples from the northbound CTD transect, and 3 laboratory culture experiments was sent for poly-A selection RNA sequencing.&nbsp; As we only received sequencing data in the final 6 months of the project, we are still in the process of analyzing these metatranscriptomes (field) and transcriptomes (lab).&nbsp; Initial analysis being conducted to test the bioinformatic pipeline has focused on the SAF incubation, specifically the DFB (Fe removed) and +Fe high light treatments. &nbsp;Upregulation of canonical Fe stress markers in the DFB treatment transcriptomes (Figure 5 A &amp;B) show that Fe stress did occur in this treatment. An interesting result that is being considered further is that silica transporters were upregulated in the +Fe high light treatments (Figure 5 C), suggesting the community was either Fe/light/silicate co-limited, which has been suggested to occur later in the season for sub-Antarctic diatom communities, or that alleviation of Fe stress drove the community into secondary silicate limitation, which has previously been observed in the North Pacific high nitrate low chlorophyll region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/27/2023<br>\nModified by: Phoebe&nbsp;Chappell</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2333913/2333913_10592852_1701098115693_OutcomesFig2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2333913/2333913_10592852_1701098115693_OutcomesFig2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Fig. 2.
