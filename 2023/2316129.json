 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel award supports U.S. student and early career scientist participation in the 21st INQUA Congress, which will be held in Rome, Italy, on July 14-20, 2023. The INQUA Congress presents scientists from around the world with the quadrennial opportunity to present their original research and discuss the latest developments across a wide range of Quaternary disciplines. The USNC/INQUA will competitively award at least 10 travel fellowships at up to $2,000 each for U.S. citizens or permanent resident graduate students and early career scientists working on Quaternary research at U.S. institutions presenting papers as first authors at the 21st INQUA Congress and organize mentoring activities for the cohort before and during the Congress. The travel award selection process will aim at increasing the active participation of those who have been traditionally underserved and underrepresented in the Earth sciences and support a diverse spectrum of participants from multiple institutions.\r\n\r\nThe critical and interrelated goals of this program are to advance the careers, enable new collaboration opportunities, and increase the visibility of young U.S. students and early career Quaternary scientists who would not be able to otherwise attend this Congress. Helping awardees present their research at the INQUA Congress gives them the opportunity to learn about cutting-edge research and hear comments about their research from people trained in other parts of the world. These exchanges can also foster collaborations with members of the travel award cohort and/or with international scientists, interactions that will, in turn, serve to advance U.S. Quaternary science. This travel award is co-funded by the Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics Program, the Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology Program, and the P4CLIMATE Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
