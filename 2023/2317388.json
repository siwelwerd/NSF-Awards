 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides a workshop  \u201cCyber Physical Systems (CPS) Rising Stars\u201d to be held at the University of Virginia.  The purpose of the workshop is to identify and mentor outstanding Ph.D. students and postdocs who are interested in pursuing academic careers in CPS areas. This workshop gives participants a chance to gain insights about navigating the early stages of careers in academia, as well as provide networking opportunities with faculty and peers, opening the door for on-going collaboration and professional support for years to come. The workshop includes a program committee comprised of faculty with extensive background in CPS who will select students for the workshop. One workshop aims to increase representation and diversity in CPS, by encouraging applications from women,underrepresented minorities (URM), and persons with disabilities. A specific effort is also being made to recruit workshop participants who may be at non-R1 schools.\r\n\r\nThis will be the second CPS Rising Stars Workshop.  This workshop will be modeled after the first including a variety of sessions designed to build a cadre of researchers in CPS and foster future collaborations amongst the students in the field.  The first Rising Star workshop was successful in recruiting a high percentage of URM students.  This workshop will retain this recruiting focus in addition to paying special attention to selection of non-R1 candidates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
