 "awd_abstract_narration": "Real-time embedded systems (RTES) are ubiquitous and pervasive in everyday life worldwide, currently found in numerous applications ranging from smart phones to intelligent cars and air/spacecraft. The increased number of devices that use RTES, in conjunction with the demand for ever greater performance, call for improved energy management solutions to stem energy consumption without sacrificing performance. On the other hand, fault tolerance has also been a major concern in pervasive and ubiquitous computing platforms. The proposed project will develop new energy management algorithms for RTES while satisfying the fault tolerance requirement. The findings will radically shift how RTES are designed to be able to meet performance demands on a \u201cgreen and highly dependable\u201d computing platform. As such, the results of this work can also have an enormous global impact not only on the industry\u2019s financial gains, but also on the environment\u2019s health. Furthermore, this project integrates research and education by providing undergraduate and graduate researchers with hands-on unique research experiences where they can apply theoretical learning and can inspire them to explore a career in computer science. Finally, this work intends to lay the groundwork for future technological advances which can increase the competitive edge of this country while also providing societal benefits.\r\n\r\nIn this project, a novel scheduling framework will be designed to improve the performance of highly dependable real-time embedded systems (RTES) under fault tolerance requirements, exploiting modern power-management features available in heterogeneous multi-core processors. Three Specific Aims will be addressed: (1) to develop novel energy management schemes that can reduce energy consumption for real-time embedded systems (RTES) under fault tolerance requirement; (2) to develop algorithms that can create a scheduling framework targeting maximizing the feasibility of fault tolerant RTES under hard energy budget constraint; and (3) to extend this scheduling framework to many-core platforms. The novelty of the project lies in the fact that it combines the three critical dimensions of RTES design, i.e., energy efficiency, fault tolerance, and Quality of Service (QoS) into a single, unified framework to reduce energy consumption as well as to maximize the feasibility while satisfying the QoS for RTES from the system level.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
