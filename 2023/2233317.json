 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project entails the development of a simple and affordable saliva-based test that will enable the detection of early Alzheimer's disease. Today, there is no single test that can determine if a person has Alzheimer's disease. Because the diagnosis is complex, invasive, and expensive, these tests are only performed once symptoms, such as memory loss, begin to manifest. These symptoms of Alzheimer's disease only become apparent once the disease has already cause significant damage to the brain. The proposed test will be widely accessible and detect the disease before symptoms arise, enabling the patient to start active prevention strategies and even therapies to preserve brain health. As the American population ages \u2014 nearly 1 in 4 Americans will be 65 years of age or older by 2060 \u2014 Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other dementias are becoming a great challenge for health and social care. As part of a broad approach to prevention, this technology can potentially extend early Alzheimer\u2019s care to millions of Americans, allowing interventions, monitoring, and treatment initiation years earlier than what is currently possible.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is applying sophisticated chemical analysis methods to develop a novel test to detect signs of early Alzheimer\u2019s disease using a person\u2019s saliva. Diseases can cause changes in the biochemical composition of body fluids such as blood or saliva. Using a modern, highly sensitive type of spectroscopy based on light scattering, and combining it with advanced statistical approaches (i.e., machine learning), this project is developing a method that can reliably detect biochemical changes in saliva specific to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by showing its ability to distinguish saliva donated by healthy individuals from saliva collected from Alzheimer's patients at both mild and moderate stages of the disease. The project will also investigate whether known biomarkers for Alzheimer\u2019s disease are being identified by this method and develop statistical approaches to interpret spectroscopic data.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The advantages of EAD's novel approach are (1) no need for hypothesizing a potential biomarker(s) and (2) potentially probing the contribution of several biomarkers simultaneously. Although our method does not allow for identifying new biomarkers, it may be able to detect known biomarkers earlier than currently possible and non-invasively. In Phase I, we generated tentative assignments of the most critical regions of the saliva Raman spectrum for discriminating between AD, mild cognitive impairment, and normative classes and developed, trained, and tested a machine learning algorithm for classifying saliva samples as coming from a normative or Alzheimer's disease donor. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to identify regions of interest in the saliva spectra where differences are observed between groups. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was used as a classification technique. The overall sensitivity of the ANN network in differentiating both classes was around 87%, with a precision-recall F1 score well above 86% for both classes, with only a few individual spectra misclassified.To verify the model's performance, external validation was conducted using six samples collected later, including AD donors with moderate AD and mild AD with a cognitive score very close to healthy individuals, to see if the model is fit for early detection. The external validation dataset was only introduced to the ANN network after the training was finished, and the samples are unknown to the model and have never been introduced before. The model predicted the class probability for each individual spectrum from the collected map of approximately 40 spectra per sample. All external validation spectra of the six donor samples were assigned to the class with the highest probability. Five of the six donors were correctly classified, culminating in an accuracy rate of 83% for sample-level predictions derived from the ANN model. The integration of Raman hyperspectroscopy with the ANN model thus offers a sensitive and noninvasive diagnostic approach. It captures the complexity of disease biomarkers in saliva while providing high specificity and sensitivity for early detection of Alzheime's disease. This approach enhances diagnostic accuracy and reinforces saliva's viability as a practical medium for early-stage, noninvasive AD screening.EAD's work has the potential to offer significant broader impacts and benefits to society, due to its potential to advance the health and welfare of the American public. It also has the potential to benefit the American economy as it supports the prevention of AD, a disease that causes a significant burden in the U.S. healthcare system, in addition to the human suffering it perpetrates. AD affects 6.2 million Americans and is the 7th leading cause of death in the U.S. AD pathology may arise up to 20 years before the onset of dementia, providing a unique window of opportunity for interventions aimed at preserving cognitive health and delaying disease progression. Once AD becomes clinically obvious, treatment is more difficult. Many treatments, such as monoclonal antibodies, are much more effective the earlier the treatment is started. Thus, early detection before cognitive impairments would increase the potential for patient independence and delay functional side effects of AD. Thus, identifying at-risk patients requires sensitive tests that are widely accessible, affordable, and minimally invasive and thus able to reach a large, asymptomatic population. EAD's saliva-based screening tool for detecting early and preclinical AD aims to fulfill this need, based on Raman Spectroscopy combined with machine learning (ML) algorithms trained to detect AD-related signature changes based on the total contributions of multiple biomarkers. By 2060, nearly one in four Americans will be 65 years or older, and the number of individuals aged 85 and older is expected to triple. Additionally, the country will see an increase of half a million centenarians. This growth in the older adult population could lead to heightened demands for healthcare services, in-home caregiving, and assisted living facilities. To address these challenges, a comprehensive approach to prevention will be necessary. This will include education, the promotion of healthy lifestyles, fostering cognitive resilience, and identifying individuals at risk for neurodegenerative diseases. Targeted prevention measures, as well as potential disease-modifying therapies, can then be initiated before significant neurodegeneration occurs.
