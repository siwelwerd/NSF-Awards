 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes creating radioisotope materials which can be used for high performance power production decay batteries used in deep space, medical applications, unmanned drones, and other uses. These materials will be able to provide electrical power for months or years at a time enabling game changing technologies by enabling ubiquitous and readily available nuclear power to become a reality. Not only can this technology be used for power, but the specific isotopes produced can also support efforts to fight cancer, perform medical imaging, and explore natural resources. According to Allied Market Research, nuclear driven battery markets are expected to reach $87.2 billion by 2026.The unique capabilities of radioisotopes can provide many benefits in many different areas, but their rarity often limits their use. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project seeks to generate a power-producing radioisotope material from a naturally-occurring source and show that it can be used for power in a long-lived nuclear battery.  The technical hurdles for this project include being able to use radioisotopes not currently considered for decay batteries and generating useful amounts of radioisotopes for an attractive cost. In order to overcome these hurdles, a functioning prototype will be constructed and driven with isotopes made at NPPR to empirically show feasibility. This will be accomplished by demonstrating the ability to induce radioactive decay in the feedstock, collecting the radioisotope produced, and showing its use in a power source. With the developments made in this project, radioisotopes will be more readily available. Medical, aerospace, defense, and many other markets will see great opportunities for advancement with the newly available materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nNu Planet Pharmaceutical Radioisotopes Inc. (NPPR) demonstrated the feasibility of a Low-Cost Isotope Battery (LCIB) for long-lived application in medical devices, remote locations and space batteries. The LCIB uses charged particles emitted by radioactive decay to produce electricity through P-N junctions. P-N junction conversion of alpha particle emitting isotopes has been developed by several researchers in the past but utility has been limited by the unavailability of high power density radioisotopes.\n\n\nThe novel Nanoparticle Induced Alpha Decay (NIAD) provess developed by NPPR involves the application of ultra-high energy, short-pulsed lasers whose quick energy deposition significantly increases available power output enough to induce decay allowing for generation (up to 150% of original population) and collection of non-traditional alpha-emitting isotopes. The chemical separation process using column chromatography was optimized for collection of the desired isotopes with an efficiency rate of 90%. All isotopes were surrogates of the Uranium-235 decay chain which decays into Actinium-227. These surrogates have the same elements and will behave the same as the Uranium-235 decay chain. These non-traditional isotopes demonstrated energy conversion with P-N junctions to provide measurable power output.\n\n\nThe market, cost, and feasibility of at-scale production was investigated. Customer discovery interviews narrowed the commercialization goals to space power outside of Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) due to re-entry applications that do not allow for radioisotope use and rapid technological advancements that do not require long-life power. Missions beyond LEO may include stealth satellites, polar mining on the Moon, asteroid belt mining, and solar system exploration missions. A desire for customizable battery shape and size was identified.\n\n\nThe improvement to this technology by NPPR uses the NIAD process of generating non-traditional radioisotopes affordably. The production of non-traditional isotopes also provides a new approach of customizing the battery for the mission (rather than the mission fitting into current battery capabilities). The shorter half-lives also mean higher specific power (i.e. more compact, lower mass sources requiring less space). This will significantly expand the supply chain of the nuclear battery market, opening the door for new applications beyond LEO. Additionally, the new isotope power sources will have lower gamma fields greatly reducing safety concerns and shielding needs.\n\n\nFurthermore, the LCIB is also capable of providing small-scale consistent power to small electronics such as pacemakers and computer chips. Creating an alternative low-cost electric power source which can operate for years without charging would expand remote applications, including space exploration, environmental monitoring, deep ocean research, and medical uses. In addition to increasing the competitive position of the United States in this market, this technology may contribute to Homeland Security efforts of defending U.S. assets in space.\n\n\nBy making this low-cost, long-lived isotope battery readily available and usable in a broad range of temperatures, this transformative technology will expand current applications for nuclear batteries in space, as well as terrestrial applications.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/15/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KirstenAAdams\n"
