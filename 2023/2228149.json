 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a novel solution for air filter monitoring that will have a positive impact on public health, the environment, and the US economy. The technology is based upon the direct measurement of the filter status using photosensors, smart signal processing algorithms for accurate filter soiling condition determination using the sensor data, and the Internet of Things (IoT) for control and communication. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), \"Ambient air pollution kills about 3 million people annually... About 90 percent of the world's population is exposed to levels exceeding WHO limits.\" While air-filtration technology alone cannot solve the overwhelming problem of ambient air pollution, it must be an integral part of a comprehensive solution. With data driven decision making to eliminate premature filter replacement and to reduce costs, the proposed technology will propel the usage of high-quality filters more ubiquitously, leading to enhanced public health. With 150 million heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in operation, and quarterly filter replacement, an estimated 600 million filters are manufactured and thrown away every year. A reduction of 50% of the filter waste will have a significant positive impact on the environment because of reduced manufacturing and waste.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will leverage the accuracy of photosensors in detecting the degree of filter blockage by sensing transmitted light through the filter. Underlying the seemingly straightforward solution is a set of complex technical challenges. Due to the uneven structure including pleats and frame obstructions, the sensor data are inherently noisy. A software-controlled actuator will place the sensor in front of the filter and take data from multiple locations of the filter. A smart algorithm will be developed to extract a parameter from the analysis of the data set that would be an accurate proxy for the particle size removal efficiency defined in the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers standard which in turn is expected to be a sufficiently accurate indicator of the true filter age. Using the IoT capability, the sensor data will be collected in the cloud, where the smart algorithm and control software will be stored. The final objective is to determine the optimum point for filter replacement by comparing the parameter with a threshold parameter derived from a predetermined maximum particle size removal efficiency and airflow resistance based on indoor air quality requirements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While air filtration alone may not solve issues with indoor air pollution, it plays a critical role in reducing harmful particle exposure indoors, where we spend ~90% of our time. Despite filter replacement being a key component of good indoor air quality, it is still largely guesswork based on a relatively arbitrary schedule and is not driven by objective data or by performance-based protocol.</p>\n<p>To address this problem, Lumiaq has devised a breakthrough optical sensor-based smart filter monitoring technology, protected by two U.S. patents (10,864,471 and 11,235,272). With the support of its partners, Lumiaq successfully demonstrated the technical feasibility of this system through the development and lab-testing of a prototype and associated cloud computing pipeline which enables data collection and analysis.</p>\n<p>Light absorption and scattering by aerosol particles have been extensively studied not just for their effect on the radiative balance of the Earth's atmosphere and consequently on the climate, but also for characterizing the contamination of oceanic water. Despite the vast and rich literature on atmospheric aerosol and oceanic hydrosol characterization using light attenuation, the technique has not been applied to monitor dust particles deposited on HVAC filters. The primary reasons are the high cost of <em>in-situ</em> measurements of dust accumulation on a commercial filter using atmospheric aerosol characterization techniques, and the complexity of the characterization of dust particles deposited on the irregular surface of a HVAC filter. Consequently, there is neither a commercial monitoring system nor an academic system that can accurately detect <em>in-situ</em> the soil loading on an air filter using optical techniques.</p>\n<p>The issue of the fluctuation of the light attenuation depending on the location of the filter has been solved by mounting the light source and sensor pair on an arm connected to a servo motor. This allows the source sensor pair to move across the filter, take attenuation measurements across many locations, and calculate an average of the attenuation data. Three averaging algorithms were tested: simple, weighted, and Monte Carlo. Surprisingly, the simple average proved to be highly effective, though there are plans for further research with larger datasets to explore potential improvements with the weighted and Monte Carlo techniques.</p>\n<p>Notably, to the company's knowledge, this is the first known instance where a spectral dependency of light attenuation has been used to characterize particle size distribution of soil on a filter.
