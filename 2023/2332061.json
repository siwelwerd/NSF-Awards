 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will conduct exploratory research to pursue an opportunity arising from the Journal Editors Discussion Interface (JEDI) group of repositories previously launched from the Data Preservation Alliance for the Social Sciences (Data-PASS).  JEDI\u2019s main focus is on the aspects of the editorial process that concern data and code and their management, citation, and accessibility; additional aspects of research transparency; and reproducibility, replication, and verification. JEDI provides a mechanism for journal editors to interact with each other and with other stakeholders in the academic ecosystem. Editors can pool their collective experience, and make their hard-won expertise available to their successors and other new editors.  \r\n\r\nJEDI has hosted numerous discussion threads on Open Science (OS) and journal editing. Drawing on information and materials provided in these discussions by its members, JEDI has begun to compile a substantial collection of OS resources. While the network\u2019s editor-centered approach has been strikingly successful, it has also demonstrated the need for exploratory research to prepare JEDI to take a more directed approach to its resource collection. The project will draw from existing OS taxonomies to map the individual elements of OS, and how they connect (and are sometimes in tension) with one another. The team will curate an account of OS which, while reflecting mainstream views of the topic, is framed for the needs and interests of journal editors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
