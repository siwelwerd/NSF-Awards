 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ICSA 2023 China Conference: Data Science with Applications to Big Data Analysis and AI will be held in Chengdu, China, on June 30-July 3, 2023. This award is used to provide travel support to the USA participants of this conference, who will deliver invited talks or give poster presentations. This conference is the annual conference of the International Chinese Statistical Association (ICSA), which provides statisticians and data scientists with an excellent opportunity to meet, interact, network and collaborations in the research. The main goal of the conference is to promote education, research in statistics and biostatistics, and provide a forum for leading experts, junior researchers, and practitioners to discuss big data analysis, machine learning, AI, and the integration with data science. The conference also provides a unique opportunity for the exchange of statistical research activities and development of data science between different countries. The financial support to graduate students, early-career researchers, and underrepresented researchers from the USA can help them to exchange ideas about new frontiers in statistics research with numerous outstanding researchers all over the world during the conference.\r\n\r\nThe conference maintains a very strong and comprehensive program, which includes two keynote speeches, over 160 invited talk sessions, junior researcher award session, and contributed poster presentations. The conference organizers strive to enhance the diversity of speakers and maintain the high quality of presentations. Moreover, the conference features a panel discussion on \"New Generation of Statisticians in Drug Development\", which is about the career development for junior statisticians. For students and junior researchers, the conference will provide other great opportunities such as junior researcher awards and poster sessions. The details about the conference can be found on the website https://maths.swjtu.edu.cn/english/ICSA_2023_China_Conference.htm.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
