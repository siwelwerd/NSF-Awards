 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nRecent advances in acoustics, have revealed topological acoustics (TA) possess extraordinary properties such as extreme resistance to disorder and obstructions such that TA waves can be transmitted in domains that are non-homogeneous and contain obstructions without generating echoes or reflections. Based on these unique properties and recent work published in peer-reviewed U.S. and international journals, the New Frontiers of Sound (NewFoS) Science and Technology Center (STC) is tackling multiple exemplar grand challenges using TA. These grand challenge avenues of investigation are 1) contributing to U.S. global competitiveness in the scientific arena of quantum information science, 2) significantly impacting the future of wireless communication and 3) applying TA to bypass remote sensing limitations in the physical world at scale. The NewFoS STC is advancing understanding of the innate characteristics and properties of TA as well as its potential applications. The NewFoS STC is broadening understanding of acoustics by supporting research that uses TA to make new or better technologies in both traditional and non-traditional acoustics applications as well as generating educational materials and paradigms that will inform the next generation of TA learners and practitioners.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWithin use-inspired topological acoustics (TA) research and context-based education, the New Frontiers of Sound (NewFoS) Science and Technology Center (STC) is advancing knowledge by: (a) revealing and understanding the scientific laws governing the untapped hidden attributes of TA waves; (b) enabling the convergence of multiple disciplines to exploit the full attributes of TA waves while advancing their technological applications; and (c) creating context-based resources for education within the framework of a Mentoring Ecosystem to drive equity and empower new usage of TA. NewFoS is using the untapped attributes of geometric phase, coherence, and robustness as resources to address two types of high-impact integrative activities: (a) problem-driven projects which rely on TA approaches to achieve unique solutions to today\u2019s grand challenges in information science, telecommunication, sensing, and imaging; and (b) possibility-driven research approaches where TA is the engine driving unrealized possibilities to fruition. NewFoS is ensuring US leadership in a coherence-based complementary approach to quantum technology that does not suffer from some of the challenges of current quantum systems. This STC is also developing the first operational, low-cost, miniaturized, low-power functional TA radio-frequency device that exploits robustness for advanced telecommunications. Furthermore, this NewFoS STC is surpassing current limits of remote sensing technologies to continuously monitor the natural environment using TA. The NewFoS STC is additionally a national resource for convergent research and education in TA and its applications. This STC is engaging multiple research and educational perspectives to solve scientific challenges surrounding TA including, but not limited to, mathematics; materials science; physics; mechanical, electrical, and civil engineering; as well as environmental, geological, medical, and information/data sciences. By engaging industry, this STC is also ensuring the effective translation of TA-based scientific breakthroughs into new technologies. NewFoS is also developing the pedagogical and TA-based resources needed for the next generation of acoustic education by generating the first in-print and digital English-language TA textbook, a community college research workshop, and a curriculum-design seminar course for students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
