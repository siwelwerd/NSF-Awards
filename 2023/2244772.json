 "awd_abstract_narration": "Movement is an essential characteristic of living organisms that affects ecological and evolutionary dynamics from the scale of single individuals to entire ecosystems. As such, Movement Ecology has emerged as a dynamic, new field of research dedicated to understanding the different forms of animal movement, its ecological and evolutionary causes and consequences across taxonomic groups, and its implications for conservation and management. The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Movement Ecology of Animals is the only international forum for researchers in this burgeoning field of research. The GRC format focuses on the presentation of cutting-edge, unpublished research in a stimulating and cooperative environment, aiming to promote dialogue and facilitate networking among scientists at all career stages. Funding from the NSF will help broaden participation at the 2023 GRC on the Movement Ecology of Animals by directly supporting the attendance of early career researchers, members of historically underrepresented groups, and those serving in undergraduate or minority-serving institutions. \r\nThe 2023 GRC on the Movement Ecology of Animals is entitled \u201cProximate and Ultimate Drivers of Animal Movement\u201d. Following this theme, invited presentations will define the different ecological and evolutionary drivers of animal movement and consider its diverse consequences for individuals, populations, and communities. This theme is particularly timely given the current rate of rapid global change and society\u2019s reflections on how we can, and should, respond to it. The GRC will also be held in conjunction with a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) focused on the theme \u201cTheory and Hypothesis-Testing in the Movement Ecology\u201d. The GRS is a 2-day meeting preceding the conference organized for and by Early-Career Researchers (ECRs) to present new, unpublished research and discuss cutting-edge ideas amongst peers in a welcoming and stimulating environment. NSF funding will enable us to achieve three major goals of the joint meetings: 1) broaden participation of diverse groups (in terms of race, gender, career stage, and institution), 2) expand mentorship opportunities for ECRs, and 3) develop new professional relationships to synthesize and stimulate research emerging from the meeting to the broader scientific community. As such, this NSF award will enhance the scientific and professional development of a more diverse group of researchers who would otherwise most likely not be able to attend.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
