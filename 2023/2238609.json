 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human languages are staggeringly diverse, and yet children around the world display some striking similarities in the process of language learning. It is important to identify similarities that occur across diverse learning contexts because such similarities provide evidence for the evolutionary basis of language - what makes humans (but not other animals) capable of learning human languages. And yet diversity among languages and cultures implies that human infants must considerably adapt their language behaviors to their home environments. This CAREER project investigates how consistencies in learning are flexibly adapted in context by examining early word learning in two unrelated languages. The findings contribute to the development of detailed theories of child language learning that apply to children from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds in educational and clinical settings. The project advances the training of the next generation of scholars to conduct comparative cross-linguistic research and creates educational resources for use by the community and the general public.\r\n\r\nAcross multiple languages, children\u2019s first words are more likely to refer to objects than actions, a cross-linguistic similarity that is colloquially called the \u201cnoun bias\u201d. This project investigates the source and strength of this bias across a highly noun-centric language and culture and a more verb-centric language and culture. The results shed light on what experiences make children more or less likely to focus on nouns and noun-like words during early development. On the one hand, a language itself can be structured in a way that points children\u2019s attention to nouns. On the other hand, the ways that adults communicate with children may also point their attention to nouns. By using a comparative cross-linguistic approach that includes spontaneous conversation, eye tracking, and tests of new word learning, this research pinpoints the nature of the noun bias and deepens understanding of how it is adapted for the specific language and culture of a child\u2019s home environment. The findings yield insight into a key part of the evolutionary basis for language: how children are biased to understand and label the world around them.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
