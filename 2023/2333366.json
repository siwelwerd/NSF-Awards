 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for U.S. based participants of the summer school \"Renormalization and Visualization for packing, billiards and surfaces\", to take place from 10 - 14 July 2023 at the Centre International de Rencontres Math\u00e9matiques, in Luminy, France. The goal of this summer school is to develop a diverse generation of researchers who can take this circle of results further, and to extend them to new domains. In particular, by bringing together researchers in multiple fields, the organizers expect to see new and interesting impacts at the intersection of mathematics, computation, and visualization. \r\n\r\nThe summer school will be centered on three minicourses, on the theme of renormalization in geometry, number theory, and dynamics respectively. Renormalization involves rescaling dynamical, geometric, or number theoretic phenomenon to observe behaviors at multiple scales, and renormalization ideas have led to striking visual and computational phenomena and uncovered new connections between seemingly disparate areas of mathematics. The circle of ideas being explored in this research school includes problems motivated by physics, for example, the classical Newtonian mechanics of billiards in two and three dimensions, as well as the geometry and number theory of circle packings. The interactions between mathematics, computation, and visualization are expected to produce interesting pieces of open-source software and striking visuals which can be shared amongst the mathematics community for both research and educational purposes. The conference website is https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/2794.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
