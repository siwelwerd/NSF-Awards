 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a small plasma confinement device called an orbitron, which could have applications to allow low cost, highly mobile fusion sources. Markets with the largest opportunity to benefit from small, carbon-free, micro-fusion reactors are the \u201chard-to-decarbonize\u201d industries like long haul trucking, maritime shipping, aviation, distributed energy, and also space power and propulsion.  The development of a small clean energy fusion reactor would be a transformative technology for society.  The proposed micro-fusion device may enable continuous clean energy production from readily available elements, without the use of long-term radioactive elements.  This microfusion device is also expected to be orders of magnitude cheaper than larger scale fusion reactors, and will allow for iterative design and testing for optimization.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project will result in the ability to achieve predictions of the fusion gain factor (Q) for orbitron-based micro-fusion reactors. Orbitron science combines aspects of electrostatic ion traps, like an Orbitrap, with high voltage microwave-type electron confinement in \u201ccrossed-fields\u201d like a Magnetron.  The resulting plasma regime is novel and exhibits very high ion and electron energies, moderate densities, and long particle confinement times.  Optimized fusion gain factor modelling will be achieved via systematic anchoring and validation of Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code via experimental measurements.  Discrete experiments with small orbitron fusion reactors will be used to assess the various plasma loss mechanisms. These mechanisms include ionization between fuel ions and neutral background atoms, particle scattering collisions to the device walls and Bremsstrahlung X-ray radiation losses. Once these mechanisms are correlated with the PIC code, detailed assessments of the simulated fusion plasma will be made to determine the potential Q of a future small-scale fusion reactor for energy production.  This gain in understanding will enable development of solutions to mitigate loss mechanisms in future prototypes to maximize Q for small net energy fusion devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nTo explore high fusion rates in a compact volume, Avalanche Energy has developed a hybrid magnetic and inertial electrostatic confinement fusion device called an Orbitron. The Orbitron is a crossed-field device combining aspects of magnetic mirrors, magnetrons, and orbital ion traps. Ions are confined in orbits around a high voltage cathode at fusion relevant energies with co-rotating electrons confined by a relatively weak magnetic field. Single particle confinement physics of the Orbitron device along with particle-in-cell simulations of a quasi-neutral plasma show particle confinement and co-confinement behavior key to desirable plasma conditions.\n\n\nThe objective of this Phase I NSF Grant was to improve our scientific understanding of the Orbitron's potential for a net energy device via simulation and tests. Experiments with the Orbitron fusion reactors were conducted to assess confinement behavior and loss mechanisms. These include ionization between fuel ions and a neutral fixed background, Coulomb particle scattering, electron confinement and Bremsstrahlung losses for electrons. Assessments of the simulated fusion plasma to determine the potential Q of a future small-scale fusion reactor were completed with the WarpX particle in cell code (PIC) and a 0-D model.\n\n\nTo characterize the loss of the high-energy ions due to particle scattering and charge exchange with the neutral background gas, we measured the decay of deuterium ions loaded into the Orbitron at various background neutral deuterium pressures. We obtained the relative population of ions from ion image current following shut-off of the ion source for a range of background pressures. A volumetric loss rate was measured for deuterium ions loaded under these conditions.\n\n\nTo characterize the electron plasma confinement and density we developed and tested a microwave interferometer diagnostic. Density measurements with the microwave interferometer setup of a pure electron plasma were successfully collected. The density is relatively constant as the electron loading current is varied over an order-of-magnitude, which suggests that a density limit has been achieved. This density limit is within a factor of two from that predicted by PIC simulations of this device. To our knowledge, these constitute the first microwave interferometer measurements of a pure electron plasma.\n\n\nAn inherent energy loss mechanism of this device is Bremsstrahlung radiation, which is a commonly-cited concern for fusion reactors with non-Maxwellian energy distributions. The broad x-ray spectrum shows that our signal is dominated by x-ray line emission from high-energy electrons colliding with the argon background gas and also line emission from the stainless steel anodes producing the chromium, iron, and nickel lines.\n\n\nMethods for measuring properties of fusion neutrons, including energy and location of production, were studied to help distinguish beam-beam from beam-target fusion. Production of 2.45 MeV neutrons resulting from deuterium-deuterium fusion was observed using bubble detectors and a pulse shape discriminating scintillator system. Additionally, a neutron camera diagnostic has demonstrated the capability to measure the spatial origin of neutrons for Orbitron operating conditions.\n\n\nWarpX was used to simulate the Orbitron, but not all of the needed physics routines have yet been implemented. Therefore, two lower-fidelity models were used to evaluate the dispersion relation for the diocotron mode and to do an implicit solve of the equation of motion for a single particle in the Orbitron vacuum field. The simple dispersion model was used to identify the dominant unstable mode in electron plasmas in the Orbitron as the diocotron mode.\n\n\nFusion power gain and losses due to Coulomb collisions and Bremsstrahlung for the unique Orbitron physics were explored using a 0-D model and target plasma parameters have been identified. In addition, hybrid beam-Maxwellian particle energy distributions, so called \"Chacon plasmas\", were identified as potential routes for reduced Coulomb collision rates vs pure beam-beam plasmas and thus a possible route to a Q greater than 1 Orbitron.\n\n\nThis R&D improved our understanding of the fundamental operating constraints of the Orbitron fusion reactor, advancing the knowledge and understanding within Avalanche Energy and across the fusion community. This is crucial to enable successful development of the Orbitron fusion reactor.\n\n\nThe commercial introduction of a compact, carbon-free high specific energy (W-hr/kg) power source would be a transformative technology development akin to the invention of the airplane or the smartphone. Avalanches goal is to play a significant role in eliminating carbon emissions from the mobility and distributed energy sectors. The high specific energy of a micro-fusion reactor is also significantly greater than what is achievable with hydrocarbons. This would be an enabler for new applications such as undersea vehicles for research and resource extraction, long duration air mobility vehicles and commercial space travel beyond LEO.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RobinLangtry\n"
