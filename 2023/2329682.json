 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the wearable device market. The customer discovery process will provide critical data to determine the wireless charging needs for medical professionals, patients, nurses, first responders, and other users who may use wearable devices. The wearable market is expected to be $58B by 2022.  Specifically, the technology will impact patients and the most marginalized groups such as the elderly and infants by providng wireless charging to their body-worn devices. It will also allow military/defense personnel to stay on duty while their body-worn communication devices and tactical gear are continuously charged. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project will advance an innovative wearable technology approach combining textile-based radio-frequency (RF) modules and antennas for power harvesting. Implementation into a smart charging platform provides power transmission via novel antenna topology and power management circuitry suitable for the charging needs of wearable, medical, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The proposed anchor-shaped antenna allows misalignment-resilient power transfer for body wearable charging solutions. Combination of the anchor antenna and high efficiency rectifier circuit provides a seamless power collection and transmission method integrated into the upholstery of surfaces (e.g. chair, couch, bedding).  This system will charge gadgets, medical, or military equipment and enable communication while charging through daily life activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The technology provide a continuous charging of wearable devices for its users using antenna and charging circuitry which are directly integrated into textiles. The potential usecase of the technology as medical device was identified and verified based on 105 interviews with potential consumers, including in-hospital medical personnel, such as nurses, biomedical technicians, out-patients, and nursing home personnel over the course of this project. The product market-fit investigations resulted in three value propositions which were formulated from these interviews. The value propositions put forward by this technology were&nbsp; (1) the technology offered a more convenient charging solution for patients than traditrioanl plug-on charging, (2) an undisturbed mobility is enabled by the device while charging, and (3) device offers a convenience of continuous and universal wireless charging. Table 1 (attached as an Image) summarizes specific classfications related applications of this technology as perceived by the members of the medical community. The team continued the customer discovery process by interviewing CEO of hospitals, key industry partners, and people from alliance purchasing groups. From the interviews, the highest percentage of agreements (96%) came from doctors/nurses, biomedical technicians, and patients. The team then narrowed our customer segments down to in-hospital medical personnel (nurses, biomedical technicians, etc.), out-patients, and nursing home personnel. Based on this, the team formulated the customer ecosystem as shown in Figure 1 (see primary image). From these interviews, the conclusions reelated to need of these devices were formulated.&nbsp; (1) Patients in medication, need to know their vitals all the time, so there is need to continuously power their monitoring devices (2) Wireless charging would eliminate sentinel events (heart attack erythema, cardiac arrest)-telemetry device runs out of charge. The project supported the professional development of one faculty member and two graduate Ph.D. students. The opportunities for professsional development were generated and used via travel to on-site locations for interviews, and conferences,&nbsp; and exposure with the members of medical community in industry and academia. Two patents were awarded through this project. In addition, 4 major publications spun out by the support of students participating in this project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 08/28/2024<br>\nModified by: Shubhendu&nbsp;Bhardwaj</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2329682/2329682_10718024_1724873608169_Fig_1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2329682/2329682_10718024_1724873608169_Fig_1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2329682/2329682_10718024_1724873608169_Fig_1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Customer ecosystem developed through this project</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shubhendu Bhardwaj and Dieff Vital</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shubhendu&nbsp;Bhardwaj\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2329682/2329682_10718024_1724873366771_Table_1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2329682/2329682_10718024_1724873366771_Table_1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Table-1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2329682/2329682_10718024_1724873366771_Table_1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Table-1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summary of outcomes from interviews</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shubhendu Bhardwaj and Dieff Vital</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shubhendu&nbsp;Bhardwaj\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Table-1</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
