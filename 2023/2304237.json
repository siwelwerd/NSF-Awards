 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes the commercialization of synthetic materials that reproduce the structures and functions of mucus gels. Nature deploys mucus to address a wide range of soft material needs, including as lubricants, adhesives, and barriers, and natural mucus is currently being investigated for filling many of these same roles in consumer products. The synthetic mucins can impact various markets including skincare, dermatology, healthcare, and materials industries. Furthermore, synthetic analogs of mucins can advance the scientific frontiers through a better understanding of the role of mucus in digestive, respiratory, and immune systems. The societal impacts of this project include the national economic benefits resulting from being the first to bring to market an entirely new class of biomimetic materials. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to address technical hurdles related to the sustainable scalability, biocompatibility, and tailorability of synthetic mucus biomaterials. The current commercial manufacturers of natural mucus directly harvest the mucin biomaterials from animal mucus. Such a practice poses challenges related to purity, scalability, and reproducibility, which preclude its incorporation into many of the envisioned applications. To overcome the challenges, this project designed a synthetic mucin prototype and seeks to achieve the following goals: i) reconfigure the chemical process to reduce costs, production time, and environmental impact; ii) understand the tolerance of epithelial cells to these synthetic mucins; and iii) demonstrate a relationship between the chemical structure and material properties of synthetic mucins so they can be tailored to meet particular customer demands. Taken together, these efforts will remove many of the major barriers to the commercial viability of synthetic mucins.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
