 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in a series of three conferences on commutative algebra, KUMUNU 2023-25, which will be held at the University of Missouri\u2019s Columbia campus, one each in the Fall of 2023, 2024, and 2025. The first of these will be held September 23 - 24, 2023; exact dates for the remaining two are to be determined.  KUMUNU (which is named for its original participating institutions (the University of Kansas, the University of Missouri\u2013Columbia, and the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln) is an annual conference (held since 1999) for commutative algebraists in the Great Plains region and attracts participants from a significantly larger geographical region. Invited speakers for KUMUNU 2023 include David Eisenbud (University of California, Berkeley), Jakub Witaszek (Princeton University) and Laura Matusevich (Texas A&M University). The conference will also include talks by early career researchers and a poster session for junior researchers.  Members from the local graduate student community will be actively involved in coordinating the poster sessions and other activities promoting a sense of community amongst students and young researchers. The conferences will provide opportunities for early-career mathematicians to showcase their work and introduce promising graduate students to the research community. \r\n\r\nThe KUMUNU conferences aim to advance mathematics through research talks on current and the most influential research by a mixture of prominent and experienced mathematicians as well as budding and talented researchers and students. More specifically, the conferences will promote connections between commutative algebra and other areas by inviting speakers who are expert on a broad range of subjects connected to commutative algebra.\r\n\r\nMore details are available at the conference website:  http://www.math.missouri.edu/kumunu-2023.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
