 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experience in ALpine Meteorology (REALM) relies on the natural scientific laboratory of the Wasatch Mountains and adjacent urban areas, to enhance student awareness of societal challenges. Environmental challenges confronting society such as water availability and air quality, require understanding the influence of alpine terrain on weather and climate processes. The Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Utah is a leading program for weather and climate education and research in the Intermountain West and is recognized internationally for its expertise in atmospheric studies related to mountain environments, including: measurement, analysis and prediction of orographic precipitation; fire weather applications; and air quality.  The department has a rich history of involving undergraduate students in research. Following the models used by successful REU programs on the University of Utah campus and at other institutions, REALM has developed a cohesive framework to manage a high-quality, cohort-based undergraduate summer program. Every summer, eight undergraduate students will spend ten weeks on campus at the University of Utah, and at field sites in Utah and Colorado, where they will have an immersive research experience. REALM includes an independent qualitative and quantitative evaluation to ensure the project goals are being met and a sustainable model for future REU programs is being developed.  \r\n\r\nThe objectives for REALM are to:  1. engage students in full-time active research; 2. provide professional development opportunities for students and mentors; 3. motivate students towards STEM careers by constructing an engaging, inclusive, and supportive cohort experience that includes exposing them through site visits to employment opportunities in the weather, water, and climate enterprise; and 4. improve students\u2019 science literacy and oral and written communication skills.  REALM is designed to welcome and support students historically underrepresented in STEM in a highly inclusive environment.  REALM applications from minority serving and 2-year institutions are recruited via targeted faculty visits and the utilization of preexisting networks. The REALM program also aims to recruit first-generation college students. To create an inclusive and supportive environment, each participant will interact with a mentoring team that includes: 1. a faculty advisor, required to complete training on practices for successful mentoring, who will suggest a research topic relevant to the interests and skills of undergraduate students; 2. a communication mentor for guidance with both oral and written communication, that culminates in the final poster presentation; 3. a programming mentor to provide students with coding skills necessary to complete their projects; 4. a student peer mentor from within the cohort; 5. the REALM Mentorship Council that will meet bi-monthly with all REU students to encourage their educational and professional development.  After the summer experience, students will have the opportunity to present their research at a national scientific conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
