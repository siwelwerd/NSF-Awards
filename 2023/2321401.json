 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project -- Setting Up Research Foundations Multiple Organization Regional OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (SURF-MORe-OFFN) -- connects Mid-America Christian University, Northwestern Oklahoma State University, Oklahoma State University Biomedical Imaging Center, Rose State College and Western Oklahoma State College to the OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (OFFN). SURF-MORe-OFFN enables a wide-range of research and education activities in cybersecurity, natural science, biomedical engineering, nursing and STEM-related fields that meet workforce needs. Faculty and students across the state will have access to new research and education opportunities through the enhanced cyberinfrastructure resources. SURF-MORe-OFFN leverages existing statewide partnerships to provide students access to researchers and cyberinfrastructure practitioners, creating substantial collaboration opportunities. Collectively these institutions educate a diverse student population including Hispanic, military, first-generation, and adult learners as well as traditional students who transfer to four-year universities.\r\n\r\nSURF-MORe-OFFN extends the OneOklahoma Friction Free Network to under-resourced campuses and a biomedical research center by implementing Science DMZs, Data Transfer Nodes and network performance monitoring capabilities to support research and education drivers. SURF-MORe-OFFN engages technical personnel at each campus to facilitate adoption of new technology and provide access to network infrastructure, computing tools and scientific equipment. The project also engages faculty and students in the larger OneOklahoma CyberInfrastructure Initiative (OneOCII), which enhances research computing throughout Oklahoma. OFFN is managed by OneNet, Oklahoma\u2019s research and education network.  Scientific leadership is provided by the University of Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
