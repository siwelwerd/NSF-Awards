 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is in developing an innovative solar power solution using carbon-based perovskite solar cell technology. The primary focus of the project is to address the challenges associated with stability, scalability, and commercial viability of low-cost carbon electrode-based perovskite solar modules. Through a combination of cutting-edge research, advanced manufacturing techniques, and strategic partnerships, the project aims to accelerate the availability of such solar modules in the market. By harnessing the power of these materials, this project seeks to unlock new possibilities for solar energy generation and make it more accessible to a wider audience. The project team will undertake extensive research to enhance the efficiency and stability of these solar modules. This project will explore novel materials and solar module design approaches to maximize power conversion efficiency and ensure long-term performance. This project represents a significant step towards a sustainable and clean energy future. The graduate students and postdoctoral researchers involved in the project will gain entrepreneurial education and explore the commercialization pathway for the newly developed technology.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project aims to develop carbon-based perovskite solar cells and modules through a scalable solution-based blade coating approach. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce production time, cost, and weight. By tailoring the interface and surface passivation during the coating process, the project expects to improve the quality, uniformity, stability, and reliability of large-scale blade-coated perovskite thin films. The conductivity of the carbon electrode will be optimized by adjusting its composition, resulting in increased efficiency. Engineered interfaces between the carbon and perovskite layers will facilitate more efficient carrier transport. The project will also focus on optimizing the module design by manipulating laser scribing on the carbon electrode. Through large-scale manufacturing demonstrations, the project will showcase the feasibility of commercial production. Additionally, long-term stability testing will be conducted to validate the durability and reliability of the carbon-based perovskite solar modules. Overall, this project aims to significantly improve the performance, efficiency, and reliability of carbon-based perovskite solar technology, making it a viable and sustainable option for the renewable energy industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
