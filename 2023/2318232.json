 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), in collaboration with the CSTA chapters in Wisconsin and New Jersey, the CSTA Black Affinity Group, and WestEd, will implement Scaling MENTORS in CS (Matching Experienced and Novice Teachers for Ongoing Rigorous Support in Computer Science), a CSforAll High School Strand research-practice partnership to expand and iteratively improve a peer mentorship program to provide ongoing, rigorous, and job-embedded support to high school teachers who are new to teaching computer science (CS). While novice teachers often require more intensive support to be effective, there are relatively few opportunities for ongoing professional development and support in CS. In this project, experienced CS teachers will guide novice CS teachers in setting, monitoring progress toward, and meeting individualized growth goals to strengthen their teaching practices and their ability to effectively serve students traditionally underrepresented in CS, particularly African American and Hispanic students and students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. This project will reach 152 CS teachers in three years, impacting approximately 18,240 students.\r\n\r\nKey project activities involve recruiting and matching teachers in mentoring partnerships; training mentors and hosting regular community of practice meetings; holding frequent mentoring meetings; and using research and evaluation data to iteratively improve the program and outcomes. The Scaling MENTORS IN CS partners expect the following project outcomes: (1) growth in CS teaching knowledge and confidence in teaching CS, as measured by surveys, interviews, mentor evaluations, and self-reflections; (2) growth in mentoring skills, as measured by surveys, interviews, and focus groups; (3) increased use of equitable and inclusive teaching practices, as measured by surveys, interviews, and mentor evaluations; and (4) increased commitment to CS teaching, as measured by surveys and interviews. This project scales the MENTORS in CS program to two new communities, while learning how to adjust program structures to meet varying sociocultural and educational contexts. With success, the team supported by this grant intends to apply for a future Large-sized proposal to scale far more broadly across CSTA\u2019s growing network of 100+ regional chapters and affinity groups, ultimately reaching thousands of teachers across the United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
