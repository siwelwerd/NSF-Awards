 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a significant step towards resolving the access vs. privacy dilemma of the big data era. The use of people\u2019s biometrics, internet traffic, and financial, medical, and genetic data can enable better crime prevention, targeted ads, and health innovation, but at the expense of privacy. Data may also be too sensitive to be given to third parties. The immediate impact of adopting this technology will be greater security for sensitive image data with easier access to useful inferences. The solution will shift the paradigm of institutions storing sensitive data onsite to one in which even sensitive data is stored and accessed in the cloud. With the capability of private outsourced data analysis will come a marketplace for computational tasks, including machine learning as a service, that will spur research and deliver better results to patients and clients faster and without risk of exposure.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will adapt existing Deep Neural Network models to use a fully homomorphic encryption scheme to perform image classification on encrypted images. The primary challenge is to reduce the computational overhead of operations on encrypted data to make the scheme practical at desired levels of accuracy and security. The proposed research and development addresses this challenge through innovation in machine learning, computational number theory, approximation theory, and computer science. The goal of the proposed research and development is to demonstrate the commercial viability of secure image recognition by achieving a reasonable level of security, accuracy, and server cost. The team will experiment in training and testing modified convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification using carefully chosen activation functions and/or approximations to the testing function, and simultaneously building onto existing homomorphic encryption libraries new functionality to compute these operations homomorphically.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
