 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neurodivergent youth, including those with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, possess cognitive assets that underlie core mechanisms for STEM innovation. However, neurodivergent youth often do not have access to learning environments in which they can reflect on their cognitive strengths and identify them as offering critical skills and valuable contributions to the future STEM workforce and to society. To increase access to this type of learning environment, this project will develop and test a suite of materials for makerspaces, including curricula and facilitator guides, called NeuroVivid. NeuroVivid will provide neurodiverse youth with opportunities to build simple electroencephalogram (EEG) headsets using low-cost and widely available materials; to view and interpret data related to their brain activity; and to interact with these data in playful ways. As examples, youth can use sensor data to play music, control robots, or operate simple machines. Within this context, neurodivergent youth will learn about neuroscience with a focus on neuroplasticity and cognitive assets. NeuroVivid will be iteratively co-developed and tested with makerspace facilitators and with approximately 85 racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse and neurodivergent youth (age 10 to 14). Research will explore which design elements are essential for brain-computer interface (BCI) learning materials that enhance neurodivergent youths\u2019 interest in STEM, with a particular focus on their interest in BCI careers. This empirical research, as well as the NeuroVivid materials, will be disseminated widely through makerspace networks as well as through educational research venues. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.\r\n\r\nThis project will result in a suite of maker curricula and materials, titled NeuroVivid, intended to counter deficit models of cognitive differences through highlighting the cognitive assets of neurodivergent youth. Youth will be selected to co-develop and use these materials, as they work collaboratively with the project team and with makerspace facilitators, if they score in the bottom quartile on an amalgamation of the following four tasks related to executive functioning: n-back task (associated with working memory); flanker task (associated with visual attention); go/no-go task (associated with inhibition control); and a card sort task (associated with cognitive flexibility). The research team will use mixed methods research to identify the design elements that are essential to BCI learning materials that build interest in STEM among neurodivergent learners. This research will also explore how intersections of race/ethnicity, gender, and neurodivergence affect the development of interests and identities in STEM in the context of this curriculum. To achieve these research purposes, a neurodiverse project team will generate data sources such as transcripts from interviews and focus groups from racially and ethnically diverse youth who participate in NeuroVivid. Pre- and post-surveys that measure STEM interests and identities will also provide indicators as to NeuroVivid\u2019s effectiveness among neurodivergent youth. NeuroVivid will be disseminated widely through digital platforms and conferences used or attended by makerspace personnel. Ultimately, this project will advance practice in makerspaces through generating knowledge about how these spaces can more explicitly affirm a broader range of cognitive strengths, while increasing neurodivergent youths\u2019 interest in STEM careers of the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
