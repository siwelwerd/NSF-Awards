 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to William Marsh Rice University, located in Houston, TX, will support the training of 10 students each year for 10 weeks during the summers of 2023-2025. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities and/or members of under-represented groups, with an emphasis on students enrolled at proximal minority-serving institutions, including community colleges and four-year institutions, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Students will conduct research in interdisciplinary projects, guided by mentors from various science and engineering disciplines. At the end of the program, students will have a better understanding of how biological networks work. Assessment of the program will be done thru the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program to monitor their career paths. NSF ETAP system will be used to register participants (https://www.nsfetap.gov/).\r\n\r\nThis REU program will expose students to the contributions made by different science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines toward the detailed understanding of living systems as integrated networks. Students will work in laboratories that draw from an array of approaches - from classical biochemistry and genetics to complex theoretical modeling. Research areas include: (i) biomolecular structure, function, and evolution, (ii) naturally-occurring genetic networks, (iii) synthetic biology and metabolic networks, and (iv) ecological networks. Participating faculty mentors will be from a range of departments including the Biosciences, Bioengineering, Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Chemistry, and Computer Science. Students will also participate in workshops focusing on ethics and the responsible conduct of research, professional communication, the graduate school application process, and more. Application to the program will require a transcript, resume, research statement, and two letters of recommendation. Participants will be selected by a faculty committee, which will assess student alignment with the program based on demonstrated excellence in STEM coursework and interest in research. More information about the program is available by visiting https://ibb.rice.edu/nsf-reu-bionetworks or by contacting the PI (Dr. Kirienko at kirienko@rice.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Silberg at joff@rice.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
