 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) Workshop is an annual event with the goal of encouraging participation of graduate students and junior researchers in integer programming and related areas. The primary goals of the Workshop are to showcase young researchers; to increase the visibility for accomplished students at an early stage in their career; and to provide an opportunity for graduate students to network with the world's top researchers. MIP student poster sessions provide students with an opportunity to highlight their ongoing work and network with other researchers from industry and academia. During the workshop, student posters are also judged by a workshop committee and outstanding posters are recognized. In addition, the workshop features a computational competition that will allow students to test their skills on a challenging optimization problem. This award provides travel support for 10 student poster presenters for each three workshops held between 2023 and 2025. The event has been a fertile ground for students' professional development, with a number of previous participants supported by NSF now holding faculty positions across the US.\r\n\r\nThe MIP Workshops are held annually at locations across the United States.  The 2023 MIP Workshop will be held in Los Angeles, California, from May 22-25. The solicitation for travel support will be sent to a variety of mailing lists, with particular effort to broaden participation by attracting students from underrepresented groups in engineering. By providing travel funds for graduate students, NSF will help to decrease the cost of attendance to encourage participation of students and will support the engagement of STEM students in emerging research in the field of MIP.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
