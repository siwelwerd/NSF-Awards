 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the continuation of the Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Science (SOARS) program over the next three years. SOARS is a well-established and evaluated undergraduate-to-graduate bridge program designed to broaden participation in the atmospheric and related sciences. The program is a student-centered, social learning model that includes research, mentoring, community, and multi-year ongoing support for historically marginalized students in STEM, called Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. SOARS has proven to be effective in supporting talented diverse students to enter and succeed in graduate school, post-secondary pathways, and beyond.  There remains a strong need for the SOARS program, as the percentage of underrepresented communities in the atmospheric and related sciences remain far below those of the majority population. The work proposed for the next three years includes continually maintaining a large cadre of mentors who support the SOARS mission, enjoy institutional support from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, the University Community Programs, and partnering laboratories; and continue to engage a strong alumni network. The program will be preparing Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s for leadership as the next generation of leaders in the Earth System Sciences, through comprehensive mentoring and guidance. SOARS will support 15 students over 11 weeks during the summer months. Over this time, professional development will take place to include technical writing, communication, computer software classroom instruction, conducting research, and oral presentation of research results.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
