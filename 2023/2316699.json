 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Rosa Maria (Padi) Fuster Aguilera is awarded a National Science Foundation Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (NSF MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research, education, and activities related to broadening participation by groups underrepresented in STEM. This fellowship supports the research project entitled \"Fluid Equations and Chemotaxis on Manifolds\". The project activities will be conducted at the host institution, University of Colorado Boulder, under the mentorship of Dr. Magdalena Czubak.\r\n \r\nThis project includes research on two related topics in partial differential equations (PDE) and differential geometry. The first one is the search for an intrinsic viscosity operator on a general Riemannian manifold which is of great importance for understanding the appropriate formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations on curved manifolds. The second one is the study of the qualitative behavior of solutions for a PDE model for chemotaxis in curved manifolds with an application to tumor growth in organs. The broadening participation activities for this project include \"Meet a Mathematician\" and the \"Math For All\" conference. Meet a Mathematician is a collection of video interviews of mathematicians from diverse backgrounds where their personal stories as well as the mathematical research that they do is highlighted with the aim of providing role models for students. Math For All is a nationwide mathematical conference featuring speakers from diverse backgrounds with the main goal of creating a friendly and welcoming environment to discuss mathematics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
