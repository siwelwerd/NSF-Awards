 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Augmented Learning for Environmental Robotics Technologies (ALERT) aims to serve the national interest by developing and testing an Augmented Reality (AR) learning platform for Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) students to prepare them for working with environmental data and robotics. ALERT will be designed to address the training needs of the AEC industry, which is expected to face disruptions due to robotic automation. ALERT will leverage advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), AR, and information technologies to create immersive, interactive, and data driven environmental robotic learning environments. It will integrate an AI-powered intelligent learning systems with AR to collect and analyze learner performance data to customize learning experiences and improve learning outcomes. ALERT will also develop a novel interdisciplinary curriculum focusing on environmental monitoring and data visualization for sustainable building design and construction. \r\n\r\nThe project will address the need to prepare the AEC students to capture, analyze, and apply environmental data in order to reduce the impacts of human development and construction. It will also address the shortage of a skilled workforce in the AEC industry, focusing on the sustainability of the built environment. ALERT will provide a technology-rich learning experience, which will enhance students' competitiveness for future jobs. By developing and testing ALERT at Florida International University, one of the largest majority-minority student populations, the project will take advantage of a unique opportunity to create a curriculum tailored to diverse learners. Project results will be disseminated through various channels including webinars, press releases, publications, and presentations in a variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary venues. The project team plans to utilize social media as a vehicle to communicate with interested students and educators. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
