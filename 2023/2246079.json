 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by building consensus for a united vision of undergraduate computing education around the areas of inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessible learning. The goal of this project is to move the needle on several of computing\u2019s biggest challenges in undergraduate programs. Examples of challenges include how to manage booming enrollments in computing without damaging diversity efforts and how to widen a domestic path to PhD programs. Computing education continues to face challenges around inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessible learning. While several departments and colleges are achieving major successes in these areas, many others are lagging. Change is possible with a coordinated effort among computing department leaders and faculty. All universities and colleges need to \u201cLEVEL UP\u201d and implement the best practices that broaden participation in computing. \r\n\r\nTo achieve the goal of developing consensus on a shared vision of change, a series of regional workshops will be held where faculty across the country will meet and build consensus around inclusive computing education. The project will utilize an equity lens and involve several NSF BPC Alliances and BPC community members. The results of the workshops will be compiled, summarized, and disseminated nationwide in an evidence-based report of best practices towards inclusive computing. This project will involve faculty from diverse institutions, representatives of the NSF Broadening Participation in Computing Alliances, and an advisory board of highly respected computing educators and professionals. The advisory board will coordinate the creation of the final report.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
