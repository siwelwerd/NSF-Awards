 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the treatment and cognitive function of epilepsy patients by using eye-tracking measurements to detect neurocognitive symptoms associated with epilepsy as well as the side effects of anti-epilepsy drugs. Epilepsy results in an estimated $28 billion in direct costs annually in the United States, in addition to hurting the quality of life of patients and their caregivers.  Eye tracking technology, paired with cognition monitoring modules, will have a positive economic and societal impact. For example, some patients with epilepsy may be able to return to work sooner and the burden on caregivers to monitor seizures and side effects may be reduced. Earlier identification of comorbidities can enable simple interventions, such as additional support in classrooms, to improve long term outcomes. In addition, the technology will help clinicians diagnose and refer drug-resistant patients to specialized epilepsy centers much sooner than the current average of 18 years. Finally, the solution will improve side effect monitoring in clinical trials for new antiepileptic drugs and help optimize dose recommendations. These advances will, in turn, accelerate the development of new anti-epileptic therapies. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to improve the lives of epilepsy patients by using passive observation of eye movements in a naturalistic setting to objectively and reliably identify seizures and monitor neurocognitive symptoms and drug side effects. The proposed solution will use a wearable device to collect eye movement data over time and this data will be analyzed to quantify changes associated with impairments in cognitive functions such as attention and reading speed. This data then will be used to develop a personalized therapy response profile to assist clinicians in managing epilepsy. The goal of this project is to collect non-seizure, spontaneous eye movement data and develop algorithms that provide insight into clinical features, including the improvement or worsening of symptoms and possible antiepileptic drug side effects. The outcome of this research will enable a fully powered, pivotal study to be designed and carried out to compare passive eye tracking data to the gold standard neuropsychiatric assessments for the treatment of na\u00efve absence epilepsy patients over time and as medication adjustments are made.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
