 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER grant funds the research activities of Professor Vera Gluscevic at the University of Southern California (USC).\r\n\r\nThe research of Professor Gluscevic focuses on enabling the discovery of cosmological dark matter. Dark matter comprises 85 percent of the matter in the universe, and thereby governs the evolution and dynamics of galaxies.  However, it cannot be explained by any known particles or forces. Professor Gluscevic will combine the available empirical evidence --- in particular, observations of the universe on both small and large scales --- with fundamental theory and novel computational methods, in order to identify the forces that govern the dark matter and uncover its origins.  The knowledge generated in this program will advance the national interest by promoting the progress of fundamental science and by generating a novel understanding of matter and physical reality itself.  This program will also directly create research opportunities for underrepresented minorities in astronomy and physics and involve training of 8 junior scholars, including 5 undergraduate members of the National Society of Black Physicists. Their training will involve contributions to the proposed research and emphasize computation and data analysis, preparing them for careers in research. Professor Gluscevic will also help to promote student retention and bolster the sense of belonging for physics majors, through a new course on programming and data literacy at USC. The associated activities will create a blueprint for an interactive and inclusive physics classroom and help to diversify the workforce in STEM.\r\n\r\nMore technically, this project aims to enable new methods for fast prediction of dark matter effects on galactic substructure.  It will also begin the first exploration of cosmological concordance in light of dark matter interactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
