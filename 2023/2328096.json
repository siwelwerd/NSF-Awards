 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description\r\n\r\nPhysicists and engineers have discovered many new optical phenomena in structured materials, such as negative refraction and nontrivial topology of light. Put simply, in nano photonics, structure determines function. In particular, 3-dimensional (3D) photonic structures have exciting potential for new computing paradigms. However, realizing their potential has proven challenging. Hero demonstrations of 3D structured photonic devices have been achieved using stacking or self-assembly. These approaches lack design flexibility or cannot be scaled up for production. This project focuses on advancing the design and fabrication of 3D photonic structures using a novel manufacturing platform: Field Assisted Nano Assembly System (FANAS). This platform uses thermal and acoustic fields to guide droplets to precise locations, building 3D photonic structures with submicron resolution. Successful implementation of FANAS will result in a Future Manufacturing system capable of producing novel 3D nano photonic structures reproducibly at scale. This project will enable new opportunities for fast optics platforms, impacting the multi-billion-dollar quantum computing industry. Investigators will integrate research with outreach programs such as Women in Science & Engineering (WiSE) program at the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison to promote diversity and inclusion. The project will also partner with the Wisconsin MRSEC Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) to recruit and work with students from underrepresented groups. This project will also enrich the investigators\u2019 outreach to K-12 students through an Engineering Expo Day hosted by their institution. Finally, the team will launch a series of research symposiums for workforce development and dissemination of research outcomes. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research (DMR) and  the Division of Electrical, Communications, and Cyber Systems (ECCS).\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nQuantum technology relies on photons as the carrier of the qubit. 3D photonics provides a new dimension to control light at small scale. Such control can enhance the ability in the storage, transfer, and transduction of photonic qubits. The overarching objective of this project is to investigate new design theorems and manufacturing principles for 3D photonics based on the physics of wave dynamics. In the FANAS system, acoustic-, electrohydrodynamics-, and thermal- fields are utilized to construct heterogeneous 3D structures designed for 3D photonics and quantum computing. These structures will be realized by developing methods to precisely place quantum dots and dye molecules in a 3D photonic structure. A new computational method will be developed to model the interaction between quantum emitters and complex 3D photonic structures. The multi-physics modeling will also advance the understanding of material interactions with the applied fields. The integration of multiple fields brings the versatility of the manufacturing method to an unprecedented level, since both the chemical and physical properties of the materials are exploited to achieve assembly and targeted performance. The field-assisted assembly platform enables: (1) assemble, alignment, and patterning of nanoparticles and nanomaterials at the micro/sub-micron scale, 2) precise droplet generation and flight behavior control, 3) manufacturing of complex 3D structures that could be scaled up using drop-on-demand concepts, and 4) novel device fabrication and demonstration via case studies for future broader applications in 3D photonics and quantum computing. This project lies at the intersection of two of the NSF\u2019s 10 Big Ideas \u2013 Growing Convergence Research and the United States Chips and Science Act.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
