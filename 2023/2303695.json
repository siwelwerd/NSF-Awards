 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virtual Tissues (VTs) are powerful computer simulations of cell behaviors within tissues and\r\norgans. They are a valuable resource and tool for researchers to delve into the mechanisms\r\ndriving both normal and diseased tissue behaviors. Although VTs do not replace traditional wetlab\r\nexperiments, they significantly contribute to the exploration and interpretation of existing data.\r\nThey enable researchers to conduct \"virtual\" experiments, offering guidance for additional\r\nlaboratory and clinical investigations. The combination of VTs with experiments leads to a deeper\r\ncomprehension of complex biological phenomena and bolsters the progress of scientific\r\nunderstanding. VTs play a crucial role in drug and therapy research, as well as in the creation of\r\nMedical Digital Twins for Personalized Medicine. Currently, there is a lack of infrastructure for\r\ncollaborative and progressive VT development. This limits their widespread adoption in biology\r\nand medicine. To address this limitation, this project aims to establish an active open-source\r\ncommunity providing resources and tools\u2014an ecosystem\u2014that fosters collaboration among\r\nresearchers from diverse backgrounds. By facilitating the sharing and application of biomedical\r\ndata and models, this project can transform VT development, accelerating biological and medical\r\nresearch and technological applications. Enhanced sharing and distribution of VTs will positively\r\nimpact STEM education because VTs present an excellent opportunity to accelerate learning of\r\nfundamental biological and medical principles in an accessible, appealing, and comprehensible\r\nmanner. By incorporating VTs into educational curricula, the project can expand the reach of\r\nSTEM education and inspire future generations of scientists and researchers. This work both\r\nexpedites scientific discovery and understanding of complex biological systems and also\r\nadvances American biotechnology and medicine. \r\n\r\nThis project will create OpenVT, an open-source, community-driven collection of resources,\r\nstandards and tools for expanding the use and adoption of multicellular virtual-tissue (VT)\r\ncomputer simulations of normal and diseased biological tissues. The OpenVT ecosystem will\r\ninitially unify and expand two existing widely used open-source platforms for building and running\r\nVT models, CompuCell3D, and PhysiCell. OpenVT will enable sharable, cross-platform modeling\r\ntools and shareable model specifications. OpenVT aims to accelerate the understanding of\r\ncomplex biological mechanisms related to tissue development, homeostasis, and disease. The\r\nproject will focus on agent-based modeling (ABM) approaches, where tissues and organs are\r\nconstructed using discrete cells, coupled with subcellular network models of signaling, gene\r\nregulation and metabolism and partial differential equations that simulate the extracellular\r\nmovement of oxygen, growth substrates, signaling factors, and therapeutic compounds. Specific\r\naims include: development of shared standards for specification of VT models between\r\nCompuCell3D and PhysiCell, creation of cell-type description libraries, standardization of initial\r\nconditions, and description of model outputs. These standards will then be used to define the\r\nneeded APIs that allow the interconnection and reuse of models and software components across\r\nthe two platforms, while also providing a concrete technical roadmap to support the integration of\r\nadditional open source ABM VT frameworks in the future. This approach allows for the integration\r\nof subcellular, cell-level, and tissue-level phenomena, providing explanatory power and enabling\r\nhigh-precision virtual experiments. The project will support the integration of other VT frameworks\r\nand the creation of educational and distribution facilities to enable their widespread adoption and\r\nextension of OpenVT. The OpenVT ecosystem aligns with successful community-driven initiatives\r\nin scientific software development, such as the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)\r\nproject. It aims to foster collaboration, establish standards for model inputs and outputs, and\r\nprovide user support and training. By transitioning to an open-source ecosystem, the project aims\r\nto reduce duplication of effort, promote software and modle sharing, and democratize access to\r\nmodeling capabilities. Project outcomes will be available at OpenVT.org.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
