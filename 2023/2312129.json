 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans are rapidly changing the planet by building cities. Populations of invasive species (i.e., species that have been introduced to an environment where they do not naturally occur) that live in cities may evolve in response to urban conditions in ways that may cause them to spread faster, become harder to control, and cause damage to agriculture and native plants and wildlife. However, it is not known if invasive species in cities tend to evolve in particular directions due to higher urban temperature gradients, or if other factors are more important, like the underlying genetic variability of populations, regardless of the environmental setting. This research will generate critical data on how and why cities affect the spread of invasive species. City planners and wildlife managers will be able to use the data to help prevent the spread of invasive species that negatively impact agriculture or other economically important activities. This project will also provide a variety of biology research experiences for high school and college students, including those from groups who are underrepresented in the sciences and thereby enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM.\r\n\r\nTwo outstanding questions regarding the evolutionary consequences of urbanization for invasive species range expansion require resolution: (1) How do evolutionary processes vary across the rural-urban mosaic? (2) How does standing genetic variation mediate evolutionary responses to urbanization? The researcher will use genomic sequencing of a rapidly spreading invasive species (spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula) as well as common garden experiments to build a mechanistic understanding of relationships between standing genetic variation and evolutionary responses to urbanization that affect species range expansions. Specifically, the researcher will use double-digest restriction site associated sequencing and low coverage whole genome sequencing to identify genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms of spotted lanternflies collected from rural and urban environments in the native range (China) and two invasive ranges (Japan and the United States of America). This research will also generate a chromosome-level genome assembly for the spotted lanternfly which will be compared with common garden experiments to look for signatures of adaptive evolution in rural and urban environments. Unprecedented insight into the role of urban environments in the spread of invasive species will be gained, with implications for invasive species management and risk assessment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
