 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solar cells are a very important class of renewable energy due to their cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and potential for integration into various applications. This planning grant seeks to establish and strengthen a collaborative partnership with Maryland Justice, Incorporated and develop strategies to engage black youth in the greater Baltimore area in hands-on training in renewable energy. This project, led by Coppin State University --- a historically black university, has potential to increase these students\u2019 appreciation of, participation in, and, consequently, representation in science-related careers. Nationally, Blacks are underrepresented in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The project seeks to have a profound impact on solar-based renewable energy technologies and its acceptance in communities underrepresented in STEM. The project will support the planning and initial development of innovative approaches that will ensure that the outcome of research in solar energy is effectively communicated to diverse groups of people. Project outcomes have potential to serve as a model for using social science and community involvement to promote research in technical science. The project\u2019s university-nonprofit collaboration will amplify its research findings. Maryland Justice Inc is an organization focused on promoting justice, equity, and social change among Black Americans, especially the families of those who have been incarcerated.\r\n\r\nThis planning grant will enhance the broader impacts of the planned research on improving the efficiency solar cells. The planning grant will offer the opportunity to develop research capacity, good grant writing skills, and strategies that can effectively disseminate products of the research to a wider audience and consequently generate a broader societal impact. Maryland Justice, Incorporated has a network of youth in high schools that will greatly benefit from the outcome of the research on the fabrication of solar cells. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their lower cost, flexibility, and ease of fabrication. However, DSSC has a lower energy conversion efficiency compared to conventional silicon solar cells due to the recombination of the generated photoexcited electron and other electron processes. Intended project outcomes include future preparation a full HBCU-EiR proposal and enhancement of the understanding of the interfacial transfer dynamics of electron transfer through Terahertz spectroscopy and Terahertz reflectometry imaging. The project's collaboration with Maryland Justice Inc will ensure a broader impact beyond the walls of the academic world, as challenges associated with the adoption of renewable energy will be addressed in a significant way.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
