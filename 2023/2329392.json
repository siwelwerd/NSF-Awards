 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 2023 offering of the Summer Geometry Initiative (SGI), to be held online July 10-August 18, 2023.  SGI is a six-week program supporting a cohort of undergraduates and early master's students in entering research in geometry processing.  In the first week of SGI, participants will attend hands-on tutorials introducing the theory and practice of geometry processing; no background or previous experience is necessary.  During the remaining weeks, participants will work in teams on research projects led by faculty and research scientists in this discipline, while attending talks and other sessions led by visiting researchers.  SGI aims to broaden the pool of students applying for PhD programs and employment related to geometry processing and applied mathematics more broadly; it has a long track record of increasing the size and diversity of the pool of new members of the community.\r\n\r\nGeometry processing has a long history of breakthrough developments that have guided design of 3D tools for computer vision, additive manufacturing, scientific computing, and other disciplines.  Algorithms for geometry processing combine ideas from disciplines including differential geometry, topology, physical simulation, statistics, and optimization.  The tutorials and research in SGI bring SGI Fellows and other participants up-to-date with state-of-the-art ideas in this emerging discipline and introduce them to leaders in the field with whom they collaborate on exploratory research projects.\r\n\r\nWebsite:  https://sgi.mit.edu/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nSupport from this grant was used to continue the Summer Geometry Initiative (SGI) in 2023, a summer program introducing undergraduates and early master's students to research in applied geometry.\n\n\nSGI 2023 took place during six weeks in summer 2023. The program supported a cohort of 32 SGI Fellows, who participated in the program full-time; an additional cohort of ~20 students were invited to participate in the initial week. The first week of the program featured a set of daily tutorials and interactive exercises intended to introduce participants to key theoretical concepts and software tools in geometry processing research, with no assumption on past experience in the field (beyond basic linear algebra, calculus, and programming skills). The remaining five weeks were dedicated to research experiences, mostly 1-2 week research collaborations led by top faculty and research scientists in the field.\n\n\nSGI 2023 was overwhelmingly successful, exceeding expectations for the technical and broader impact-oriented aims of the program. Some highlights are included below:\n\nA central aim of SGI is to bring a diverse set of new members to the geometry processing community. 82.8% of SGI Fellows (among survey respondents) self-identified as members of an underrepresented group in computing or mathematical sciences, and numerous countries were represented among the fellows.\nAfter the program, many SGI Fellows reported that they were likely to pursue graduate education (MS, PhD) in geometry processing and related fields. PhD admissions are ongoing as of this report, and many 2023 Fellows reported submitting applications to top programs. Several SGI faculty mentors reported they were likely to recruit SGI Fellows for their research groups.\nSimilarly to the previous offerings, SGI 2023 was held completely online. The program pioneered techniques in online research-based education that we plan to use over the longer term.\nMIT EECS has used SGI as a model program for efforts promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) among applicants for our graduate program. It is now included in MIT EECS's strategic plan for DEI efforts moving forward.\nSeveral research projects launched during SGI continued beyond the end of the program, and we are currently seeing resulting papers submitted to top conferences and journals in our discipline.\n\n\n\nReaders are invited to visit theSGI 2023 blogfor write-ups by SGI Fellows describing some of the many projects they completed: http://summergeometry.org/sgi2023\n\n\nData collection among the participants (Fellows and mentors) reflected many of the positive points above. Example student feedback includes the following:\n\n\"The tutorial week was amazing. It was amazing how much better I got at programming over the course of a week.
