 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will identify key science questions that can help reveal novel atmospheric chemistry processes and data fusion techniques that could be applied to address poor air quality in African megacities. African megacities have a unique mix of pollutants, emission sources, and meteorology. The future economic development of these cities are distinct from other more well-studied regions in the US and Europe. This workshop will assess and report on observational and modeling requirements that can address the unique chemistry in the atmosphere of an African megacity. Understanding the evolving influence of African megacities on regional to global atmospheric chemistry is critical for both air pollution control at local scale levels as well as predicting their role in climate change. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will be held on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and is planned as a 2.5-day meeting for September 13, 2023. A workshop web page will be used to announce workshop agenda, presentations, and final consensus reports. This effort will help develop a globally engaged scientific workforce that can focus on collaborative efforts to address the unique issues associated with air quality in African megacities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
