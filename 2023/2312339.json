 "awd_abstract_narration": "The GLOBE Program community has over the past 28 years created an openly accessible database with over 233 million measurements and growing at an increasing rate of almost 2 million submissions per month. As the program continues to grow, it needs to build on the success of the past as it attempts to address current challenges and others that may lie ahead. The 2023 Globe meeting will focus on Open Science, contributing to sponsors\u2019 strategic objectives. Thus, GLOBE plans to increase its impacts beyond its community and into the wider Earth and Space Science and science education communities. \r\n\r\nThe GLOBE Program\u2019s measurement databases are freely accessible. As one of the core principles of Open Science, the 2023 Annual meeting will address how GLOBE program elements exemplify the principles of Open Science and align with sponsoring Agency priorities around data accessibility. Meeting sessions will explore and address the theme Open Science through the following strands: 1. Mobilizing Beyond Borders; 2. In and Beyond Classrooms; 3. Mapping Beyond Dots; and 4. Open Science Benefits the Environment/Society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
