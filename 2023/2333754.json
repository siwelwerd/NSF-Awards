 "awd_abstract_narration": "BIOGEOMON 2024 will be held January 7-11,2024. It is the 11th international conference focused on understanding ecosystem biogeochemistry of soils, forests, rivers, and wetlands with special attention given to anthropogenic effects studied at the watershed, landscape, and global scale. BIOGEOMON 2024 will be held at University of Puerto Rico at R\u00edo Piedras, a Hispanic-serving institution in San Juan, Puerto Rico, marking the first time BIOGEOMON will be held in a tropical landscape. While the BIOGEOMON conferences have always attracted a diverse group of attendees, the 2024 organizing committee is emphasizing diversity, equity, inclusion, justice, and accessibility (DEIJA) explicitly in the conference design.  Travel subsidies funded through this grant will open attendance to many more students, early career scientists, and scientists from under-represented groups from Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and throughout the continental USA.  \r\n\r\nIncorporating changes to both the conference program and the support team for attendees will help this conference serve as a model in how to broaden participation and scope of inclusive small conferences.  While most of the requested funds will be used to provide travel grants to early career scientists from underrepresented groups, the organizing committee has planned several events that will educate all attendees on issues related to equity and diversity in the field of biogeochemistry, including a DEIJA forum  and a workshop on the socioeconomic and sociocultural dimensions of biogeochemical research.  The committee will use recommendations gathered from peer-reviewed literature and reports on running inclusive conferences to implement a variety of measures that will make the conference more inclusive as well as enhance the scientific program, including incorporating Universal Design principles into talks and meeting rooms, providing extensive networking opportunities, designing a conference code of conduct, and establishing a group of onsite Inclusivity Liaisons who can assist attendees during the conference. The organizing committee will gather data on the effectiveness of these measures before, during, and after the conference which will be included in a report that can be used by organizers when planning future conferences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

BIOGEOMON is an international conference focused on understanding ecosystem biogeochemistry of soils, forests, rivers, and wetlands with special attention given to anthropogenic effects studied at the watershed, landscape, and global scale. BIOGEOMON is held approximately every three years and has historically alternated between Europe and North America. BIOGEOMON 2024 was the first BIOGEOMON conference held in a tropical ecosystem, and the conference organizers developed several initiatives to make all scientists feel welcome, included, and valued. Organizers attempted to incorporating diversity, equity, inclusion, justice, and accessibility (DEIJA) explicitly in the conference design through several initiatives such as a\r\n\r\ndeveloping a travel grant program forstudents and members of groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences;\r\ncreating a training for session chairs on inclusivity at scientific meetings;\r\nwriting a Code of Conduct that all attendees agreed to follow; and\r\nincluding a DEIJA-themed keynote and workshop in the conference schedule.\r\n\r\n\n\nThe effectiveness of these programs was assessed using a post-conference survey that was completed by approximately half of the attendees. The travel award program provided travel grants to 24 students, members of underrepresented groups, and Puerto Rican scientists ranging from $250 to $2500 (average grant = $1250). Of those 24 awardees,17 were either undergraduate or graduate students and 20 self-identified as members of groups historically underrepresented in the sciences. Post-conference survey results suggest the efforts were successful: 93% percent of survey respondents either strongly or somewhat agreed with the statement \"BIOGEOMON 2024 was a welcoming and equitable conference.\" In response to the statement \"I was treated respectfully and felt I had an equal opportunity to express myself,\" 96% of respondentseither strongly or somewhat agreed.\r\n\n\nIntellectual merit: BIOGEOMON is inherently multidisciplinary, bringing together scientists from ecology, hydrology, geology, and biogeochemistry who share the goal of publishing their high-quality science in top-tier peer-reviewed journals. Conference organizers have organized a special issue of Biogeochemistry to highlight work from the conference and are working on a publication of all abstracts.\r\n\n\nBroader impacts: Although BIOGEOMON has always valued inclusivity and diversity, organizers sought to make this conference a model in how to broaden participation and inclusivity at small conferences.
