 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is in technically and commercially developing a transformative solution for tidal current energy converters (TCECs). The proposed technology has improved efficiency, minimal output speed variation, low-maintenance requirements, increased durability, and scalability through a wide range of sizes. It will lower the cut-in speed of a TCEC to low tidal current speeds and break tidal current energy harvesting technology limits. The TCECs will use the developed constant-speed generator system to generate constant-frequency power that is compatible with existing electric grid.  This project aims to enhance energy security by diversifying the energy mix with untapped tidal current energy resource. Academic, industrial, and commercial partnership in the project will foster knowledge sharing, leveraging complementary capabilities, and sharing risks and costs associated with technology development and commercialization. This collaboration will technological advancements, reduce costs, reconcile policy trade-offs, and encourage companies to invest and engage in this sector. Sustainable entrepreneurship training in the project will support participants throughout their entrepreneurial and leadership journeys, demonstrating a genuine dedication to their long-term success and increasing the future workforce in the marine energy industry.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will conduct use-inspired research on the infinitely variable transmission  (IVT) technology to address techno-economic hurdles for TCECs, which can balance economic, technical, and environmental constraints. TCECs with the IVT can harness tidal current energy with low tidal current speeds, and the U.S. sea regions that can be used for tidal current energy harvesting can be increased from 2% to 70%. The project will address some major technical hurdles on ecological issues in the commercialization process of the IVT, operation and maintenance, and real water testing which is a major bottleneck for innovators of TCECs to bridge the gap from small- to full-scale prototypes. The project will (a) synergize research efforts on life cycle assessment for environmental impact evaluation and energy consumption of TCECs via incorporation of uncertainties and variability and end-of-life management to reduce the effect of these constraints on both economic and ecological aspects of TCECs; (b) develop a condition-based predictive maintenance monitoring system for the IVT by incorporating oil condition monitoring and other diagnostic parameters to detect early faults; and (c) conduct floating vessel testing for a scale-up TCEC with the IVT by increasing the size and capacity of the IVT to reach commercial-scale deployment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
