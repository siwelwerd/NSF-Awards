 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs.  Reed College is acquiring a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a broadband probe to support the research of Professor Miriam Bowring along with colleagues Shivani Ahuja and Gonzalo Campillo-Alvarado. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of synthetic chemistry, biochemistry, and catalysis. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in the Chemistry Department at Reed College and enables increased diverse representation of high school teachers and students through established outreach programs.\r\n\r\nThe award of the 400 MHz NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing undergraduate research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as mechanistic organometallic catalysis, metal ion transporter proteins, and synthesis of molecular sensors. Specifically, the instrument impacts research focused on understanding new mechanisms in synthetic organometallic chemistry of a platinum methyl complex and a bimetallic iridium-ruthenium catalyst. Additionally, the instrument enables the characterization of small molecule binders of bacterial ATP-binding cassette transporter proteins. Other investigations include characterizing the supramolecular confinement of petrochemicals using dynamic crystalline frameworks for sensing and separating complex chemical mixtures. In response to global helium supply challenges, the acquisition of this instrument includes a superconducting magnet with a low loss cryostat reducing the institution\u2019s consumption of helium.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
