 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2023 Synthetic Biology, Engineering, Evolution and Design (SEED) Conference will have an expanded range of topics and will emphasize burgeoning areas of synthetic biology such as synthetic applications for climate change and sustainability, and microbiome engineering for food and the environment.  The broader range of topics will allow the conference to host scientists and engineers with diverse backgrounds. The conference will also allow students and early career professionals to share their work and learn about new advances in a rapidly growing field. Additionally, the conference will promote the continuous growth of members of the synthetic biology community, encouraging discussions among normally separated scientists and engineers and encouraging collaborations, which are critical for the development of new synthetic technologies and applications for biotechnology, agriculture and medicine.\r\n\r\nOver the past decade, the field of synthetic biology has rapidly developed from a research-based, theoretical discipline to one that is impacting society and will continue to grow in applications into the future. Since 2014, SEED has been the primary technical conference to gather people working in synthetic biology, including engineers, biologists, chemists, electrical engineers, computer scientists and more. The conference gathers an interdisciplinary audience to share technical presentations on cutting edge research and applications, network to develop relationships and connect people who may otherwise not have an opportunity to interact. Attendees include leaders in the field, established researchers, early career professionals and trainees who will lead the field in the coming decades. SEED\u2019s goal is to share insights into next-generation development strategies in synthetic biology research and industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
