 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will provide partial funding for participants in the international algebraic geometry conference G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Alg\u00e9brique en Libert\u00e9 (GAeL) taking place from July 3 - July 7, 2023 in Warwick (UK).  GAeL is an annual conference in algebraic geometry focused on promoting the careers of young researchers in the field, and it is unique among major conferences in the organization is nearly entirely managed by junior researchers.  This will be the 30th year of the GAeL conference.  GAeL has always been held in a European country, and funding is traditionally focused on participants coming from European based institutions.  However, the professional development opportunities offered by the conference are compelling for US-based participants as well, and funding from this grant will be used to enable junior researchers at US institutions to participate in the conference.\r\n\r\nGaEL XXX will bring together many leading experts on range of topics within Algebraic Geometry, providing an excellent opportunity for junior mathematicians to learn about major new developments.\r\nThe conference includes 3 senior speakers each giving 4 hour mini-courses, as well as a range of opportunities (short talks and poster sessions) for junior participants to present their own research in front of an international audience. The mini-courses are an opportunity to learn about cutting edge results and techniques, and they cover 3 distinct areas of algebraic geometry:  Mori Dream Spaces and quiver GIT; Specialization techniques in the study of curves; and Kawamata log terminal singularities. This conference is an excellent career opportunity for junior mathematicians entering algebraic geometry, due to the exposition on cutting-edge research and the new professional connections that are often made at the poster session and various social events. Further information can be found at the conference website: \r\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/gaelxxx/home?authuser=0\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
