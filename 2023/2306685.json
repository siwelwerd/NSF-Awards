 "awd_abstract_narration": "The adoption of next-generation applications, such as Augmented Reality and Internet-of-Things (IoT), is expected to grow rapidly in the years to come. The number of IoT devices is expected to reach 75 billion by 2025, while the scale of potential use-cases (e.g., smart cities with hundreds of thousands or millions of residents) is also expected to grow. In such use-cases, users may request the processing of data with temporal, spatial, or semantic similarity by servers physically close to them. The repeated processing of considerably similar data may result in the same processing outputs and thus the execution of duplicate (redundant) computation. This project advances our understanding of the notion of \u201ccomputation reuse\u201d, where the processing outputs are reused/shared among processing requests for similar data, having the potential to: (i) reduce the time for the processing of similar data and thus the overall latency perceived by next-generation applications; and (ii) eliminate the execution of redundant computation, so that the available computing resources are effectively utilized. Our project will result in a novel network framework, so that requests for the processing of similar data are identified and forwarded to the same servers, facilitating the reuse of computation in realistic infrastructure deployments. The research outcomes of this project will be incorporated into university course curriculum, while this project will also offer opportunities that broaden participation and diversity in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to advance the state-of-the art in edge computing architectures in order to facilitate the reuse of computation through a novel, hybrid network framework based on Information-Centric Networking (ICN)/Named-Data Networking (NDN) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). The proposed framework capitalizes on the best of both ICN/NDN and SDN to realize a service-centric, computation reuse-aware, and \u201csoftwarized\u201d architecture through: (i) the semantically meaningful ICN/NDN naming and stateful forwarding plane for the seamless and adaptive task forwarding towards edge servers that can reuse similar previously executed tasks; and (ii) the separation of forwarding and control planes and the programmable (logically) centralized SDN intelligence for the orchestration of the computation reuse semantics. This project will tackle fundamental challenges in the design and development of network systems for the realization of computation reuse in realistic edge computing environments, where multiple edge servers may be available for redundancy, fault tolerance, and load balancing purposes, facilitating the pervasive edge computing deployment.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by Networking Technology and Systems(NeTS)program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
