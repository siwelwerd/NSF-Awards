 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2023 IEEE ICNP conference will take place from October the 11th to 13th, 2023 in Reykjavik, Iceland. This project provides funding to assist 16 US-based graduate students for attending this conference. Participation in conferences such as ICNP forms a central part of the graduate school experience as it provides students with an opportunity to interact with senior researchers from academia and industry and exposes them to leading-edge research in the field.  IEEE ICNP stands unique in its emphasis on interactions between networking researchers at an international level, and attending ICNP presents an excellent opportunity for US graduate students to connect with a thriving international research community. The support requested in this proposal will enable students to attend the main conference and associated workshops at ICNP 2023. The travel grant co-chairs are committed to encouraging the participation of women and under-represented minorities. \r\n\r\nThis project proposes to provide travel support for graduate students to attend ICNP 2023 and the associated workshops. This program will expose students to new ideas in these emerging areas, and allow them to interact with other researchers thereby broadening their intellectual horizons.  By supporting graduate students to attend ICNP 2023, the grant specified in this proposal will increase the dissemination of the conference research results to a larger and more diverse audience, which otherwise would not have been able to attend. This grant will contribute to the strength and inclusiveness of the research community and will lead to the long-term health and vitalization of ICNP. In addition, by giving priority to grant awards to women and underrepresented students, we hope to increase participation among those groups. By advertising to a wide range of colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of institutions should be able to attend and benefit from the conference. A broad, as well as diverse population is key to the health of the research community and the discipline.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
