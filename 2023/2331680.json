BHI\u201923 will take place from October 15 to 18, 2023 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The theme of BHI\u201923 is \u201cTransforming healthcare and medicine with artificial intelligence (AI).\u201d It will provide a unique platform for cross-disciplinary researchers to showcase their research on big data analytics and machine learning that addresses challenges in biomedicine. An important mission of BHI\u201923 is to promote participation and engagement of undergraduate and graduate students, especially women and students from under-represented groups. The National Science Foundation (NSF) Student Travel Award will support this goal by providing travel awards to qualified students from under-represented groups and students who lack funds to attend the conference.\r\n\r\nWith the NSF support, the investigators expect to provide travel awards to approximately 30 students to encourage their participation in BHI\u201923. BHI\u201923 will provide the student awardees with opportunities to present their research, expand knowledge, network with world-class researchers, and broaden collaborations. Furthermore, participants will have access to keynote speeches, career and technology panels, special sessions, workshops, and tutorials. The investigators will promote diversity and equity by reserving at least 25% of the awards to students from under-represented groups and support first-time attendees to the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
