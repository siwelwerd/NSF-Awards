 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ocean warming driven by climate change has led to staggering losses of coral on reefs worldwide and is now among the most pressing of stressors threatening the survival of coral reef ecosystems today. As marine heatwaves associated with ocean warming become increasingly frequent, it is urgent to understand if and how reef-building corals will be able to respond to these repeat stress events and thus survive in a rapidly warming ocean. To address this problem, this project is investigating how corals on the reef respond to recurring marine heatwaves in order to identify if repeat exposure to heat stress promotes coral tolerance of higher temperatures via acclimatization or instead leads to the accumulation of stress and thus reduced performance and survival following future stress. The results of this study are critical for understanding how the current generation of corals will respond to increasingly warmer oceans, and whether acclimatization will buy enough individuals sufficient time for adaptation to occur and promote coral persistence into the future. In addition, this project is training students from secondary schools through advanced postdoctoral researchers in global change biology and ecology. Specifically, the investigators are increasing access to research opportunities for undergraduate students by developing a new hands-on course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) in Global Ocean Change Biology that will reach hundreds of students per year. Outreach efforts are also being developed to increase the participation and retention of historically disenfranchised students in marine science, and include creation of hands-on coral reefs and climate change activities for incoming first-generation, low-income undergraduate students and a professional development program to train middle and high-school teachers to deploy these climate change activities in their classrooms in the Philadelphia Public School District, which serves a predominantly low-income Black and Latinx student body. \r\n\r\nAcclimatization following exposure to sub-lethal heat stress may be an important protective mechanism for corals to survive a changing climate. However, the role of environmental memory of marine heatwaves in driving acclimatization or, conversely, stress accumulation and sensitization of reef-building corals is not well understood. This study is addressing this question using a combination of in situ and mesocosm experiments to assess the cellular, organismal, and ecological consequences of repeat heatwaves on corals with contrasting bleaching histories. Specifically, the researchers are monitoring adjacent conspecific pairs of bleaching-susceptible and bleaching-resistant individuals of two reef-building coral species in Hawaii, Montipora capitata and Porites compressa. These corals have been monitored for over 7 years through multiple bleaching events and are being used to test the hypothesis that environmental memory of marine heatwaves differentially alters coral thermal performance due to phenotypic variation in acclimatization ability within and between species. This work is identifying whether the bleaching thresholds of corals with different bleaching histories varies through time, and the consequences of these phenotypes on coral calcification, survival, and population size structure are being assessed using a combination of benthic surveys, photogrammetry, and in situ growth measurements. The influence of environmental memory of heatwaves on coral physiology is being assessed using thermal performance curves to determine how the thermal optima of respiration, photosynthesis, calcification, and host intracellular pH change (or not) over time (e.g. ambient vs. heatwave years) and if that response differs between corals with contrasting bleaching phenotypes. Finally, the contribution of algal endosymbionts to acclimatization is being evaluated by exposing corals to a range of increasing temperatures in experimental mesocosms, potentially uncovering differences in the degree of acclimatization or sensitization for host vs. symbiont traits in corals with high fidelity (P. compressa) vs. cosmopolitan (M. capitata) symbiont associations. By understanding of the phenotypic diversity in thermal performance across biological scales, this research improves predictions of coral persistence in the face of the ongoing climate crisis.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Biological Oceanography, Integrative Ecological Physiology, and Ocean Education Programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
