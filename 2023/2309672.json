 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST), this project aims to launch a CREST Center for Advanced Magnets and Semiconductors at Morgan State University. The center will advance scientific knowledge in advanced magnets and semiconductors, a field of great importance to modern technologies and the nation\u2019s economy. The center will support the establishment of a new research and education hub by consolidation of collaborations with neighboring institutions. This CREST center consists of three integrated research groups and one education and outreach group. The Center will conduct education and outreach activities through the following programs: (1) hosting summer institutes for high school students and science teachers, (2) launching new graduate programs in materials science, (3) organizing collaborative materials symposia and seminars, and (4) sending students to external internships for new research experiences.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research aims to address three emerging areas of fundamental and technological importance in the field of advanced magnets and semiconductors and will be conducted by three research groups: (1) Magnetoelectric materials; (2) Radiative and radiation active quantum material heterostructures; and (3) Wide bandgap semiconductor quantum devices. The outcomes of this center are expected to be: 1) creating new knowledge in advanced magnets and semiconductors for national technology advances; 2) creating graduate programs for underrepresented minorities (URMs) in materials science; 3) preparing high school and undergraduate URMs for STEM careers; 4) creating a research hub for advanced materials leveraging the proximity to governmental laboratories and universities; (5) establishing competitive research in advanced magnets and semiconductors at Morgan State University. The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program provides support to enhance the research capabilities of minority-serving institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
