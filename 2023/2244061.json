 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the University of Pennsylvania, located in Philadelphia, PA, supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2023-2025. In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry, undergraduate participants aim to develop diverse approaches to improving chemical reactions, computationally mapping reaction mechanisms and solid-state chemistry, and investigating chemical science with relationship to semi-conductors.  These efforts will be performed with the mentorship of faculty and graduate students or postdoctoral associates. An aspect unique to this site is that participants also gain exposure to high throughput experimentation (HTE) methods, training that is often limited to industry. Exposure to HTE provides a distinct experience for participants, one with long-term leverage into both academic and industrial career pathways. Participants take part in regular professional development activities where they hone their communication skills, explore career paths, and learn about responsible research conduct, preparing them for advanced degrees in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe research projects available for participants span a significant space across catalysis: method development, catalyst development, and synthetic applications as well as extension into molecular dynamics, solid-state chemistry and beyond. This program recruits students nationwide, with an emphasis on underrepresented student groups. A wide raging network of industrial and academic collaborations expose participants to a variety of viable career pathways with the goal of sustaining a diverse and competitive chemical science workforce. \r\n\r\nThis Site is supported in part by funds provided to the National Science Foundation by the Semiconductor Research Corporation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
