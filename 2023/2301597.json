This academic conference is run by the Conservation Paleobiology Network, an NSF-funded network with over 650 members from 44 countries based out of the Florida Museum, University of Florida. The potential conference attendees come from all over the world and specialize in a variety of topics such as paleontology, archaeology, conservation science, and historical geology. Participants will include people from universities, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. This conference will provide a way of connecting specialists who would not otherwise have a chance to meet and exchange ideas. By funding student registration fees, this proposal will help to attract and engage students, particularly those from historically underrepresented groups, thus nurturing the next generation of scholars and educators. The participation of students is important for science and society. Not only will these individuals be the future of the growing discipline of conservation paleobiology, but they often have new approaches and apply the science in new and important ways. Fees for conferences are often expensive and difficult for many students to afford. By covering their registration fees, the conference is made more accessible to students.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThis proposal covers the cost of student registration fees for the Conservation Paleobiology Symposium in Gainesville, Florida from February 16 to February 19, 2023. This academic conference is organized by the Conservation Paleobiology Network, an NSF-funded network with over 650 members from 44 countries based out of the Florida Museum, University of Florida. The potential conference attendees are geographically, disciplinarily, and professionally diverse, and include people from academic institutions, state and federal governmental institutions, and non-profit organizations. The sub-disciplines of potential attendees include, but are not limited to, paleontology, archaeology, conservation science, and historical geology. This conference will provide a venue for cross-disciplinary specialists who would not otherwise have opportunities to meet and exchange ideas. By funding student registration fees, this proposal will facilitate our efforts to attract and engage students, particularly those from historically underrepresented groups, thus nurturing the next generation of scholars and educators. The participation of these individuals is critical to the health of the field, which directly impacts and benefits the shared future of our society. Not only will students and individuals from underrepresented groups be the future of the growing discipline of conservation paleobiology, but they commonly have new approaches and use novel applications. Registration fees for conferences are often expensive and difficult for many students to afford. By covering their registration fees, the conference is made more accessible to students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
