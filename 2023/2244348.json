 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Carnegie Mellon University, Mellon College of Science, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, will support the training of four scholars participating in mathematical science or physics projects for eight weeks and six scholars working on biology, chemistry, or computational projects for 10 weeks during the summers of 2023-2026. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from under-represented groups, will be trained in the program. In addition to undertaking an independent research project, scholars participate in professional development and community building activities organized by departments and the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion office of Mellon College of Science. Scholars are also able to expand their networking outside of the daily programming as they reside together. The goal is for scholars to develop contemporary skillsets that can keep pace with developing technologies. By promoting interdisciplinary collaborations to investigate scientific questions, the program alumni will not only be able to handle real world problems but also be the solutions.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this program are to: a) increase scholars access to information about graduate school, scientific research, conference meetings, and other career opportunities with respect to STEM research; b) help scholars build professional networks and foster a sense of community within STEM research spaces; and c) improve scholars\u2019 ability to think creatively about research, and to work in interdisciplinary and collaborative modes. Students are recruited nationally at ABRCMS/ SACNAS meetings, via outreach visits, and by word of-mouth via former program participants and faculty connections. Each department is responsible for their own application and selection process with input from the Mellon College of Science Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion office. Applicants are holistically evaluated including their personal and professional accomplishments, and extenuating circumstances. The centerpiece of the program is the interdisciplinary experience. While scholars have deep experiences in their chosen discipline. Engrained in our curriculum are opportunities for scholars to expand their personal and professional networks. Scholars collaborate outside of their discipline to solve problems and improve their understanding of their chosen field. The current interdisciplinary world of today\u2019s science requires a range of skills and diversity of ideas to succeed in any endeavor. The inclusion of multiple disciplines allows scholars to have more opportunities to network and gain exposure to a community reflective of the growing workforce diversity.\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
