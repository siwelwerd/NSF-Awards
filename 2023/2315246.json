 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by designing, implementing, and evaluating the effectiveness of phenomenon-based science instruction on preservice science teachers\u2019 understanding of science and nature of science. Since the phenomenon-based learning (PhBL) approach grounds learning in real-world issues or phenomena of an interdisciplinary nature and centers on the learners, inquiry, and problem solving, the project hopes that focusing on the pedagogical aspects of PhBL will prepare participants for teaching science via this method. As such, this project anticipates that the PhBL experience will enhance preservice teachers\u2019 performance on pedagogy and content teacher certification exams and ultimately support their future science teaching. Building upon several fundamental meta syntheses on best practices for teaching science and nature of science to Latinx students, the research team will design robust phenomenon-based activities as a base for creating and implementing PhBL workshops for prospective teachers, science faculty members, and science educators. In addition, science faculty members and science educators will participate in additional workshops and a webinar to learn about PhBL approach and reflect on the designed activities. The unique geographical location of the project implementation will increase the likelihood of positively advancing the science and nature of science knowledge of hundreds of students and teachers from historically disenfranchised groups and of contributing to the participation of the full spectrum of diverse talent in the area. This project falls under the IUSE Track 1: Engaged Student Learning, Level 1.\r\n\r\nThis project\u2019s goals center on strengthening preservice science teachers\u2019 science content knowledge and nature of science knowledge, enhancing science teachers\u2019, science educators\u2019, and science faculty\u2019s science pedagogical knowledge, and influencing the persistence of preservice science teachers in their program of study and their mastery of pedagogy and science content exams for teacher certification.  The project responds to the call from the Next Generation Science Standards regarding the significance of preparing materials and training teachers in anchoring student learning in phenomena to learn, apply, and build science. By using PhBL, this project embraces the critical need for preparing science teachers who possess both science and nature of science knowledge while also being proficient in research-based instructional methods aligned with standards. First, the project will develop ten PhBL activities and an accompanying lesson guide for instructors. The development of the guide aims especially to support science teachers implementing PhBL who lack sufficient experience with these types of instructional materials. Second, the project will hold five 16-hour workshops for providing professional development for 125 preservice teachers to learn about PhBL and how to implement it. In addition, science faculty members and science educators will also participate in this professional development as well as two additional workshops focused on the pedagogical aspects of this teaching strategy. Third, this project will use qualitative methods to investigate the influence of the professional development on preservice science teachers\u2019 understanding of science and the nature of science as well as their capacity for designing a PhBL lesson plan. The project aims to facilitate the use of PhBL as a research-based active learning pedagogy that increases undergraduate students\u2019 knowledge of science and nature of science and contributes to their persistence in degree attainment and completion, especially for those planning to be science teachers. Due to population demographics in the local area of implementation, research outcomes should advance the field of science learning and teaching in diverse settings. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program has contributed funding to this project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
