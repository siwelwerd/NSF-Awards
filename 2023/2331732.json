 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel award will support a collaboration between the CSforAll Expanding Girl Power by Design project in the U.S. and the Managing Identities in Diverse Societies Project in Italy. The Girl Power team is developing two theoretical concepts to understand girls' STEM identity, while the Managing Identities team is conducting a longitudinal study to identify supports for the well-being of adolescents with and without a migrant background. Through this collaboration, the two teams will inform and learn from each others\u2019 approaches, ultimately generating knowledge to support girls in STEM within the contexts of the United States, Italy, and beyond. The Girl Power Team will conduct two short-term visits to Emilia-Romagna, Italy, each lasting approximately three weeks, to conduct comparative analyses of minoritized communities across the two international contexts.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this collaboration is to engage in a comparative analysis of identity development of minoritized girls with access to and engagement with culturally responsive curricula and technologies across two international contexts. In this respect, the research team aims to identify whether the phenomena of Reciprocal Recognition and Critical Amplification are ones that function similarly beyond the localized context of the study in the United States to the broader international context in Italy. The collaboration will involve two short term visits to the research site in Emilia-Romagna, Italy by a core team consisting of the U.S. PI, two senior researchers, and three graduate students. As education researchers from Italy and the United States, respectively, they will examine the impact of concepts of national identity, safety, and criminalization on immigrant ethnic minority girl students' identities in both countries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The purpose of our visit was to better understand how adolescents develop identities in diverse learning ecologies. We collaborated on a co-authored paper entitled <em>From Inclusive Schools to Inclusive Societies: School Diversity Climate and Adolescents Psychosocial Adjustment</em>. The purpose of the study was to examine the impact of school diversity on academic achievement and school well being for adolescents who were either ethnically Italian or ethnic minorities who migrated to the region. A total of 1,156 adolescents (51.65% females and 48.35% males) residents of the Emilia Romagna region, Italy, completed four assessments across one year. Most participants (78.96%) were Italians (i.e., both they and their parents were born in Italy), while 21.04% had a migrant background (i.e., themselves or at least one of their parents was born outside Italy). Results highlighted that both perceived equal treatment and support for contact and cooperation were associated with adolescents&rsquo; higher levels of social well-being and academic achievement. Longitudinally, perceived equal treatment by teachers led to a higher sense of school belonging, contributing to increased social well-being. Students' ethnic backgrounds moderated the impact of the school diversity climate on youth's social well-being. Overall, findings highlight how inclusive schools can generate more inclusive societies. In May, Dr. Norris and team members conducted a three-part interactive lecture series for graduate students from the University of Bologna&rsquo;s Psychology Department. The first lecture, entitled, &ldquo;Transmediation: How Digital Ethnography and Critical Discourse Analysis Can be Used to Examine Storytelling Across Social Media Platforms&rdquo; was conducted by Dr. Norris and Nayla Rodriguez. During the lecture, they discussed how social media users narrate stories across platforms. This lecture provided examples of the ways narratives are told across social media platforms. Attendees examined social media posts. The second lecture was conducted by Dr. Norris and Maha Elsinbawi. The focus was on social design based research (DBR). We explained the theoretical principles behind DBR and provided the participants with examples from the Girl Power project. Lastly, Dr. Norris facilitated a lecture entitled &ldquo;Qualitative Data Analysis: How Codes and Themes are Developed Using Grounded Theory.&rdquo; During her lecture, Dr. Norris drew on Corbin and Strauss&rsquo; (2008) constant comparative method of grounded theory. She explored ways that codes can be used to classify concepts under various categories to extract emergent themes (Creswell, 2014). Participants were provided an opportunity to code sample data sets to see how themes might be developed. Norris also discussed how generalizations might be made from data analysis and compared to the existing literature. In September 2024, Drs Norris &amp; Liz&aacute;rraga presented at the European Association of Researchers on Adolescents conference in Limassol, Cyprus at a symposium entitled &ldquo;Righting the Wrongs: Interventions and Protective Factors to Promote Resilience for Vulnerable Groups of Children and Young People. Our paper, &ldquo;Culture Matters: How Teachers Support Girls&rsquo; Identities in Classrooms in Northern California&rdquo; was met with positive reception from conference attendees.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/02/2024<br>\nModified by: Aaminah&nbsp;Norris</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2331732/2331732_10893333_1727920161025_6_italy--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2331732/2331732_10893333_1727920161025_6_italy--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Presentation Photo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2331732/2331732_10893333_1727920161025_6_italy--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Presentation Photo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Three women in front of the screen during her presentation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yocelyn Medina Neri</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Aaminah&nbsp;Norris\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Presentation Photo</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2331732/2331732_10893333_1727920411455_3_italy--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2331732/2331732_10893333_1727920411455_3_italy--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Team Standing in front of Building\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2331732/2331732_10893333_1727920411455_3_italy--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Team Standing in front of Building\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Standing in front of the IDENTITIES Research offices</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yocelyn Medina Neri</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Aaminah&nbsp;Norris\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Team Standing in front of Building</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2331732/2331732_10893333_1727919769026_Italy_collage--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2331732/2331732_10893333_1727919769026_Italy_collage--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Italy Collage\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2331732/2331732_10893333_1727919769026_Italy_collage--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Italy Collage\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Collage of group photos from our trip to Italy.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yocelyn Medina Neri</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Aaminah&nbsp;Norris\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Italy Collage</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
