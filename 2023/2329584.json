 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing and implementing an array of early undergraduate research experiences for students that begin their academic pathway at a two-year college. Access to this type of high-impact practice early in the STEM pathway at highly diverse institutions is critical for expanding and diversifying the STEM workforce across the country. To address this, the project team will create a unique STEM pathway for engaging students in undergraduate research prior to transferring to a four-year university. As part of this model, students will work directly with faculty mentors on shared research projects that address issues of interest to student participants. Students will also be supported by a dedicated advisor that will provide both guidance and resources for academic success that complements the research experiences. These activities will promote retention in two-year college STEM pathways and will ultimately contribute to diversifying the STEM workforce in the region. \r\n\r\nThe project team at the Community College of Baltimore County will carry out the following project objectives:  1) Create and/or finalize the scope and sequence for four research courses including the faculty-led research components; 2) Support 15-30 students with research stipends and participation in STEM conferences each year of the project; 3) Provide students with resources and expertise to successfully transfer to a four-year university; and  4) Engage in assessment and evaluation activities to gain a better understanding of the impact that early research experiences have on student success both before and after transfer. This study will extend current models for implementing early undergraduate research experiences at two-year colleges by providing a multi-level cross-disciplinary approach throughout the first two-years of STEM introductory coursework.  Additionally, this work will capture how sustained research participation impacts student success, retention, transfer, and attitudes towards science using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods.  An external evaluator will partner with the project team to provide both formative and summative feedback at regular intervals. The results of the project will be disseminated to the two-year college STEM community via publications, presentations, and professional networks. The NSF program description on Advancing Innovation and Impact in Undergraduate STEM Education at Two-year Institutions of Higher Education supports projects that advance STEM education initiatives at two-year colleges. The program description promotes innovative and evidence-based practices in undergraduate STEM education at two-year college.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
