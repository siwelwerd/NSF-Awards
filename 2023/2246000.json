 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alfve\u0301n waves in space plasmas have been studied for several decades. They have been recorded in the magnetospheres of planets (e.g., Earth, Jupiter), the solar wind, as well as the solar atmosphere. Despite the great differences in the plasma properties of these regions, the overarching themes of research are wave generation, wave propagation, and wave dissipation, which are three fundamental aspects of any kind of waves. A fourth aspect of waves is their application, either with direct benefit to humans or for scientific pursuit. This grant funds support for an international conference focusing on research in Alfven waves. Support includes travel for student and early career scientists to participate and present at the conference. An AGU monograph and a special issue of a journal are planned for disseminating the results presented.\r\n\r\nThe Chapman Conference on Advances in Understanding Alfven Waves in the Sun and the Heliosphere will be held in Berlin, Germany from May 28-June 2, 2023. This interdisciplinary conference aims to bring together scientists from different communities to review and discuss the current state of research on Alfven waves in space plasmas, including the solar atmosphere, the solar wind, planetary magnetospheres and ionospheres, and laboratory plasmas (if relevant to space plasmas). Two prior wave-related Chapman conferences focused on ultra-low frequency waves (Magnetospheric ULF waves in 2005, Low-frequency waves in space plasmas in 2014). While the first one focused on waves in Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, the second one was interdisciplinary, including waves in the solar atmosphere and other planetary magnetospheres (e.g., Jupiter, Mars).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Students were able to also present their own work and exchange ideas with more senior scientists.
