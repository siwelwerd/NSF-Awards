 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Hawaii Manoa project supports upgrades in networking capacity for research locations to improve networking performance and data transfer throughput. The project covers disciplines including physics, astronomy and bio-sciences.  It supports large data transfers between research locations and UH\u2019s Mana High Performance Computing (HPC) Cluster as well as real-time streaming data transfers between research locations and the telescopes on the summit of Haleakala on Maui. \r\n\r\nThis project provides upgrades for three locations by upgrading connectivity from 1Gbps/10Gbps to 100Gbps and a minimum of 10Gbps to local workstations/clusters. 100Gbps upgraded connectivity to the Institute for Astronomy and the Pacific Biosciences Research Center Kewalo Marine Lab is enabled by upgraded transponders on the existing wide area network while on-campus fiber upgrades provide 100Gbps connectivity to the Physics building.  SciDMZ aggregation switch upgrades provide support to connect new 100Gbps connections. Increased capacity enables 100Gbps connectivity between Mana HPC and research locations. 100G connectivity to the Haleakala summit allows high throughput streaming of data for camera systems at the Daniel K. Inoyue Solar Telescope. A router based SciDMZ provides high throughput data transfer between Mana HPC and the global Research and Education networks. Researchers are now able to leverage the robust and high bandwidth network that the University has built across both the State of Hawaii and to the global network to increase their data transfer rates and increase researcher productivity. \r\n\r\nThis award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
