 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project promotes the progress of science and advances the national health, prosperity, and welfare by investigating magnetically-controlled microrobots. These millimeter-scale microrobots are able to steer through delicate human tissue and may revolutionize many medical procedures. By steering around anatomical obstacles, the microrobots have the potential to deliver targeted medical treatment, such as drugs, diagnostic materials, and/or thermal ablation to sites in the body that are currently difficult or impossible to reach safely. These microrobots move through the body via the use of an external rotating magnetic field, such as a permanent magnet held and rotated by a robot arm on the outside of the body. However, the way in which these microrobots precisely move through tissue as a function of the external magnetic field\u2019s motion is not currently sufficiently understood for use in any clinical application. The research team will pursue fundamental research to provide needed knowledge in how these microrobots move through soft tissue, how to precisely control them along desired paths, and how to plan paths that safely and accurately reach desired targets in the body. This research involves several disciplines including computer science, mechanical engineering, mathematical modeling, control theory, and robot motion planning. The research approach and associated outreach and educational activities will help to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in robotics, computer science, and mechanical engineering, as well as positively impact computer-science and engineering education.\r\n\r\nThe technical aims of the project are divided into two thrusts. Improving understanding of magneticscrew microrobots\u2019 mechanics is the focus of the first research thrust of this project. Prior work has significantly simplified the mechanics of these devices, resulting in high modeling uncertainty as well as operating regimes that were deemed unstable due to lack of a complete understanding. The project will instead pursue a paradigm shift in mechanical modeling, gathering a fully accurate and principled understanding of the steering behavior of these robots. Specifically, the research team will investigate a sequence of increasingly complex modeling methods, fitting to experimentally gathered data, based on magnetic interaction principles. For the external magnetic field, the project will consider both uniform fields and dipole fields. Beyond modeling, how to accurately control and plan motions for these microrobots is not yet understood; this is the focus of the second research thrust. The project will first investigate iterative nonlinear control methods to create path-following algorithms for these robots that are adaptive and robust to actuation noise and model inaccuracies. Additionally, the project will investigate motion-planning methods for these robots that account for their capabilities, leverage learned state sampling, and reason about uncertainty in their mechanics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
