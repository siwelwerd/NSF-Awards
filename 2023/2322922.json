 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the Exchange of Mathematical Ideas Conference which will take place August 11-13, 2023 at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls, IA. The conference will be the next offering in the Annual Conference for the Exchange of Mathematical Ideas (EMI) series, which started in 2012 and has run every year except in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The topic of the this year\u2019s conference will be Algebra and related fields.\r\n\r\nThe 2023 EMI Conference will bring together participants drawn from expert and seasoned mathematicians pushing the frontiers of research in algebra. Particpants will have a unique opportunity to: (i) learn about open questions and promising research directions in algebra and related fields, (ii) share mathematical ideas, methods, and approaches, (iii) explore new research avenues and possibilities for collaboration with mathematicians from geographically and institutionally diverse colleges and universities, (iv) engage in networking activities with diverse participants, including women, underrepresented minority, and persons with disabilities, at the same or different levels along the career ladder, and (v) disseminate research results through a conference proceeding. In this way, the objectives of the conference align perfectly with the larger national goal of developing and growing the STEM personnel base, and mathematics acumen in particular, wherever the potential exists across the nation. The conference website will be located at the following URL https://math-dept.info/EMI-2023.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
