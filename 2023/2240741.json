 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the Richmond Geometry Festival: Knots, Moduli, and Strings taking place between June 2-4, 2023, at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA.  This conference aims at bringing together specialists in two research fields: low-dimensional topology and algebraic geometry from various career stages and from a variety of institutions. In addition to lectures by internationally recognized experts, vertically integrated participation will be fostered by a poster session, featuring work by early-career researchers, and a Career and Mentorship Panel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first two (virtual) editions of the Richmond Geometry Festival were held in 2021 and 2022. These events showcased new trends in knot theory, algebraic geometry, and string theory, and emphasized interrelationships in the study of braid varieties, Khovanov homotopy, complex Chern-Simons theory, link lattice homology, and the Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas correspondence in families. The third edition of the Richmond Geometry Festival will provide an in-person venue for dissemination of the most recent results in this exciting line of research.  More information can be found on the Richmond Geometry Festival website: https://sites.google.com/vcu.edu/gtmp/festival.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This event brought together physicists and mathematicians working at the intersection of knot theory, moduli spaces, and string theory for the purpose of discussing recent advances in the field, as well as identifying new avenues of research. The Richmond Geometry Meeting was attended by 92 registered participants including undergraduate, graduate students, postdocs, and more senior researchers. Nine 60-minute talks were given over the course of three days: 1) Slava Krushkal \"A 4-manifold invariant from topological modular forms''; 2) Beibei Liu \"Skein exact sequence in Heegaard Floer homology''; 3) Charles Doran \"Motivic Geometry of Two-Loop Feynman Integrals''; 4) Hulya Arguz \"Quivers, flow trees and log curves''; 5) Reimundo Heluani \"PBW bases of Ising modules''; 6) Jim Bryan \"The enumerative geometry of nano banana manifolds''; 7) Antonio Alfieri \"Instanton Floer homology of almost-rational plumbings''; 8) Dragos Oprea \"Cycles on the moduli space of abelian varieties''; 9) Pavel Putrov \"Analytically continued Chern-Simons theory on plumbed 3-manifolds.'' In addition to the above listed talks, thirteen posters by graduate students and postdocs were presented at the meeting. The Richmond Geometry Meeting also featured a panel whose purpose was to encourage junior researchers to ask questions to panelists representing mathematicians at various stages of their academic and non-academic career. Ample time between talks was scheduled in order to maximize the impact of the interactions between participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/11/2024<br>\nModified by: Marco&nbsp;Aldi</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
