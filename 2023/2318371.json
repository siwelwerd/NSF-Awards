 "awd_abstract_narration": "The exponential increase in the ability to compute, store and exchange massive amount of data is fueling transformative changes in the human condition. This has led to a highly connected world with information being accessible at remote and diverse parts of the world. These strides in data processing, storage and communication technologies are creating large networks of interdependencies covering various devices as well as humans. The challenges of managing the complex networks of interactions can only be addressed through interdisciplinary approaches. A workshop is proposed that will bring together leading experts in Control and Game Theory, their applications and associated areas to forge new research thrusts to address the challenges posed by distributed, networked, systems. The workshop will bring the involved researchers together to evolve a synergistic and effective collaborative community in the Midwest region. The workshop will create opportunities for students and researchers early in their academic careers to present their results in poster sessions and lightning talks, and to present opportunities for collaborations. The workshop will target increased participation of women speakers and researchers. Synergies with industry will be sought through enabling students to explore employment opportunities as well as relevant internship positions.\r\n\r\nThe workshop\u2019s technical goals are at the intersection of game theory, informational sciences, mathematics, and control theory and their applications. Increasingly, privacy and security concerns are motivating distributed architectures that are resilient to failures of a few subsystems and offer better means to ensure information is not breached. On the methodologies front, automated learning based on data gathered is offering solutions for managing complex systems that are difficult to control/manage using more traditional means of identification with a leaning toward a model-based approach based on fundamental physics-based principles. In this workshop, leading researchers and students will convene to address topical themes that will help delineate the challenges precisely and to offer solution methodologies for the challenges above. It will also serve to continue interactions of the growing research community in the workshop topics in the Midwest.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
