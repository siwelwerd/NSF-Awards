 "awd_abstract_narration": "Needle-based interventions (NBIs) are procedures that require a minimally invasive approach to mitigate tissue damage. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project aims to develop an intelligent and miniaturized imaging platform that can recognize tissue structures in real-time. The resulting platform will be small enough to fit inside of a medical needle and able to quickly collect detailed images that will train an automated machine learning tool for improved needle guidance. The outcomes of the research will inform the design of future technologies to improve NBI outcomes and multi-contrast imaging. A comprehensive integrated education plan will be initiated to serve Native American students. This effort will allow Native American students to have access to world-class research facilities and increase STEM participation and retention. Other educational activities including curriculum development and specific microscope demonstrations for local K-12 students will be organized to increase the students\u2019 interest in bioimaging.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER project will establish a new research paradigm for imaging in needle-based interventions through integrating a unique forward-imaging multi-contrast optical coherent tomography (MC-OCT) needle technology with advanced computer-aided guidance tools. Endoscopic systems have been widely reported, however, they are not suitable for NBI guidance as they are limited by probe size and optical design. The proposed MC-OCT needle will incorporate forward-imaging capability and eliminates the need to scan optics inside the body. This miniaturized OCT system can fit inside the hollow bore of relevant needle geometries for different NBIs without additional invasiveness and needle modification. Integrated quantitative polarization-sensitive capability into this MC-OCT needle device will promote further understanding the tissue composition and enhance the contrast between different tissue types. In collaboration with the Riverside Indian School, the project will develop the Biophotonics for Native Americans in Oklahoma program to engage and mentor local Native American high school students and teachers in biomedical engineering and optics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
