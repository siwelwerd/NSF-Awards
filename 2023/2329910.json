 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the next Quadrennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) as specified in the law, Section 5 of Public Law 108-153 and Section 201 of the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (P.L. 114-329). This National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) study focuses on the analysis of the nation's nanotechnology research and development (R&D) infrastructure and its impact on nanotechnology R&D. It determines the trends and opportunities for future nanotech research, the metrics used to track and evaluate success, and the improvements needed to achieve equitable and impactful national engagement in existing and future nanotechnology infrastructure. The outcomes of this study are critical feedback to Federal Agencies, Academia, and Industry. They learn how the community is currently being served by the nation's nanotechnology R&D infrastructure and what barriers remain. This study also provides important feedback to the wider NNI community and interested stakeholders. The resulting study report is beneficial to nanotechnology researchers in the US as well as industrial companies involved with current and future applications of various nanotechnologies. The report also benefits education and workforce development. It is disseminated to the technical community and public through briefings, presentations, reports and on-line at nap.nationalacademies.org. \r\n\r\nAdvances in nanoscience and nanotechnology have spurred innovations in many areas of science, engineering, technology, and medicine including materials and chemicals, electronics and photonics, biotechnology and healthcare, and others. These advances have pushed interdisciplinary and convergent research bringing together scientists and engineers from diverse fields and of diverse backgrounds towards common goals of ensuring that the US remains a leader in nanotechnology R&D and that the benefits of nanotechnology are shared by all Americans. This study examines the composition of the science and engineering community currently being served by the nation's nanotechnology R&D infrastructure; explores trends, opportunities, and emerging use-cases for nanoscience and nanotechnology research; examines how well positioned nanotechnology-relevant infrastructure is to be impactful; and identifies barriers to use for communities who are not fully engaging with nanotechnology R&D infrastructure. The review recommendations are designed to improve the value of the NNI's research and development strategy, portfolio, and infrastructure investments to enhance the economic prosperity and national security of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
