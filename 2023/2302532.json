 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2023 Midwest Several Complex Variables Conference will be held April 28-30, 2023 on the Columbus campus of Ohio State University. The Midwest Several Complex Variables conference series has a long tradition serving as the primary regional meeting in complex analysis and related areas. The event provides ample opportunity for leading experts in the field and junior researchers to interact with each other and to pursue new collaborative projects. This award provides funding to cover travel expenses and accommodation of participants without access to other sources of external support, particularly graduate students and early career mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThe event focuses on recent developments at the interface of several complex variables, harmonic analysis, operator theory, functional analysis, and complex geometry. Several of the highlighted topics include Bergman spaces and unexpected mapping properties of the Bergman projection (and other canonical operators), singular integrals on domains with minimal smoothness, solvability of the Cauchy-Riemann operator in new geometric settings, CR complexity theory, and canonical metrics in several complex variables. In addition to the invited talks, conference activities will offer a stimulating environment for participants to discuss promising new directions in these areas. A poster session for graduate students will afford an opportunity to present their work and meet future colleagues in the field.\r\n\r\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/mwscv-2023\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
