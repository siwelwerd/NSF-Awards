 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fire is an important process that reflects the integration of natural and cultural systems. Fire activity in the Great Lakes Region of North America abruptly declined in the late 1800s, as seen in a network of tree-ring-based fire scars from the region. The resulting ecological changes are particularly evident in forests of Bapakwanegemag- red pine (Pinus resinosa)- an important tree species for generations of Anishinaabe peoples and a major timber resource. Red pine is dependent on recurring surface fires to create the necessary conditions for its regeneration and persistence on the landscape. After a century of fire exclusion, natural red pine regeneration has become rare, forest density has increased, and high-severity fire risk has increased dramatically. It is critical to understand the drivers behind these changes, which requires an expansive and diverse array of expertise and knowledge. This project establishes the necessary relationships and collaborations among fire ecologists, fire practitioners, and Indigenous knowledge practitioners to advance understanding of  Indigenous fire stewardship practices. Fire restoration to red pine forests will be a key process for promoting the diverse and resilient ecological and cultural landscapes of the future. \r\n\r\nWorkshops will be held across the upper Great Lakes Region to establish a framework to bring Traditional Ecological Knowledge, tree-ring fire history data, and mechanistic modeling approaches together to better understand the historical role of fire in shaping pre-colonization forest landscapes while building capacity to care for fire-adapted systems. The goals of the workshops are to: 1) connect faculty, instructors, and staff at state and tribal colleges to lay the foundation for an Indigenous Fire Science degree program that will enhance training and capacity in fire science and stewardship, 2) cultivate a network of fire practitioners across the Great Lakes Region to promote sustainable and diverse landscapes, and 3) weave together multiple types of knowledge to help restore and maintain red pine ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis project was co-funded by NSF\u2019s Geoscience Opportunities for Leadership Development (GOLDEN) program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
