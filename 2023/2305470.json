 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. In collaboration with North Carolina State University (NCSU), Benedict College (BC) seeks to enhance the undergraduate curriculum and provide adequate knowledge, hands-on training, and certifications in data science and machine learning for HBCU students.\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s four overarching objectives are to: (1) develop joint data science and machine learning programs, (2) integrate experiential learning and internships, (3) develop learning laboratories for research and teaching, and (4) develop joint learning and research programs. HBCU students taking the new proposed courses will learn how to solve real-world problems using data science and machine learning modules in the classroom. They will also be provided with academic year experiential learning and summer research opportunities at BC and NCSU. In addition to strengthening STEM undergraduate education and research at an HBCU, the project will also enable students historically underrepresented in STEM to improve their marketability and create sustainable industrial internships for those interested in emerging data science and machine learning fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
