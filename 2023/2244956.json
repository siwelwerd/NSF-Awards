The purpose of the conference is to promote a safe environment for young LGBTQ+ mathematicians. Such a conference will allow students to establish meaningful connections at early stages of their careers, which will positively impact inclusiveness in the future. SSMC will further serve as a stepping stone for young researchers to discuss the creation of similar events in the future. \r\n \r\nTo promote interdisciplinary research, the conference will be open to every topic of mathematics, including, for example algebra, combinatorics, numerical analysis, topology, and partial differential equations. There will be three guest speakers for this conference: Dr. Seth Sullivant (North Carolina State University), Dr. Mary Lynn Reed (Rochester Institute of Technology) and Dr. Alexander Hoover (Cleveland State University). Participants will also be given the opportunity to give twenty minute talks about their recent research accomplishments. These talks will facilitate collaboration between participants and allow young researchers to learn about a variety of prominent research areas in mathematics. More information is available at the conference website: https://sites.google.com/view/ukyspectra/ssmc-2023.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
