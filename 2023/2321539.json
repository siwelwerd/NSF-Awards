 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the need to significantly increase preparedness to respond to active shooter events. During active shooter events or emergencies, the ability of public safety professionals to react appropriately to the situation is driven not only by pre-existing knowledge and skills but also depends upon state of mind and familiarity with similar scenarios. The primary focus of the activities in this project is to increase the efficiency and preparedness of public safety professionals for active shooter events, with a focus on the design of future technologies for conducting emergency response training. The pilot research in this project involves developing immersive virtual reality instructional modules to serve as a platform for emergency training to be deployed across institutions of higher education (IHEs). These active shooter response training drills and exercises will facilitate the implementation of emergency operation plans and the translation of plans into action. Overall, the project serves as the basis for training workers of the future in the important work context of emergency response. \r\n\r\nThe pilot research in this project involves conducting preliminary experiments to improve preparedness for an active shooter event using an immersive virtual reality environment.  This work builds on an existing virtual reality instructional module for active shooter response and will expand the simulation environment to include public safety professional training with an active shooter scenario. The research will engage 15-200 university volunteers (faculty, staff, and visitors) and the instructional modules will be built and evaluated with 15-20 public safety professionals from Bowie State University. A pilot study will be conducted for training in immersive and non-immersive virtual environments. Overall, this work will contribute to the state-of-the-art emergency response research and results could form the basis of public education and awareness programs to help facility occupants, public safety professionals, and IHE officials to respond appropriately during emergencies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These active shooter response training drills and exercises will facilitate the implementation of emergency operation plans and the translation of plans into action. Overall, the project served as the basis for training workers of the future in the important work context of emergency response. Leveraging virtual reality (VR) provides an immersive context for training by providing an innovative and engaging way to excite the user in learning. Immersive VR training is a valuable tool to train people for preparation of active shooter events as it offers hands-on learning experiences for situations, which are difficult to replicate in real-world conditions.</p>\r\n<p>This research effort demonstrated an experimental platform in a multi-user VR environment (or collaborative virtual environment) for conducting immersive training and virtual evacuation drills for active shooter events. The research effort involved development of two virtual reality instructional (VRI) modules for a real-time building on campus at two universities: Bowie State University (BSU) and University of North Texas (UNT). The two VRI modules developed were: &nbsp;1) Active Shooter Module for Civilians or building occupants (based on run, hide, and fight) and 2) Active Shooter Module for security personnel training in an indoor building. The immersive security personnel training module incorporated four sub-modules namely 1) Situational assessment module, 2) Individual officer intervention module, 3) Team Response Module, and 4) Rescue Task Force module. This immersive multi-user VR training platform allowed for the collection of data in response to an active shooter event in a campus building at two universities (BSU &amp; UNT). The immersive VR environment was developed using Unity 3D gaming engine software and sketch-up application software. The work also involved developing algorithms for implementing behavior (such as hostile, non-hostile, selfish, and leader following) for NPCs (non-player characters) or AI agents in active shooter events environment. The grant leveraged research in&nbsp;AI, VR, data science, data analytics, and visualization.</p>\r\n<p>The research in this project involved conducting preliminary experiments to improve preparedness for an active shooter event using an immersive virtual reality environment. The research engaged 195 university volunteers (faculty, staff, and students) and the VRI modules were evaluated in immersive and non-immersive virtual environments. The evaluation included questions on 1) Demographic Questions, 2) Student Assessment of Their Learning Gains (SALG) Instrument, 3) Group Environment Questionnaire (GEQ), 4) Presence Questionnaire (PQ), 5) System Usability Scale (SUS), and 6) Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) Questionnaire. Overall, this work contributed to the state-of-the-art emergency response research and results could form the basis of public education and awareness programs to help facility occupants, public safety professionals, and IHE officials to respond appropriately during emergencies. The findings suggest that participants' knowledge, intrinsic motivation, and self-efficacy significantly increased immediately following the training.
