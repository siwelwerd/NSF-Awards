 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this project will investigate promising practices that demonstrate potential to increase the number of Hispanic students earning degrees in STEM fields. Hispanic students are entering higher education at unprecedented rates but are enrolling in STEM programs at lower rates than their peers. This gap may be partially explained through factors such as the lack of Hispanic representation among STEM professionals and faculty, a lack of awareness about STEM careers, and persistent financial barriers. This pilot project at Lehigh Carbon Community College in Pennsylvania will introduce Hispanic students to STEM fields and careers through the Aspira STEM Track, offering hands-on activities, guest speakers, group discussions, and peer mentoring. Through this work, the college will explore the impacts of these activities on student retention, sense of belonging, and knowledge of STEM academic and career pathways. Anticipated outcomes include more Hispanic students will enroll in STEM programs and report a greater sense of belonging and connection to their chosen field of study.\r\n\r\nLehigh Carbon Community College aims to create a community of mutual support among 30-40 STEM-interested Hispanic students in the Aspira STEM Track. This project will make use of a fourteen-week, one-credit hour course where cohorts of first-year students participate in active learning exercises, such as group work, data analysis and problem-solving activities including mini labs, to increase their awareness of STEM fields and careers. Through journaling, group discussions, guest speakers, and peer mentoring, the program will empower students to develop a sense of belonging and connection to the STEM community on- and off-campus. Interventions including scholarships and peer mentoring will promote equity by providing financial support, mentorship, and connection to academic resources for students participating in the Aspira STEM Track and intending to enter a STEM career path. Additional faculty professional development will increase inclusive teaching practices within the college\u2019s STEM disciplines. It is anticipated that through the Aspira STEM Track: (1) At least 80% of students will be retained in a STEM program from semester-to-semester; (2) At least 90% of students will report greater understanding of STEM academic and career pathways; (3) At least 80% of students will report a greater sense of belonging; and (4) At least 75% of STEM faculty will be educated on inclusive teaching practices. A meta-analysis of qualitative and quantitative student data will be completed through the project and will add to the current literature on Hispanic belonging and STEM identity on-campus. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
