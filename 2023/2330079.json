 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a metallic nanoparticle synthesizer designed for academic, small-scale, and government laboratories. Currently, academic and small-scale laboratories either purchase or manually synthesize nanoparticles for utilization.  However, users report high expense and variations in quality from purchased nanoparticles, and manually synthesizing nanoparticles was found to be laborious and necessitated extensive training to yield viable nanoparticles with consistent performance.  The proposed technology automates the process and eliminates the need for manual intervention. In addition, the process may enable researchers to generate more accurate and consistent results by providing batch-to-batch reproducibility and control over the physical dimensions of the nanoparticles produced.  This may have an impact on the development of advanced biosensors, nanomedicine, and targeted drug delivery systems and improve healthcare outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of an automated metallic nanoparticle synthesizer.  The proposed technology is designed to enhance efficiency of nanoparticle production, supplying laboratories with particles on demand and reducing the time and expense associated with outsourcing nanoparticle synthesis.  In addition, the proposed process may enhance control over the synthesis process, including the dimensions, morphology, and composition of the nanoparticles, enabling customization for specific research requirements.  The proposed synthesizer has been shown to generate 100 mL of 20 nm diameter gold nanoparticles. Additionally, it is equipped with an automated heat bed featuring feedback control and precise peristaltic pumps for accurate regulation of synthesis temperature and optimal reagent delivery, which may ensure superior quality and minimize batch-to-batch variability. The proposed technology may transform nanoparticle production in laboratories, facilitating nanotechnology-based research and innovation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
