 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims to acquire a High-Speed Volumetric Particle Tracking Velocimetric (VTPV) system capable of tracking the three-dimensional position of multiple particles within a measurement fluid volume, and subsequent calculation of velocity, or acceleration of the particles. Active research projects that would benefit from the instrument range from blood pumps to miniature medical devices to microplastics transport in the environment. The list of active research projects is expected to grow with new opportunities and collaborations. The proposed system will improve Rochester Institute of Technology\u2019s ability to conduct leading-edge research by enhancing the infrastructure for research and education. Specifically, planned research and training at Rochester Institute of Technology and the region includes (1) student training and research, (2) two new multidisciplinary courses, and (3) training workshops. \r\n\r\nThe proposed VTPV instrument is comprised of high intensity laser illumination, a set of digital cameras, and specialized optics that are integrated with dedicated synchronization hardware and image processing software. Each of the five projects described has previously benefitted from acquisition of two-dimensional fluid or particle data with the existing outdated 2D measurement system. The new data to be acquired by the proposed three-dimensional high-speed system will increase quantitative understanding of underlying flow physics, and in some cases, providing the first ever quantitative data relevant for the application.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
