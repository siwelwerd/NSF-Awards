IEEE GLOBECOM 2023 will take place in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on December 4-8, 2023. This project funds undergraduate or graduate students from US universities to attend IEEE GLOBECOM. Attending such a high-caliber technical venue is extremely valuable for students. Not only will they be exposed to the state-of-the-art research areas, but they also can have the opportunity to interact with peers from institutions worldwide, meet with leading researchers from both industry and academia, and take part in discussions that may shape the future of the field. For graduating senior students to be on the job market, attending the conference may significantly benefit their career development. Applications are invited from qualified full-time US-based graduate and undergraduate students. Women and underrepresented groups will be encouraged to apply for this travel grant, in order to promote participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.\r\n\r\nThe requested support will cover 16 students, leading to a total of $20,000. Applications are invited from qualified full-time US-based engineering graduate and undergraduate students. Women and other underrepresented groups in STEM, beginning graduate students, and first time IEEE GLOBECOM student attendees will be especially encouraged to apply for this travel grant.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
