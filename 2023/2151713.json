 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an acceleration in how new materials are discovered, designed, and commercialized in the transition to a carbon-neutral economy.  One aim is to increase the use of renewable electricity in the chemical and energy industries.  A major hurdle is the lack of efficient electrocatalysts that enable renewable processes, such as green hydrogen production, carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion into carbon-neutral chemicals and fuels, or other processes that can broadly decarbonize various industries. Traditional discovery methods are slow and serial, which limits the development of novel, commercially viable electrochemical processes demanded by the climate crisis. This project will enable a more rapid and exhaustive search for electrocatalysts, resulting in a deeper understanding of the nature of catalysts, and facilitating the decarbonization of the chemicals and energy industries by displacing traditional fossil fuel-based processes with a transition to electrification which utilizes increasing levels of renewable energy. The proposed platform will expedite the discovery and development of enabling materials, which can be brought to market and deployed globally to enable more renewable chemical processes.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a generalizable platform that can rapidly search through vast materials spaces for higher performance electrocatalyst materials, displacing the current materials which are simply the best amongst the limited candidates tested to date. Using this project\u2019s proprietary Megalibrary technology, which enables the rapid synthesis of libraries of tens of thousands of unique, well-defined, monodisperse, and complex metal nanoparticles in a single experiment, coupled with high-throughput screening technologies, it is possible to quickly probe hundreds of thousands of unique catalyst candidates to find electrocatalysts optimized for performance. To accomplish this goal, the project must adapt protocols to allow the synthesis of electrocatalyst Megalibraries on electrodes and enable electrocatalyst screening. Additionally, the approach requires robust and high-throughput screening methods that can site-specifically interrogate the electrocatalytic properties of the catalyst candidates. Using these two innovations, it will be possible to then demonstrate the power of the platform by searching the entirety of a three element platinium and materials (Pt-M1-M2) space for the best hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst on a per platinum-atom basis. This demonstration will solidify the ability to translate this platform to a much broader materials space and set of reactions, which can impact businesses and industries globally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For example, the production of hydrogen by steam methane reforming, one of the world&rsquo;s largest volume chemical processes, is responsible for ~10-14 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents emitted per kg of hydrogen produced. Alternatively, the electrolytic production of green hydrogen can be powered by renewable electricity, bringing the total lifecyle emissions of green hydrogen to near zero. This electrolysis approach for producing hydrogen can be applied to many other chemicals whose production is similarly dirty, yet significant development is required to achieve cost parity between the existing production method and a cleaner electrolysis route.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><br />Specifically, all electrolysis processes rely on electrocatalyst materials that can perform the requisite chemistry efficiently over long periods of time, and ideally these electrocatalysts are relatively cheap and abundant. Within the green hydrogen industry, proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers rely on platinum and iridium catalysts, both of which are expensive and rare, and alternatives to these catalysts are necessary to achieve large scale deployment of PEM water electrolysis; for other chemical processes, the optimal catalysts are entirely unknown. Therefore, to accelerate the transition from the status quo production of chemicals to greener electrolysis alternatives, novel electrocatalyst materials must be discovered and optimized to enable commercially viable electrolysis technologies.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><br />The discovery and optimization of electrocatalyst materials is traditionally serial and slow, and is a critical bottleneck in electrolysis; Mattiq is aiming to change this paradigm, and during their Phase I project, they matured, industrialized, and demonstrated the power of their proprietary ultrahigh-throughput electrocatalyst discovery technology. Mattiq is developing a closed-loop pipeline for the rapid development and optimization of electrosynthesis technologies, or Mattiq's materials disovery funnel (Figure 1), wherein a massive number of catalyst materials are iteratively tested and narrowed down to the most promising candidates for prototype-scale testing; the ultrahigh-throughput catalyst discovery comprises two key steps in this development process (Steps 1 and 2 in Figure 1).</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><br />More specifically, during the Phase I project, Mattiq was able to optimize the synthesis of high-quality catalyst libraries on electrode substrates with massively increased yield and reproducibility (from &lt;30% overall yields to &gt;80% overall yields). These are critical steps forward in the maturation of Mattiq&rsquo;s catalyst discovery technologies for the following reasons:</div>\n<ul class=\"p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet\">\n<li>High-quality and high-yield catalyst libraries prepared using Mattiq&rsquo;s proprietary catalyst library synthesis technology contain hundreds to tens of thousands of well-defined multimetallic catalyst candidates, each of which represents a potential viable catalyst for an electrosynthetic process.

While this demonstration is, in itself, not of major commercial significance, it validates the potential impact of the technology. Throughout this demonstration, &gt;300,000 datapoints were generated in a short period of time, &gt;80% of the available materials within the platinum-iridium-ruthenium materials space were synthesized and tested, and a 90% experimental success rate was achieved.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><br />The developments in this Phase I project have laid the groundwork for the utilization of Mattiq&rsquo;s ultrahigh-throughput technology for the rapid discovery and optimization of novel electrocatalyst materials, which is a critical need for the growing clean chemicals industry. Mattiq is now pointing this technology towards applications that can have large commercial and environmental implications, and expanding capabilities to close the loop in the overall development pipeline showed in Figure 1 by developing prototype-scale testing and optimization capabilities. Leveraging the high-throughput catalyst discovery technologies developed in Phase I, Mattiq can rapidly discover the most promising catalyst candidates, and iteratively scale and test those materials at commercially relevant scales.</div>\n<div class=\"p-rich_text_section\"><br />Overall, Mattiq&rsquo;s proprietary technology is poised to play a critical role in the transition from the status quo, which involves fossil feedstocks and high-temperature and high-pressure reactors, to a more renewable chemicals production economy powered by renewable energy and electrocatalyst materials.
