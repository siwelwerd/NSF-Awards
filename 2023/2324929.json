Commutative algebra is an extremely vibrant field of mathematical research, with fundamental connections to many other disciplines, and has an influential female mathematician, Emmy Noether, as one of its founders. The workshop will feature research on seven different topics within commutative algebra, with fourteen group co-leaders suggesting problems of study and guiding the lines of inquiry. WICA II will expand the research portfolio and collaborative networks of the approximately forty-two participants in attendance. This workshop will create leadership opportunities and provide mentorship for early-career mathematicians, while also making a positive impact on those who are geographically isolated at their home institutions. \r\n\r\nThe topics to be investigated at this conference include Lefschetz properties of graded algebras, tensor decompositions, Waldschmidt constants and resurgence, Rees algebras of determinantal ideals, probabilistic models in commutative algebra, commutative algebra aspects of Schubert Calculus, and free resolutions. These are themes of current interest in the field and the workshops will advance commutative algebra by making scientific advances on each of these topics.  More information can be found at the workshop website  https://mathstat.dal.ca/~faridi/WICAII.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
