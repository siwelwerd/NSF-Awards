 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many contaminants in coastal waters adhere to fine sediments. To predict how sediment-associated contaminants are transported it is necessary to know how the sediment moves. The amount of friction by waves and currents that is necessary to resuspend surface sediments is a key factor for sediment transport. The amount of friction needed depends on the size of the sediment grains and on biological processes at the surface of the bed. Algal mats and bacterial films can make it harder to resuspend sediment. However, a strong physical disturbance such as a hurricane can break down the mats and make resuspension easier. This project will study Florida coastal sediments impacted by Hurricane Ian. Time series samples will show how the sediment bed susceptibility to resuspension evolves over the course of a year. This will enable improved predictions about where sediment and sediment-associated contaminants are transported after strong storms. The study also will examine the difference in the evolution of the bed between an undeveloped area surrounded by a mangrove fringe and a developed area that is bordered by seawalls. Prior studies suggest that mangroves trap fine sediments. Bays surrounded by mangroves have larger sediment grains than bays in developed areas without mangroves. The fine sediments in developed bays are more easily available for resuspension. This can enhance the movement of sediment-associated contaminants, and hurricanes have been shown to mobilize sediment-associated heavy metals. This study will have broader impacts by helping predict whether contaminants are likely to be trapped or transported away from regions that are struck by large storms. The study also will inform coastal development choices regarding implementation of mangrove fringes at the water\u2019s edge. This is timely since many homes were destroyed near the southwest Florida coast and will soon be restored. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the critical shear stress of the seabed is necessary to predict the transport of sediment and sediment-associated contaminants. This is especially important, but not well studied, after intense disturbance to the bed caused by storms. The proposed research assesses the evolution of the critical shear stress of the seabed in two coastal bays in southwest Florida after the passage of Hurricane Ian. The critical shear stress depends not only upon the size of the sediment, but the opposing effects of algal mat and bacterial biofilm production versus bioturbation.  A rapid response is essential because the biological development may also be rapid, and the effect of the hurricane will be lost if not measured soon. The study will compare how the evolution of the bed differs in a coastal bay that has had extensive development, including the replacement of fringe mangroves with hard stabilization structures, with a nearby but undeveloped bay with no anthropogenic development. The study will measure the critical stress using a Gust erosion chamber on three replicate cores from each of the two sites on a quarterly basis. The amount of bioturbation will be assessed quarterly as well, using X-radiographs of triplicate cores at each site and beryllium-7 profiles. It is hypothesized that the critical shear stress will initially increase as bacterial and algal films develop, then decrease as macrofauna reestablish within the benthos.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The critical shear stress and erodibility of the seabed depends not only upon the size of the sediment, but the opposing effects of algal mat and bacterial biofilm production versus bioturbation and bioadvection. We also compared how the evolution of the bed differed in a location that has had extensive development (Naples Bay) with a nearby but undeveloped bay (Dollar Bay) with no anthropogenic development (Fig. 1).</p>\r\n<p>Right after the hurricane, the median eroded sediment was lower at both sites, reflecting the higher critical shear stress and consolidated bed. The amount of eroded mass at the end of the 0.45 Pa step increased significantly and by nine months after the passage of the hurricane remained about the same (Fig. 2). Sediment from Dollar Bay was consistently more erodible than that from Naples Bay. These results suggest that during the hurricane, the bed was eroded to a consolidated layer that had a high critical shear stress and low erodibility. As time passed more unconsolidated sediment was deposited, or bioturbation increased the erodibility, or both.</p>\r\n<p>Total inventories of the radioisotope <sup>7</sup>Be activity show the supply of recently deposited sediment (Fig. 3). Dollar Bay accumulated new sediment more rapidly after scouring by the hurricane than Naples Bay, but both reached peak inventories in fall 2023 when rainfall was higher. Activity rates dropped at both sites during the dry season of winter 2024. Dollar Bay also had consistently higher total activity rates than Naples Bay, suggesting higher deposition rates. These data are consistent with the erodibility analyses that suggested that Dollar Bay received sediment deposits by the summer, while Naples Bay did not have much sediment deposition until fall. The overall higher erodibility of Dollar Bay is also consistent with the <sup>7</sup>Be inventory pattern of more deposition of fine sediments at Dollar Bay. The differences in the summer values also suggest that rainfall was not the main determinant of <sup>7</sup>Be variation, since the rainfall would have been the same for the two geographically close stations. Profiles of <sup>7</sup>Be down to 7 cm in the core demonstrate that the newly deposited sediment was rapidly mixed under the bed by bioturbating organisms, such as <em>Alpheidae sp</em>. (snapping shrimp, Fig. 4).</p>\r\n<p>Current velocities at Dollar Bay were much stronger than those at Naples Bay and exhibited a more recognizable tidal pattern (Fig. 5). These differences in current velocities were likely responsible for most of the differences observed in the evolution of the respective beds at each site.

Instead of depositing sediment, the hurricane scoured the seabed at both sites to a more consolidated layer. Critical shear stress was higher just after passage of the hurricane and erodibility was lower. By summer 2023, the undeveloped site, Dollar Bay, had recent sediment deposits as shown by <sup>7</sup>Be counts. These deposits were more easily erodible and in the next two seasons as more sediment was deposited the bed became more erodible. Additionally, the hurricane likely dampened bioturbation along with the scouring. By summer 2023 bioturbating organisms were recruited to the area as evidenced by <sup>7</sup>Be profiles exhibiting bioadvection, and by visual inspection of cores. The sediment bed at the developed site, Naples Bay, lagged in recovery compared to Dollar Bay because of the enclosed basin and resultant minimal flow dynamics there.</p>\r\n<p>Prediction of sediment transport after storms using numerical models must first establish the condition of the seabed after the storm. We found that scouring by the storm left a seabed with a consolidated surface critical shear stress between 1 and 1.5 Pa at Naples Bay and Dollar Bay, respectively. After deposition of fine sediment, the critical shear stresses dropped to around 0.25 Pa at both sites. Deposition at the Naples Bay site was lagged about 3 months because of the lower energy environment and reduced sediment availability. Both sites were recolonized by bioadvectors within 9 to 12 months of the hurricane, with the Naples Bay site again lagged one season behind the Dollar Bay site.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the intensity of Hurricane Ian, the seabed at the two study sites appeared to have stabilized and recovered within a year of passage of the storm.
