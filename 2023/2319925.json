 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enzymes are special proteins inside cells that hold chemical reactants in precise positions to accelerate bio-chemical reactions. While they are involved in chemical reactions, enzymes are not used up in the reactions. Studying these reactions at a fundamental level is particularly challenging, because it requires detecting individual enzymes. With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Jeffrey E. Dick at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is advancing electrochemical methods for studying single enzymes. Working with his students, Professor Dick is creating tiny electrodes that can characterize chemical reactions catalyzed by a single enzyme in volumes smaller than a single cell. The project has the potential to offer new ways of studying chemical reactions in cells and impact the development of ultrasensitive biosensors. In addition, the activities provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students who will become the next generation of electrochemists and biotechnologists. The group is also developing electrochemical instruments for use in high schools around the United States, broadening the impact of the project beyond the research laboratory.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program is funding Dr. Jeffrey E. Dick at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to develop electrochemical methods to detect and quantify single enzyme molecules. The amount of current a single enzyme produces depends on its maximum turnover rate. Common enzyme turnover rates are on the order of 1000 Hz, implying the amount of current generated by a single enzyme is under a femtoampere. This tiny current cannot be detected and quantified with reasonable bandwidth. With his students, Dr. Dick is developing potentiometric-based methods to address this fundamental limitation. Potentiometry is a powerful technique in that it requires a very small, variable bias current to produce a potential measurement, and the measurement itself is independent of electrode size. The amplification of a single enzyme\u2019s turnover is achieved by trapping a single enzyme molecule within a sub-attoliter volume, synthesized as an emulsion or fabricated via nanofabrication. In these small volumes, effectively a single enzyme biosensor, a single enzyme\u2019s physicochemical properties are rigorously evaluated using novel electrochemistry-based measurement methods developed in this research project. The project also focuses on methods that hold promise to specifically and rapidly detect single virus particles such as COVID-19.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Therefore, if new measurement tools are developed, new truths of nature can be unveiled. The project &ldquo;Electrochemical Methodology for Single Molecule Enzymology&rdquo; has made the immeasurable measurable. Enzymes are molecules that are critical to the genesis and propagation of life. Results from this award, forged from the development of new measurement tools, have shown that enzyme chemistry actually depends on the volume of the reactor where the chemistry is being played out. This discovery upends over a century of scientific thought because small volumes (like our cells and vesicles) are more biologically relevant than studying reactions in beakers. The project has also worked to understand the curious chemistry in small volumes by further developing stochastic electrochemistry. Stochastic electrochemistry is a sub-set of electrochemistry where one can interrogate the chemical reactivity of single atoms, molecules, and nanoparticles. This award has focused on studying chemical reactions in single, sub-femtoliter droplets, one at a time. Many of the breakthroughs that have come out of this project rely on single droplet interrogation on ultramicroelectrodes, which are able to robustly quantify reaction kinetics in droplets that are even smaller than the diffraction limit of light. Results from this award have contributed to more precise instrumentation development and measurements of chemical reactions that are important in liquid aerosols, including in the detection and positive identification of species like SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, results from this award have shed light on important chemical processes that occur in multiphase environments, yielding important results to push forward knowledge in bioanalytical systems, energy storage and conversion devices, and synthetic methods that take advantage of interfaces. For instance, we developed a method to quantify bubble forces at interfaces far away from the electrode surface using electrochemiluminescence. One important result from the project is the development of a new method to study liquid microdroplets in air. Electrochemistry is rather difficult in air; however, by integrating microwires with ionic liquids, a method to electrochemically interrogate single microdroplets, where a majority of the interface is the liquid|air interface, has been developed. These results also have implications in environmental science. While the science itself broadly impacts several disciplines (chemistry, biology, biophysics, sensors, biocatalysis, and so on), results from the project include developing pedagogical methods to bring new measurements to middle school students. The project has achieved this by developing a short course for middle school students at Purdue University, and they learned the power of measurement development by creating their own ultramicroelectrodes to interrogate single particles. Results from this award have also seen the development of a portable measurement technology (called the SweepStat) that can be easily mailed and assembled, and several students around the world have performed electrochemical measurements of acetaminophen in their kitchens. Through the award, over 45 students, ranging from middle school to graduate school, have been involved. Results from this research have had broad implications on different fields of science while also developing a framework to train the next generation of scientists.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/04/2024<br>\nModified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;E&nbsp;Dick</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2319925/2319925_10679543_1709579934976_smll202308637_fig_0001_m--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2319925/2319925_10679543_1709579934976_smll202308637_fig_0001_m--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Single Liquid Aerosol Microparticle\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2319925/2319925_10679543_1709579934976_smll202308637_fig_0001_m--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Single Liquid Aerosol Microparticle\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A) Schematic of the electrochemical cell used for aerosol capture and electroanalysis.
