 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide the basis for advancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hardware solutions for ultra-fast image acquisition. The proposed effort will target clinical MRI scanners where there is limited MRI access by a large patient population. Long scan times reduce the efficiency of radiology department processes and increase the overall cost to clinics and patients. A successful solution which decreases scan times by half will provide improved patient access and care, especially with regard to measuring metabolic activities, brain activity, and cognition.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop high resolution MRI as a powerful tool for understanding metabolic activity in humans and animals. High dielectric constant (HDC) materials provide a low impedance pathway between the patient and magnetic coil of the MRI. The goal of this project is to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the MRI by over 50%, thereby cutting the scan time by half.  The HDC materials will have an immediate impact on animal and human behavior studies where neuroscientists are using MRI techniques to monitor brain activity and cognition.  An integrated development approach includes electromagnetic simulation, ceramic processing, and phantom testing.  A working prototype will be tested in clinical MRI scanners thus creating an innovative ecosystem comprised of original equipment manufacturers, hospitals, and researchers with clinical experience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
