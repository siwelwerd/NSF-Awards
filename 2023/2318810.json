 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a conference travel grant for the PI to participate in a panel discussion at the South by Southwest Conference (SXSW) 2023 (March 10 - March 19, 2023, in Austin, Texas). He is one of several NSF supported researchers who were selected to discuss The Science and Ethics of De-extinction. The panel discussion was submitted to SXSW by NSF; it was accepted for presentation and scheduled for March 14, 2023. Because the panel occurs at a popular, public-facing science and technology conference, insights will be shared immediately with conference attendees, who come from the many sectors that interface with science and technology: academics, technology developers, science enthusiasts, technology investors, and funders of research. The panelists participation at the NSF booth at the Creative Industries Expo will further disseminate insights and knowledge to broader audiences at the SXSW conference.\r\n\r\nThe topic of de-extinction raises key questions about anticipatory governance, responsible innovation, and the ethics of research and technology. This panel, with its multidisciplinary participants, is poised to wrestle with these issues in a format that will emphasize dialogue and exchange.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The panel, entitled, \"The Science and Ethics of De-extinction,\" explored the controversy surrounding using advanced biotechnology to bring back extinct or functionally extinct species, such as woolly mammoths, American chestnut trees, and passenger pigeons. The interdisciplinary group brough diverse expertise to interrogate ethical, social, scientific, and ecological dimensions of de-extinction projects. Key themes included the choice of species targets, the increasing ecological pressures on threatened species, the rationales for bringing back extinct species, the commercial and academic enterprises involved, and the common misperception that de-extinction is primarily focused on dinosaurs (which is not scientifically possible because insufficient DNA is available, among other challenges). The panel discussion was attended by SXSW conference attendees, who broadly represent entrepreneurs, researchers, technologically-savvy consumers, science enthusiasts, artists, and educators.
