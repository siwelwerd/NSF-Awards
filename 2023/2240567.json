 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for US based participants in the semester-long thematic program in Geometric Group Theory to be held at the CRM in Montreal, Canada during the months of January\u2013June, 2023. More particularly the award will support the travel of approximately 50 junior participants from institutions in the United States to the conferences and workshops taking place as part of the program. Geometric Group Theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with the symmetries of abstract geometric objects, which range from graphs (systems of networks) to surfaces to three-dimensional shapes such as our physical universe. The geometric study of symmetries is an active and rapidly expanding field. This award will enhance the conferences with additional connections and collaborations, and benefit US institutions by spreading new techniques, questions and research ideas, thus contributing to the training of the next generation of mathematicians.\r\n \r\nThe semester program will include 6 workshops around vibrant sub-areas of Geometric Group Theory: \u201cMeasured group theory\u201d looks at groups from a probabilistic perspective and is highly interdisciplinary; \u201cCube complexes and combinatorial nonpositive curvature\u201d includes new topics within a very well-established subfield of geometric group theory; \u201cGeometry of subgroups\u201d concerns the study of the geometry and finiteness properties of subgroups and is an emerging area in the field; \u201cGroups around 3-manifolds\u201d involves the interplay between 3-manifolds and Lie groups with geometric group theory; \u201cOrderable groups\u201d studies groups with an invariant left-order and is a classical topic that has become of recent interest through a broad range of applications; and \u201cHuge groups\u201d studies groups acting with infinite stabilizers and seeks to broaden successful aspects of the current theory.\r\nMore details about the semester activities can be found at this website: https://www.crmath.ca/en/activities/#/type/activity/id/38271\r\n \r\nPlease report errors in award information by writing to: awardsearch@nsf.gov.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
