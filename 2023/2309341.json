 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanoscale quantum optical systems enhance the efficacy of light-matter interactions by confining light in small regions. Such systems are integral to a myriad of emerging quantum technological applications: from building single-photon devices and storing and transmitting quantum information over long distances, to facilitating precision tests of fundamental physics. Thus, with growing efforts to miniaturize quantum systems, both with the fundamental motivation to explore quantum phenomena at nanoscales and also with the practical goal of developing modular on-chip architectures, atom-surface interactions at nanoscales become a central facet of developing novel quantum systems. However, when interfacing atoms at nanoscales from photonic structures, the ever-present quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field critically limit the ability to trap and control atoms. This work will develop ways to engineer such quantum fluctuation phenomena \u2013 forces, dissipation and decoherence \u2013 by leveraging the collective behavior of atomic systems and the ability to manipulate atoms with lasers. Overcoming these critical challenges in the design of nanoscale quantum systems will enable novel functionalities for quantum devices. In addition to the research goals, the PI will train a diverse undergraduate and graduate student workforce at the exciting intersection of Quantum Science and Engineering. As a part of the educational efforts, the PI will develop a multidisciplinary senior level course on Quantum Optics and Quantum Information, engaging students from a diverse array of Science and Engineering majors.\r\n \r\nThis research will build a driven-dissipative Open Quantum Systems approach to engineering quantum fluctuation phenomena \u2013 Casimir-Polder forces, dissipation and decoherence \u2013 in collective atomic systems near surfaces with the goal to achieve better control and coherence of nanoscale quantum optical systems. The proposed program will build and advance new tools to control quantum fluctuation phenomena, with four main thrusts: (1) Realizing well-controlled and coherent atomic systems at distances of 10-100 nanometers from surfaces by developing near-surface trapping and cooling schemes; (2) Extending the framework of Casimir Physics and macroscopic QED to study fluctuation phenomena with objects that can be prepared in quantum superpositions, entangled or collective states and driven externally; (3) Guiding  experiments on high-precision measurements of Casimir-Polder forces with atomic diffraction via nanogratings for creating repulsive drive induced Casimir-Polder forces and manipulating Casimir-Polder forces using collective effects; and (4) Mitigating fluctuation-induced decoherence in experiments with levitated dielectric nanospheres, to realize macroscopic quantum superpositions and correlated states of levitated nanoparticles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
