 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies show that mentored research experiences, cohort building, and student career development in inclusive environments effectively engage undergraduates in STEM career paths. The NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program supports internship programs at institutions across the nation that provide valuable educational experiences for undergraduate students through participation in research. It also aims to increase the participation of the nation's diverse talent - particularly underrepresented students and students from institutions with limited research capacity - in the U.S. science and engineering workforce. Developing and managing an internship program is a complex undertaking, especially for geoscience internship programs that often involve fieldwork. This award creates a central network that supports the efforts of Geosciences (GEO) REU program leaders at over sixty institutions and provides professional development for participating REU interns. The REU program leaders will benefit from the experience and insight of others in the GEO REU Network, including the project leads and other experts. The Network leaders will provide just-in-time resources, strategies, and tools for GEO REU PIs as they navigate recruiting and selecting students, preparing mentors, setting expectations, and addressing student engagement challenges in their programs. They will provide REU leads with individual support and recruit students from underrepresented communities, community colleges, and primarily undergraduate institutions at scientific meetings. The PIs of this project will offer career development workshops for all GEO REU interns during the summer, which directly contributes to the preparation of the geoscience workforce. These efforts will support the community of practice among the internship leads and augment the efficacy of REU programs. \r\n\r\nThe geoscience community hosts internships, Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs), with the intention of providing students with valuable education and of bringing undergraduate scholars from a wide range of backgrounds into the geosciences. Developing and managing an effective, inclusive internship is a challenging year-round undertaking. The GEO REU Network will provide support to all GEO REU leaders and students through fostering the exchange of tools, strategies, and experiences within the community, developing resources, and providing professional development that aligns with the REU Program goals. An overarching theme has been to encourage the adoption of inclusive REU practices and processes. These involve designing accessible and inclusive REUs that take into account and even examine biases and privilege in application and selection processes. The project will advance community understanding of the pedagogy of student research and of inclusive practices, and it will enhance a sense of collaboration among REU PIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
