 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 5th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Privacy and Security in Intelligent Systems, and Applications (IEEE TPS 2023) is an international multidisciplinary forum for presentation of state-of-the art innovations, and discussion among academic/industry researchers, policy makers, and practitioners on issues related to trust, privacy, and security in emerging smart and intelligent\r\nsystems and applications. It will be held in Atlanta, on November 1-3, 2023 and is co-located with the 9th IEEE Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (IEEE CIC 2023), and the 5th International Conference on Cognitive Machine Intelligence (IEEE CogMI 2023). \r\n\r\nThis award supports students to attend IEEE TPS 2023 (and also have access to co-located conferences, IEEE CogMI 2023 and IEEE CIC 2023). The travel awards benefit primarily students from underrepresented groups and those who are in early\r\nstages of their research. Participating students are (1) exposed to research problems discussed by established researchers, (2) have the opportunity to interact and network with other researchers, and 3) benefit from a special student mentoring session where highly successful researchers, or role models in the field, will provide mentoring guidance to the supported students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
