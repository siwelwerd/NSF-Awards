 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to The Morton Arboretum (Lisle, Illinois) will support the training of eight students during ten week intensive summer programs from 2024-2026. We recruit students nationally, emphasizing students traditionally excluded from research due to ethnic or gender identity, who attend schools without research programs, or are first-generation college. Essentially, students come to realize the power and benefit of trees in people\u2019s lives. Their research is often incorporated into programming that reaches our million plus visitors and contributes to policy making. Students gain confidence to pursue a scientific career and their increased tree awareness fills vital gaps in national knowledge about tree biology. Students develop technical skills in a specific field, hone communication and interpretation abilities, create a strong identity and competency as a professional researcher, bond with a diverse cohort of scientific peers, and establish enduring relationships with their CTS collaborators. Assessment of the program will be done through the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be required to register in the NSF ETAP system (etap.nsf.gov) and tracked after the program to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nThe REU site program based in the Center for Tree Science (CTS) at the Morton Arboretum entitled \u201cIntegrative Tree Science for the Anthropocene\u201d aims to: i) provide transformative research experiences in a multidisciplinary setting, ii) inspire a diverse and inclusive community of students and mentors to create the scientific advances necessary so trees and society benefit equitably and sustainably, and iii) expand student awareness of diverse career opportunities and facilitate professional advancement in tree-related research through exposure to the multi-faceted world of botanical gardens. Students partner with mentors to conduct a research project, from initial design to final symposium presentation, aimed at understanding how trees and forests respond and adapt to emerging global environments. Students receive professional development training covering ethics, science communication, diversity and inclusion, and career advancement. Benefiting from the Arboretum\u2019s rich professional and cultural environment, students engage with youth volunteers, exchange visits with interns at other regional training programs, and meet diverse professionals through career awareness activities. More information about the program is available by visiting https://mortonarb.org/science/opportunities-in-science/research-experiences-for-undergraduates-program/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
