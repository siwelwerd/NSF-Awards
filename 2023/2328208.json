 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wide and ultrawide bandgap (WBG/UWBG) power semiconductor devices have significant benefits in a variety of applications from electric vehicles to grid-interface power electronics. However, these systems are subject to a number of challenges and bottlenecks. Notably, WBG devices typically operate at high-voltages, often in floating or isolated domains; they also require high-frequency and accurate control and, importantly, a means to power floating and isolated gate drivers. However, conventional isolated gate drivers rely on electromagnetic isolation which scales poorly to small size, is expensive, lossy, and prone to electromagnetic interference. This work will address the needs of future high-voltage (HV), harsh-environment power electronics for isolated power transfer such as can be used for WBG/UWBG gate drivers as well as associated sensors, transducers, and embedded controllers. Specifically, this project will develop platforms which use integrated/isolated optical-wireless power transfer as a means to deliver both power and data (for control, feedback, and fault detection) in future HV power electronics. Smaller, faster, optically isolated power and signal interfaces may have broader impacts in a range of modern power and energy systems from renewable energy and electrified transportation to performance computing and communications infrastructure. The project will also provide workforce development through training of graduate and undergraduate students in critical areas of need, integration of research and teaching, and connecting research to k-12 students and the general public through organized dissemination and outreach.\r\n\r\nThe project will be completed by an interdisciplinary team that leverages skills in semiconductor design, optics and photonics, power electronics, and integrated circuits. The project is designed to maximize synergies and explore challenges at the boundaries of these disciplines. Specifically, in this proposal we will 1) study and optimize single- and multi-chip photovoltaic-mode optical power and signal receivers with high-efficiency monochromatic isolated power transfer; 2) develop nanophotonics and package structures that can improve photon capture via light trapping and photon recycling; 3) design a pseudo-adiabatic switched capacitor gate-driver that can increase optoelectronic system efficiency, reduce overall gate-drive power, and provide local control, diagnostics, and communication; 4) develop kV-level isolated packaging, integration, and assembly schemes that combine OPT and IC functions; 5) complete a final system demonstration of a HV hybrid switched capacitor DC-DC converter prototype. By using a system approach, we aim to show that optical power combined with specifically tailored, integrated electronics can increase efficiency, while reducing size, and enable new directions and opportunities in high-voltage and harsh-environment power and energy systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
