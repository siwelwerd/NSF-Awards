 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Second U.S.-Korea Synthetic Biology Conference will focus on the latest advances in synthetic biology research and applications, bringing together key stakeholders from academic institutions in the United States and Republic of Korea. The conference includes talks on a variety of areas of synthetic biology research, and includes group discussions such as biofoundries and the bioeconomy, advancing synthetic biology education, and using synthetic biology to address global grand challenges. As a consequence of these interactions, the conference creates a unique environment for diverse researchers from the United States and Korea to gather and exchange ideas. The conference also provides a venue for discussing synthetic biology research in agriculture, biotechnology and climate change mitigation. Furthermore, the conference aims to give students and early career professionals opportunities to share their work, to network with the foremost leaders in the field, and to develop their careers.\r\n\r\nSynthetic biology has enormous potential to revolutionize medicine, agriculture, biotechnology, and energy usage. By sharing knowledge and expertise at the Second U.S.-Korea Synthetic Biology Conference, scientists in the United States and South Korea will advance their research programs in synthetic biology and increase their potential to contribute to these sectors and to the bioeconomy. The conference gathers an interdisciplinary audience to share technical presentations on cutting edge synthetic biology research and applications, and to network and develop relationships for future collaborations. Attendees include leaders in the field, established researchers, early career professionals and trainees who will lead the field in the coming decades. The conference aims to generate promising new approaches in synthetic biology research and to identify key research milestones in synthetic biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
