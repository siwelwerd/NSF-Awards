 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasing severity and occurrence of cyberattacks, data breaches, and security vulnerabilities have led to a high demand for individuals with strong cybersecurity skills. Utilizing real-world cyber breaches as case studies in classrooms can improve student learning, foster innovation in cybersecurity education, and bridge the gap between university education and industry needs. These cases can generate genuine interest in cybersecurity among students and attract more individuals to the field, helping to build the cybersecurity workforce. Furthermore, cyber case studies offer experiential learning, where students can apply classroom knowledge to real world scenarios. Lastly, they can prepare students to better meet industry needs by offering a comprehensive understanding of enterprise security and complex socio-technical components such as human and business factors.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a new framework called CASE (Case Analysis for Security Education), which aims to systematically explore the use of case studies in cybersecurity education. By dissecting and analyzing real-world cyber breaches and vulnerabilities, students will gain insight into the entire cyberattack process, from start to finish. Students will learn about relevant security topics and tactics, how to secure networks and systems, and how to prevent or respond to attacks. Additionally, students will be able to replicate certain breaches and vulnerabilities in virtual lab platforms utilizing comparable tools and methods as detailed in real-world scenarios. Through guided hands-on lab challenges centered around the case studies, students will explore a variety of offensive and defensive techniques in cybersecurity, develop a holistic understanding of cyber systems, and acquire knowledge of best practices through real-world scenarios. The project outcomes will consist of a repository of real-world cyber breach case studies, as well as a collection of hands-on and virtual lab platforms that enable students to replicate cyber cases.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
