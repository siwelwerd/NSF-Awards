 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides participant support for the Spring Lecture Series (SLS) on \"Transport, mixing and fluids\" at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Arkansas, on May 5-7, 2023. The SLS has a rich history of bringing together junior and established researchers in cutting edge areas of mathematics and statistics with the goal of educating and elevating the next generation of talent. Turbulent mixing is a subject of broad importance in physics, engineering, geosciences and mathematics. Over the course of five lecturers, the principal speaker for the series, Anna Mazzucato, will introduce fundamental elements of the mathematical study of turbulent mixing and present state of the art results. Additionally, there will be ten one-hour lectures by invited speakers on related topics as well as a poster session by young researchers. A career panel will be included to foster the career development of junior participants. Finally, a public lecture presented by Lisette de Pillis will present the art and applications of mathematical modeling at a level suited to a broad audience. \r\n\r\nWhen a tracer is carried by a turbulent incompressible flow, it is rapidly dispersed throughout the fluid medium, that is, it becomes mixed. This dynamic is important to many areas of research, including atmospheric and oceanographic science, biology, and chemistry. Recently, major mathematical developments have improved society's understanding of mixing. These advances connect disciplines within analysis, namely partial differential equations (PDE), dynamical systems, and geometric measure theory. Results of this progress have been used to explore other problems in the analysis of PDE, such as the loss of regularity for transport equations. The lectures will present the mathematical fundamentals behind these processes as well as advanced results by the principal and invited speakers in order to provide participants with a broad and current perspective on the field. More information is available at https://fulbright.uark.edu/departments/math/research/spring-lecture-series/index.php\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
