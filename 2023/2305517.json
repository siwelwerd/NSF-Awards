 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Regional Innovation Engines Development Award is focused on catalyzing efforts among industrial, academic, economic development, state, and community organizations to accelerate the integration of intelligent technologies throughout north Mississippi's diverse manufacturing sector. The project team, nicknamed Engine 662, is a coalition of the region's research universities, community colleges, and industry partners, all focused on improving efficiency and productivity, developing new technologies, upskilling the workforce, fueling startups, attracting new industries, and helping existing industries grow. This initiative represents a significant opportunity to improve economic outcomes throughout the region. At the project's core are stakeholders who understand all parties' inherent connections and roles in driving a vibrant economy for all Mississippians. North Mississippi relies heavily on manufacturing across multiple sectors and is poised for rapid growth. Engine 662 supports heightened coordination among partners to leverage resources and innovate solutions to drive and sustain growth. Engine 662 will promote an advanced manufacturing ecosystem, positioning Mississippi for a more significant share of the technological revolution and enhancing U.S. industrial competitiveness.\r\n \r\nTo actualize use-inspired research in advanced manufacturing, Engine 662 will pilot New Product Blueprinting (NPB) and Competitiveness Reviews (CR) to identify gaps and commonalities to define initial research thrusts. Engine 662 will address gaps in technologies, products, workforce training, ecosystem coordination, and translation of new technologies to commercialization. Based on data from the NPB and CR, the project will prioritize resources and connect problems with teams trained to develop solutions rapidly. As barriers to employment are uncovered, the project will work with community colleges, K-12 schools, and regional economic development associations to replicate what works or design new solutions. Central to Engine 662's success is understanding the challenges shared by industries (use-inspired R&D), leveraging stakeholders' capacities, and enhancing regional coordination (ecosystem development). Engine 662 provides a platform and vehicle for coordination among project leadership and regional stakeholders to organize an effective, inclusive, diverse, and committed team that understands how to maximize and deploy all available resources and pilot new approaches to use-inspired research that prioritize regional R&D needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
