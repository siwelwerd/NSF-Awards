 "awd_abstract_narration": "he broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop an autonomous, robotic inspection system to eliminate manual inspection methods in confined and dangerous spaces. The innovation will use a robot to provide quantitative condition and emissions data for an estimated 150,000 floating roof tanks in the nation\u2019s aging infrastructure. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and similar agencies across the globe, require tanks to be routinely inspected, but companies also want to remove personnel from confined spaces and avoid exposure to poisonous gasses, asphyxiation, heat exhaustion, falling accidents, etc. Confined space entries caused 1,300 U.S. deaths between 2011 and 2018. The autonomous robot reduces expenses related to maintenance and repair and allows better quantitative assessment of the seal integrity, which allows companies to perform maintenance based on the asset condition and not frequency-based schedules. An industry trend in recent years is to recreate the state of their assets digitally - both visually and quantitatively. The high-resolution data provided through this effort supports these 'digital twins.' Also, once the robot is certified for explosive environments, design features can be reused to produce other robots which further improve development cost and safety. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project will create an autonomous robotic inspection system which eliminates manual, confined-space inspection methods and requires only one technician to deploy the robot from the top of the tank wall. The wall-climbing robot is capable of inspecting both the floating-roof storage tank\u2019s upper (weather) and lower (primary) seals using a bifurcated (inverse periscope) geometry which places sensors in the gap between the seals while prime movers, adhesion elements, and a controller are above the seals. The bifurcated design simplifies safety feature design by minimizing the size and complexity of device components between the seals. The bifurcated design enables the continuous use of a tether for isolating the power source and provides a positive pressure surge system. After insertion, the robot proceeds to circumnavigate the inner tank shell in a stable manner, overcoming the large frictional forces that exist between the tank wall and the upper seal. The robotic system gathers real-time, high-resolution, and continuous data about the state of the seals. High-resolution visual data characterizes the top of the seal, and a proprietary physical \u201cfeeler\u201d mechanism characterizes the seal gap. This information results in a fast, safe, and accurate inspection of the tank\u2019s seal.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The robot is engineered to operate safely in these environments containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), thereby eliminating the need for human inspectors to enter these dangerous areas. The system addresses the challenge of operating in explosive atmospheres while delivering highly accurate inspection data, ensuring tank integrity, environmental safety, and regulatory compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merits:</strong> The project advanced robotics technology for hazardous environments by experimenting with and integrating several protection methodologies into the design, which serve to prevent an ignitable concentration of flammable gases from entering the robot&rsquo;s body. These features are important steps in the robot&rsquo;s certification journey for use in Class 1, Division 1 environments, a rating that very few off-the-shelf robots currently offer. While full certification is still in progress, Pike has made significant strides in meeting the safety requirements necessary for operation in these high-risk environments. The robotic platform also features magnetic adhesion for stable navigation on curved steel surfaces, even in the presence of oil or grime. Its compact design and light weight allow it to easily pass through small area manways, while the offset sensor package enables it to reach previously inaccessible areas of the tank&rsquo;s roof to gather critical inspection data.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> This technology has substantial broader impacts, particularly in improving industrial safety, environmental protection, and operational efficiency. By eliminating the need to send human inspectors into VOC-filled environments, the robot greatly reduces the risk of accidents. It also enables more frequent and comprehensive inspections, allowing earlier detection of potential issues and better compliance with safety and environmental regulations. The ability to conduct in-service inspections without shutting down tanks provides significant cost savings, potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in avoided downtime. Additionally, preventing tank shutdowns eliminates the need for degassing procedures, which release harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This reduction in emissions represents a major environmental benefit. Moreover, the robot generates storable video feeds of inspections, providing energy companies with valuable documentation to demonstrate compliance with regulations, particularly in defending against potential fines.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Outcomes:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Progress Toward Explosive Atmosphere Certification:</strong> While the robot is not yet fully certified, Pike has made significant progress in achieving explosive atmosphere safety by integrating purge and pressurization systems that maintain positive pressure to prevent the ingress of flammable gases. These systems were successfully tested for over 90 minutes, proving their reliability for sustained operation in VOC-filled tanks over the course of the inspection mission. Further testing is ongoing with the selected certifying body.</p>\n<p><strong>Compact Navigation and Offset Sensor Package:</strong> The robot&rsquo;s compact design and light weight allows it to pass through small area manways, and the novel arrangement of magnets ensures successful adhesion to curved, steel surfaces. The offset sensor package enables the robot to access previously unreachable areas of the tank roof, ensuring comprehensive inspections and providing data that would be very difficult to collect with current methods. This innovative design ensures efficient movement inside confined spaces and correct placement of the sensors.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Data Analysis, Feeler Probe Deployment, and Regulatory Compliance:</strong> The robot combines color and point cloud data collection and analysis with a feeler probe to physically measure seal gaps and fabric tears. This dual approach enhances the accuracy and thoroughness of inspections, allowing the robot to detect both visible and hidden defects. The robot also stores a video feed of each inspection, which energy companies can archive to demonstrate compliance with safety and environmental regulations, offering critical protection against potential fines.</p>\n<p><strong>Field Testing and Commercial Potential: </strong>Five field tests were conducted at customer sites, validating the robot&rsquo;s performance in real-world environments. These tests confirmed the robot&rsquo;s ability to navigate complex tank interiors and collect high-quality data, while also highlighting its commercial viability. Industry interest is strong, with multiple letters of support from stakeholders, positioning the robot as a safer, more efficient alternative to traditional inspection methods.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Phase 1 successfully advanced the development of a compact, explosion-rated robot for performing in-service inspections in hazardous environments. Although full certification for explosive atmospheres is still in progress, the project made significant strides in integrating several protection methodologies and testing them in operational environments. The robot&rsquo;s offset sensor package and feeler probe allow it to gather accurate data from previously inaccessible areas, while its storable video feed supports companies in maintaining regulatory compliance and avoiding costly fines. By enabling inspections without tank shutdowns, the robot also helps companies save money and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As we move into Phase 2, the focus will be on achieving full certification and refining the system for broader commercial deployment, establishing this technology as a transformative solution for industrial inspections in explosive atmospheres.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Connor&nbsp;Crawford</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div
