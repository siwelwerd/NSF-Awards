 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports student travel for selected students to attend the Sixth Conference on Machine Learning and Systems (MLSys 2023), which will be held at the Miami Convention Center in Florida, United States, June 4th to 8th, 2023. MLSys focuses on research at the intersection of machine learning and systems. It aims to elicit new connections amongst these fields, including identifying best practices and design principles for learning systems, as well as developing novel learning methods and theory tailored to practical machine learning workflows. Students will benefit from the opportunity to engage in the technical, professional, educational and social exchanges that MLSys fosters.\r\n\r\nGraduate and undergraduate student attendance is vital to the growth of the MLSys community. This grant helps to sustain student participation, particularly those from institutions where travel funds may not otherwise be available. Emphasis will be given to directing support towards underrepresented minorities, including women, African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Native Pacific Islanders. Students will have the opportunity to interact with mentors and peers of varying gender, ethnicity and background. Support will increase the attendance of talented undergraduate students, attracting them to graduate studies and future research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
