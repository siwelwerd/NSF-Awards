 "awd_abstract_narration": "A group of multidisciplinary researchers from the George Washington University, Georgetown University, North Carolina State University, Trinity College, and City University of Hong Kong have developed a two-day conference in New Frontiers in Reliability and Risk Analysis to be held at the Science and Engineering Hall of the George Washington University on October 13-14, 2023. The conference will focus on modern statistical methodologies of Reliability and Risk Analysis, which have a broad appeal, with applications in a vast array of disciplines such as engineering, science, business, medicine, law, healthcare and the social sciences. The conference organizers encourage participation and attendance by early-career researchers with diverse backgrounds and researchers from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe conference will be emphasizing presentation of topics on novel application areas and modern theoretical developments such as Adversarial Risk Analysis, Fusion Learning in Survival Analysis, Big Data in Reliability, Financial Risk Analytics, Machine Learning in Risk Analysis, and Deep and Reinforcement Learning in Reliability and Risk Analysis, Block Chains and Reliability, and Bayesian Learning and Decision Making with Big Data. The conference will feature key plenary speakers. For more specific and up to date conference details, interested parties are referred to the conference website: statistics.columbian.gwu.edu/nds2023.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
