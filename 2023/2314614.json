 "awd_abstract_narration": "Power dissipation and energy consumption are a key limiting factor in the future scalability of present computing technologies based on silicon field-effect transistors. Due to their potential for a low switching energy, spintronic devices that leverage the spin of electrons to carry information instead of their charge have long been pursued as an alternative approach, both for digital computing and analog devices. However, realizing the potential of spintronic devices requires overcoming a few basic challenges. First, weak spin-orbit coupling in conventional spintronic materials such as GaAs necessitates transport of electrons over large devices to allow control of the spin. In contrast, using a material with high spin-orbit coupling to make smaller devices leads to rapid loss of spin information due to dephasing: spins rapidly rotating and becoming out of phase with each other. The PIs propose to address these two challenges by leveraging materials with a special class of spin behavior called the persistent spin helix, where electron spins remain in phase even when rotating rapidly, enabling spin information to be retained longer even in high spin-orbit materials. Specifically, by using electric-field tunable persistent spin helix in van der Waals solids with strong spin-orbit coupling, the PIs propose to enable a new class of materials for spintronic devices, where the spin behavior can be sensitively controlled by electric fields and where the device dimensions can be reduced by two to three orders of magnitude due to the significantly stronger spin-orbit coupling. This would help innovate the design of competitive spin field-effect transistors for high-performance and low-power computing. This award also aims to promote research training to historically underrepresented groups in the rapidly growing field of spintronic materials and devices, and thereby contribute to both the technical knowhow and workforce for the development of future microelectronics.\r\n\r\nThe PIs propose to understand the effect of electric field-tuned symmetry and Hamiltonian on the spin texture, spin dynamics, and spin transport of square van der Waals crystals with strong spin-orbit coupling for spintronic devices. With the square symmetry of the basal plane and natural quantum well structures of selected materials, when an external electric field is applied along desired crystallographic orientations, persistent spin helix-type spin-orbit field is expected. With persistent spin helix states and strong spin-orbit coupling, the PIs expect to achieve electric field/electric voltage-switchable symmetry-protected long-range coherent spin transport. The model materials include air-stable, lithography-friendly van der Waals crystals Bi2O2Se and BiOI, and the model devices include persistent spin helix-based spin field effect transistors. The proposed approach for enabling and tuning persistent spin helix does not require careful balance between Rashba and Dresselhaus fields commonly seen in III-V. This makes the proposed model systems a robust platform for exploring spin field effect transistor. The PIs will grow single crystalline orientation-controlled spintronic tetragonal van der Waals semiconductors and fabricate persistent spin helix-based field effect transistors. The PIs will computationally predict and experimentally reveal the spin-polarized band structure, and dynamics and wavelength of persistent spin helix in the model materials and devices. The PIs will also demonstrate the proof-of-concept persistent spin helix-based field effect transistors and reveal the effects of device structure/dimension, gate dielectrics, external voltage/polarization, and temperature on the characteristics and performance of the spin field effect transistor.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
