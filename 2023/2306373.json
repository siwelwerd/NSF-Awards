 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mesophotic Coral Reefs are deep reefs (~100-500 ft depths) that exist below the depth limits of most stressors impacting shallow coral reefs. As such, there is hope that these deep reefs might represent a \u201clifeboat\u201d for species that can reseed shallow reefs to ensure their survival. Although the biodiversity of these deep reefs is well examined, many recent significant studies address the ecology, evolution, and management of these unique reefs. The 2nd Gordon Research Conference on Mesophotic Coral Reefs provides a forum where the leading scientists, and future scientists, focused on these questions can compare data, techniques, and site-specific differences to increase our understanding of deep reefs, and their role in coral reef resilience. Funds from this project support the inclusion of early-career researchers. \r\n\r\nMesophotic Coral Reefs (MCRs) are increasingly studied in the context of a refugia for a variety of broadly-distributed reef species that are impacted by stressors. However, there is also evidence that some MCR species have distinct populations with unique molecular and physiological adaptations along a shallow to deep depth gradient.  While MCRs are frequently the subject of opportunistic exploration and sampling, recent advanced studies within these ecosystems address fundamental questions regarding the ecology, physiology, and evolutionary biology of species living within this steep gradient of abiotic factors. The theme of the 2nd MCRE GRC will be the changing scientific questions and techniques, that are rapidly transforming our understanding of MCR processes and their broader role in coral reef biomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
