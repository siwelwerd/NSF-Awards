 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Vassar College to acquire a confocal microscope to enhance research and teaching in the New York Mid-Hudson Valley region, including at Marist College and at the State University of New York at New Paltz. This microscope will create new STEM research opportunities for undergraduates, especially those from underrepresented groups, by enhancing ongoing and future research projects and by facilitating programs across disciplines aimed at increasing student diversity in STEM. Microscopy-focused community outreach events, such as a \u201cscience cafe\u201d to informally present research to the broader community, will highlight the importance of basic biological research to an inclusive audience. The microscope will enhance an already vibrant life sciences consortium in the Mid-Hudson Valley, creating a regional resource that builds community and brings together neighboring institutions and a diversity of students for cutting-edge scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nThis award will fundamentally transform faculty research, faculty-mentored undergraduate research, and advanced-level teaching in the New York Mid-Hudson Valley region. The breadth of the capabilities of this confocal microscope includes the ability to image biological structures at high resolution and in 3-dimensions, from molecules to living organisms. The microscope will be a widely-used, multi-purpose device that augments the capabilities of numerous researchers in a diverse range of disciplines, including biochemistry, cell biology, developmental biology, microbiology, molecular biology, neuroscience, and psychological science. The microscope will also be incorporated into the classroom, including \u201chands-on\u201d laboratory courses at both Vassar College and Marist College. Through undergraduate research and training, this award provides a state-of-the-art confocal microscopy platform for training the next generation of scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
