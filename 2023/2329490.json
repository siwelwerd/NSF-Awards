 "awd_abstract_narration": "The teacher-scholar model for higher education is common among faculty at regional colleges and universities and primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), yet most faculty have spent their immediate time after graduate school as postdoctoral researchers advancing scholarship at larger research institutions. Because of this, the approximately 66,000 current postdoctoral scholars have minimal opportunities to improve their teaching and to learn to manage the teaching and research expectations at regional institutions and PUIs, schools that the vast majority of students attend. The teacher-scholar model may provide postdoctoral scholars with better training for the diverse type of positions available for those with a Ph.D., especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and STEM education disciplines. This type of training can also be of significance in increasing the diversity of tenure-track faculty because persons excluded due to ethnicity and race (PEERs) are those most likely to pursue non-STEM jobs after obtaining a STEM degree. The project involves a multifaceted approach to transform STEM postdoctoral training for a cohort of four postdoctoral Fellows. Through the program, Fellows become independent scholars who have obtained skills in pedagogy, teaching, writing, and mentorship, all of which can later translate to positions at regional institutions, PUIs, larger research institutions, and industry. \r\n\r\nThrough a teacher-scholar model, PROGRESS Fellows engage in ongoing STEM education research at a regional PUI and develop their own, independent research program building their research expertise, skills, and competencies to engage in impactful STEM and STEM education scholarship. Additionally, PROGRESS includes a multitiered approach to mentorship to help appropriately develop postdoctoral Fellows. Using qualitative and quantitative surveys, self-assessments and annual reviews, and teaching evaluations, the program goals include the generation of novel data on 1) factors that contribute to a sense of belonging in academia for postdoctoral scholars that identify as women and PEERs, 2) professional development activities that contribute to PEERs\u2019 career decision self-efficacy, and 3) the role of the teacher-scholar model for postdoctoral training.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) program that aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied research that advances knowledge within the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
