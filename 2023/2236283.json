 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing blockchain learning modules to improve cybersecurity education for both computer science and non-computer science students. The remarkable growth of cybersecurity threats affirms the importance of engaging undergraduate students in adaptive hands-on learning-based education. The current number of highly skilled professionals in the cybersecurity market does not align with the increasing growth of cybersecurity threats. In addition, blockchain technology, as a vital component of cybersecurity markets, is expected to have a massive impact on both the public and private sectors. Broadening curricula and providing hands-on learning practices for undergraduate STEM students will help address the need for well-prepared professionals in blockchain technology. The project intends to implement innovative learning strategies and resources to enhance blockchain and cybersecurity education by leveraging existing NSF cyberinfrastructure resources and hands-on lab experiences. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to improve student learning outcomes associated with blockchain technology. The proposed strategies will include several activities: 1) integrating open-ended design along with evidence-based and knowledge-generating experiences into lab experiments, 2) accomplishing teamwork in flexible and portable labs, 3) creating online and in-person learning communities, and 4) overcoming the isolation of single location experiments to make possible multi-domain interactions. In addition to designing a new course for blockchain and cybersecurity, the project team plans to develop and integrate experiential online learning modules into several existing courses. The developed courses and learning modules have the potential to generate new knowledge of how NSF-funded cyberinfrastructure resources can be easily and efficiently used in cybersecurity education through blockchain labs. The project team plans to disseminate the developed modules to faculty development workshops and STEM camps for high school students to broaden participation in computing. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
