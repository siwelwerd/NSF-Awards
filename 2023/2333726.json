 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching aim of this NSF Proto-Open Knowledge Network (Proto-OKN) Theme 1 OKN Use Case project is to develop a Water-Energy Nexus Open Knowledge Network (WEN-OKN) that will achieve two primary tasks: firstly, it will interconnect currently siloed water-energy data by creating a densely interconnected knowledge graph (KG); secondly, it will aid in recognizing and dealing with the complex interconnections within the water-energy nexus, particularly those currently unexplored, which can potentially trigger cascading failures. WEN-OKN will pave the way to an integrated, systems-based approach to manage the water-energy nexus nationally. WEN-OKN will connect datasets sourced from a host of federal agencies, such as the United States Geological Survey (USGS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Energy (DOE), United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Transportation (DOT), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Simultaneously, it will encourage connectivity both internally and externally, through the facilitation of data sharing across and within agencies. Once successful, WEN-OKN will become a vital part of the National data infrastructure, laying a strong foundation for analytical studies and sustainable management of U.S. water and energy resources and infrastructure. It will play a crucial role in both immediate disaster response and mitigation, and future planning scenarios. By granting open access to high-quality, integrated data, WEN-OKN will facilitate decisive actions at the water-energy nexus and enable targeted responses to climate threats. WEN-OKN fosters a collaborative environment for various stakeholders to co-create a public solutions-oriented tool, paving the way for an ethically driven socio-technical approach to decision-making at the water-energy nexus.\r\n\r\nThis project's intellectual merit lies in its capacity to meaningfully connect water and energy data across multiple non-interoperable sectors through WEN-OKN, facilitating inquiries at the water-energy nexus. With diverse input from federal and state governments, industry professionals, experts and specialists, the WEN-OKN addresses the convergent, big data challenge of managing the water-energy nexus, offering flexibility and extensibility over time. This open knowledge network ensures data and knowledge are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR), enabling stakeholders from various domains to contribute, share, and access information. The project is expected to enhance water and energy resilience, reduce future climate and land use threats, and promote inter- and intra-agency collaboration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
