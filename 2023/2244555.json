 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Oceanography at Texas A&M University will host a REU Site: Observing the Ocean (REU-OTO). Each summer, the program will offer ten students an opportunity to participate in research to investigate issues facing the coastal ocean, including hypoxia, harmful algae, oil spills, climate-induced hydrographic changes, and ocean acidification. Recruitment will target rising sophomores and juniors in marine science, engineering, math, physics, biology, and chemistry with a focus on students from underrepresented groups who may not have considered oceanography as a career. A balanced suite of ocean data acquisition and analytical skills will be provided by incorporating training on data analysis from well-established in situ ocean observing equipment, shipboard field surveys with CTD profiling, as well as water sampling with lab-based and/or computer modeling-based analytical skills. A field research project in the Gulf of Mexico aboard the R/V Pelican will provide samples, enhance teamwork, promote understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of oceanography, and emphasize the value of time series in ocean observing. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this REU program is to strengthen undergraduate STEM education and retention by providing (1) an interdisciplinary research experience to challenge and engage students; (2) strong mentorship and professional development training; and (3) strategies to develop effective scientific communication skills. REU students working with faculty mentors will develop and complete a research project using ocean observing techniques. Students will learn how to pose a research question, generate hypotheses, conduct research, and assess the state of the ocean. Activities will foster students\u2019 sense of discovery through hands-on, practical experiences with cutting-edge oceanographic observing techniques. Technical workshops on coding/data analysis, graphical representation of oceanographic data, data management, science writing, and professional development will be provided weekly to enrich skillsets beyond the individual lab-based mentorship. REU students will participate in a research trip aboard the R/V Pelican to map hypoxia and other biogeochemical tracers along a repeat transect, where they will learn how to observe the ocean using CTDs and towed ocean sensors and how to collect and analyze hydrographic samples. To improve oral communication, students will present during weekly REU seminars and give a departmental seminar presentation at program end; the winner of the best student presentation will receive a travel award to present at a national conference. To demonstrate writing skills, the students will write an initial research proposal and prepare either a final poster or written report.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
