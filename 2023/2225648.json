 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities for their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. The sustainability of gains achieved in building capacity are significantly enhanced by retaining talented and credentialed STEM faculty. This project aligns directly with that goal.\r\n\r\nUnited Tribes Technical College (UTTC) is transforming its STEM programs through a comprehensive project focusing on enhanced recruitment, retention, and completion of students in fisheries and wildlife biology. By building upon tested STEM education models and innovating new methods for integrating research and culture throughout degree programs, the project will have significant impact institutionally and will provide models for broad dissemination. The program fosters an inclusive and culturally congruent environment that supports critical transition points from high school to college and into the workforce. The goals of this project at UTTC's project are to 1) increase interest in and readiness for postsecondary STEM studies at UTTC; 2) establish a Fisheries and Wildlife Bachelor of Science Degree emphasizing instructional transformation, research integration, cultural congruency, and workforce pathway; and 3) increase STEM faculty development and community engagement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
