 "awd_abstract_narration": "The gravitational wave (GW) spectrum spans many orders of magnitude in frequency, with sources ranging from stellar-mass compact objects to supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) at the centers of distant galaxies. GW astronomy is a key component of one of NSF\u2019s 10 big ideas (\u201cwindows on the Universe\u201d), which aims to combine electromagnetic, GW, and neutrino observations to study astrophysical phenomena. Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) probe the low-frequency portion of the GW spectrum (f \u223c 1 \u2212 100 nHz), which is inaccessible to either ground-based or space-based interferometers. The purpose of this award is to support the development of techniques to detect GWs from individual SMBBHs with PTAs. . This award will also support the development of a planetarium show to share PTA science with the public, and a GW activity for undergraduate students that will act as an introduction to astrophysics research.\r\n\r\nThis award will support the development of robust frequentist detection techniques for individual SMBBHs, which will complement existing Bayesian methods. The group will also investigate ways of optimizing PTAs to detect GWs from individual SMBBHs. These advances will improve the ability to detect GWs from individual SMBBHs with PTAs and enable multi-messenger astrophysics of SMBBHs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
