 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation supports vessels dedicated to oceanographic research in the Arctic. Conducting successful research cruises on these ships requires scientists (particularly those in supervisory roles on the survey trips \u2013 or \u201cchief scientists\u201d) to understand the planning and logistics of how to request time on ships, how to coordinate personnel and equipment, how to plan for operations and survey tasks at sea, and how to work with vessel crew and staff \u2013 as well as how to deal with unexpected issues which may arise. To maintain a robust scientific workforce that can effectively request, plan, and lead this type of work, early career scientists need to gain training and experience, with consideration for the unique challenges of work the Arctic, such as planning survey routes through sea ice. There is a particular need for this training and capacity-building at the present time, given increasing interest in Arctic research and a lag in research cruises (and thus junior scientist training) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project will host up to 12 early career participants on a week-long R/V Sikuliaq transit between Seward and Nome, AK. Participants will participate in virtual pre-cruise meetings, a one-day pre-cruise workshop, and diverse training modules on the cruise to develop proficiency, build confidence, and become part of an early career arctic oceanographer cohort. \r\n\r\nThis project will implement an early career chief scientist training cruise onboard the R/V Sikuliaq in Alaskan waters to help train a new generation of oceanographers who have the skills and confidence to lead these types of expeditions. Participants will be recruited through an advertisement process and will be introduced to the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF), the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), and cruise planning and logistics through several virtual pre-cruise meetings prior to the training cruise. Participants will have the opportunity to plan their cruise sampling, communicate plans with the vessel crew, and arrange for mobilization of any required supplies. Topics will include strategies for using the Marine Facilities Planning system and the Cruise Planning workflow, learning how to request and use resources from the UNOLS van pool and other community-based vessel equipment and support groups, and how to coordinate and manage shipboard and shore-based personnel. During a pre-cruise one-day shoreside workshop, participants will engage in targeted activities to build leadership and explore interpersonal dynamics prior to boarding. During the cruise, science mentors and vessel scientific staff will provide guidance to participants and lead a series of presentations and group discussions about how to manage a successful marine survey. Participants will have the opportunity to engage in sampling and daily activity planning. After the cruise, participants will ship any samples collected to their home institution, archive data, and create a cruise report. Specific desired outcomes include developing a well-trained seagoing scientific workforce to promote U.S. national interests in the Arctic through oceanographic research on NSF-supported platforms. The project will help to develop a cohort of early career researchers who can become future mentors among the polar science community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
