 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) Symposia, organized by the National Academy of Engineering, provide emerging engineering leaders from academia, industry, and government laboratories the opportunity to share research insights to facilitate an interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge and research methodologies. The nature of emerging technologies and how they fit together to create products and processes that drive economic growth makes it essential that engineers understand research developments, techniques and approaches beyond their own discipline. The FOE symposia serve as a catalyst to spur engineering innovation and foster collaborative networks of researchers within the United States and between engineers from the United States and partnering countries. The FOE program has the potential to benefit society both by supporting innovation and by increasing the visibility of engineering and the important ways in which engineers serve society.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide partial support for four Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) symposia, to be held in 2023. These symposia, organized by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in concert with international partner organizations, are for early career researchers. The meetings to be funded by this award in 2023 are: German-American FOE (March, 2023; J\u00fclich, Germany); Japan-America FOE (July, 2023; Tokyo, Japan); US FOE (September, 2023; Boulder, CO); and EU-US FOE (October, 2023; Murray Hill, NJ). The 2023 German-American FOE will focus on: Sustainable Production/Circular Economy; The Hydrogen Economy; Neuromorphic Computing; and Supply Chain Resiliency. Topics for the 2023 Japan-America FOE symposium are: Computational Approaches to Address Infectious Diseases; Wearable Robotics; Materials by Design; Circular Economy. The US FOE meeting will address: Engineered Quantum Systems; Mining Resource Extraction/Critical Materials; Combating Disinformation; Complex Systems in the Context of Health Care. The EU-US meeting will cover: The Quantum Era Challenge; Future Challenges in Additive Manufacturing; Green Hydrogen; The Computational Era of Life Sciences. Approximately 100 outstanding young engineers for the U.S. symposium and 30 from each country for the bilateral symposia will participate. Each 2.5 day symposium will include plenary sessions, break-out and poster sessions, and opportunities for developing collaborative research partnerships. Sessions will consist of presentations on cutting-edge research, innovations, and emerging research opportunities in engineering fields relevant to the symposium. FOE symposium papers, abstracts, presentation videos, and slides will be made available on the FOE website (www.naefrontiers.org).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
