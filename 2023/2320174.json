 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation Program and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program. Professors Jay Forsythe, Michael Giuliano, Brooke Van Horn, Wendy Cory, and Yu Gong from College of Charleston will acquire a matrix-assisted laser desorption / ionization \u2013 tandem time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry is a powerful technique to detect and characterize chemical species in sample mixtures. Specifically, MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry is well suited for analyzing molecules of numerous types \u2013 biological polymers, synthetic polymers / plastics, pharmaceuticals, dyes \u2013 and to provide essential information on their structural composition. This instrument will enable new research directions, encourage new collaborations, and boost research training not only for a diverse undergraduate student and researcher population at the College of Charleston but also for students and researchers across the Lowcountry region of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThis award is expected to enhance research and education throughout College of Charleston and beyond. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry involves the conversion of chemical species to gas-phase ions that are accelerated through a field-free region under high vacuum. Ion mass-to-charge (m/z) values are then obtained from flight times. The instrument will provide greater than 10,000 resolving power (full width, half maximum) and low-ppm mass accuracy in reflector TOF mode; these capabilities are critical for a variety of research projects such as the fate(s) of pharmaceuticals in the environment, biocompatible materials, and the structure, function, and evolution of polypeptides. In TOF/TOF acquisition mode, ions in flight are selected and fragmented for structural analysis. Collisions with neutral gas such as argon increase the efficiency of fragmentation and, thus, the level of structural detail. Impacts of this award are far-reaching and include but are not limited to increasing participation of underrepresented persons in research through the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-AMP) program, better preparing students for future careers in clinical, industrial, or R&D labs by providing hands-on training with modern instrumentation, and access for other institutions in the region with no or limited mass spectrometry resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
