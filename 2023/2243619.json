 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding renews a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the\r\nUniversity of Missouri \u2013 Columbia. Undergraduate students will investigate a variety of interesting and\r\nchallenging problems that involve consumer networking applications and services that are of significance\r\nto the economy and quality of life in areas such as social computing, health care, and public safety. The\r\nstudents will participate in the faculty mentors\u2019 on-going funded research, investigate technically\r\nchallenging issues and develop viable solutions and insights. They will participate in professional\r\ndevelopment activities to prepare them for future graduate studies and a broad range of emerging\r\ncomputing careers. The site will focus on recruiting students from non-PhD granting institutions with\r\nparticular emphasis on institutions in and around the state of Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project rests with the leadership, an experienced research group with\r\nexcellent expertise and experience in the research area. The research will focus on broad topics such as:\r\nsoftware-defined networking/virtualization, visual cloud computing, immersive learning with virtual\r\nreality, mobile sensing and environment recognition, securing networked consumer applications, and\r\napplication-aware network performance optimization. The research activities will lead to a better\r\nunderstanding of the multitude of efficiency, performance, reliability, scalability, and security issues and\r\ntradeoffs in consumer networking technologies and related applications. Advanced networking\r\nenvironments and software developed in the previous REU site programs as well as novel testbeds such as\r\nthe Missouri University Science DMZ (demilitarized zone) environment, NSF-supported\r\nCloudLab/FABRIC and Mizzou CAVE, smart device equipment, and sensor-based monitoring will be\r\nleveraged by the participating students in hands-on experiments within their research projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
