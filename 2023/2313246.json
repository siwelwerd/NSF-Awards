 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Midwest Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics (MTSM) Conference is an annual regional meeting for interdisciplinary researchers in thermodynamics. Its format and accessibility present an ideal setting for undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, and early career faculty members from the Midwest to disseminate their work. It will be held on the campus of the University of Notre Dame on June 7-8, 2023. The MTSM Conference has historically provided a forum for researchers working on theoretical and experimental aspects of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics to come together, present their work, and exchange ideas. Most participants will be from chemical engineering and chemistry departments, although students and faculty from physics, materials science, mechanical engineering, and computer science departments have also participated in this conference series.\r\n\r\nThe Midwest Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics Conference brings together a diverse group of thermodynamics researchers for the exchange of new research results and ideas. Research areas include self-assembly, phase transitions, macromolecular dynamics, and macroscopic material properties, encompassing experimental, theoretical, and computational thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. The conference is open to all researchers, though an emphasis is placed on providing a platform for early career researchers to increase the audience for their results, build a network of like-minded investigators, and identify potential collaborative opportunities. Historically, topics of interest have included the prediction of microscopic structure and macroscopic properties of nanomaterials, soft matter, and biological systems, where thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are fundamentally important. Applications to a variety of engineering applications such as energy conversion and storage, environment protection, materials design, synthesis of polymers and nanostructures, and investigation of biomolecules for drug delivery will be presented. This years' conference will be the 32nd held since 1988.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
