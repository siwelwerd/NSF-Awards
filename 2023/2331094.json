 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports six WINS volunteers to participate in SCinet activities in support of the 2023 Supercomputing Conference (SC23) scheduled November 12 - 17, 2023 in Denver, CO.   Volunteers will gain hands on experience in the ground-up construction of the conference network. WINS strives to have a diverse representation of organizations and applicant backgrounds in the group selected each year, with the 2023 group expected to be the most diverse since the start of the program, including many participants from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nWINS volunteers will participate in SCinet, one of the fastest and most advanced computer networks in the world which supports the annual Supercomputing Conference (SC).  Expected outcomes include WINS SC23 volunteers developing new technical skills, gaining exposure to technologies or equipment outside their standard work environment, adding to their professional network, improving collaboration and communication skills, applying the skills developed during SCinet at their home institution, and access to future professional development opportunities.   The travel funded by the proposal will continue the broadening and expansion of knowledge and training for network engineers and information technology professionals who desire to build expertise and continue their education and careers in network and computer systems.  Through this program, the National Science Foundation\u2019s mission is strengthened by opening more training and career opportunities for a diverse workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
