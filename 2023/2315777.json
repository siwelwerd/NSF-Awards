 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by helping transform engineering students into effective learners through the seamless integration of learning skills training into their courses. Effective learning skills are vital in both students\u2019 academic and professional journeys, and they form the foundation for lifelong learning and successful career trajectories in the ever-evolving world of technology. Currently, most engineering curricula are primarily focused on teaching students the technical content, the \u201cwhat\u201d they need to know. This project intends to improve \u201chow\u201d students learn, to have them adopt effective strategies that support the higher-level reasoning required in engineering. To reach this goal and achieve strong transfer outcomes, this project will develop innovative pedagogical approaches to actively train engineering students as effective and self-regulated learners.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to develop and implement learning skill training that is directly integrated into engineering courses, making it an integral part of every student's core educational experience. This course-integrated intervention will be built upon evidence-based practices in engineering pedagogy, cognitive psychology, and teaching and learning interventions. Drawing upon a cognitive science framework of self-regulated learning, it will incorporate evidence-based cognitive learning strategies, meta-cognitive learning strategies, and the cultivation of a growth mindset. Based on this framework, the project will develop, implement, and evaluate learning skill elements that seamlessly integrate into various components of existing courses, including theory, assignments, assessments, and instructional support. Special attention will be given to addressing the needs of students with lower academic performance, underrepresented and underserved groups, and first-generation students, aiming to make a meaningful impact on their educational experiences. Validation of the project's effectiveness will be carried out through its implementation in foundational engineering courses, with the impact assessed by measuring student learning achievements, attitudes, and habits. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
