 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide travel support for 22 U.S.-based undergraduate and graduate students to attend the 32nd Annual Meeting of the North American Membrane Society (NAMS). The meeting will be held in Tuscaloosa, AL, from May 13 to May 17, 2023. The NAMS Annual Meeting is one of the premier membrane conferences in the world, providing outstanding technical sessions across the full breadth of topics within membrane science and technology. The theme of the 2023 meeting is \"A New Era of Sustainable Membrane Innovation, \" focusing on the latest developments and innovations in membrane science geared towards improving sustainability. This year, two new sessions \u2013 \u201cPolymer Design for Membranes\u201d and \u201cHighly Selective Separations\u201d \u2013 have been added to the program. The meeting has a rich history of engaging undergraduate and graduate student researchers through targeted technical programs, student networking-mentoring programs, and recognizing their accomplishments. The goal of this travel support is to extend these opportunities to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate student researchers who might otherwise be unable to attend the conference. Additionally, it will provide a platform for students to network with community leaders and fellow students. Early engagement in a professional society\u2019s activities will motivate and encourage students to pursue advanced degrees in their respective fields and develop a healthy and diverse workforce.\r\n\r\nThe 2023 NAMS meeting will cover various topics related to membrane materials, processes, and applications. The meeting will feature 23 technical sessions, daily plenary sessions, a poster session, and abundant unstructured discussion periods to catalyze new collaborative relationships and research ideas. The organizing committee is comprised of North American-based researchers, and invited speakers from academia, industry, and government labs feature prominently in the program. Historically, hundreds of graduate students participate in the NAMS meeting and engage in unique professional development and training opportunities. This award will extend such opportunities to a cohort of U.S.-based undergraduate and graduate students with the intention of growing and retaining a diverse community of membrane scientists and engineers. All undergraduate attendees will be paired with senior graduate student mentors who will serve as meeting guides and support an immersive experience. The program's effectiveness will be assessed through surveys and observation of student outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
