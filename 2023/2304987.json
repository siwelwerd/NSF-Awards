 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Xinfeng Gao and Dr. Jonathan Karty at Indiana University are acquiring helium recovery and liquefaction equipment to recycle the helium used by eight spectrometers in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) facility at Indiana University \u2013 Bloomington (IUB). NMR is an essential method used by researchers to investigate the structure and motion of a wide range of molecules. Liquid helium is used to maintain superconductivity of magnets essential to NMR spectrometers. As helium slowly evaporates, periodic refills with liquid helium are needed. About 4,200 liters of liquid helium are annually used by the IUB NMR facility. Helium is a precious non-renewable natural resource critical to the aerospace, medical, and scientific research communities.  Current supplies are not sufficient to meet all needs. IUB will build a system to capture helium gas as it evaporates from NMR magnets and then liquefy that helium for reuse. This helium recovery system will reduce the IUB NMR facility\u2019s liquid helium purchases substantially, generating significant helium and cost savings. \r\n\r\nThe IUB NMR facility provides access to state-of-the-art instrumentation and expertise in solution NMR spectroscopy to more than 160 researchers, supporting research into organic, organometallic, materials, carbohydrate, supramolecular, protein, peptide, and medicinal chemistry while also providing high resolution NMR instrumentation for upper-division laboratory courses for undergraduates. Training the next generation of chemists and biochemists is a core mission of the IUB Chemistry Department. Undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral trainees need access to high resolution NMR spectrometers to learn modern techniques and complete their research.  This helium recovery and liquefaction system will  insulate IU Bloomington researchers from future helium supply shortages and ensures that the NMR facility will remain a viable research resource and a critical asset to the university's teaching mission. Sustainable and affordable research infrastructure significantly will enhance IUB Chemistry\u2019s ability to recruit a diverse cohort of faculty and students for both the research and teaching missions of the department.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
