 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of technologies to help deepen transportation electrification and widely implement renewable clean energies for decarbonizing our society to achieve sustainable prosperity. The success of this project will further accelerate technology transfer, increase economic competitiveness, and help the United States remain a leading position in new energies. There is an urgent desire worldwide on transportation electrification. The key lies in a robust high energy rechargeable battery to power electric vehicles, which is expected to satisfy the following requirements: a high energy density for a driving range of \u2265300 miles, an affordable cost, reliable safety free of fires and explosions, and a long lifetime. The proposed technology has the potential to meet all these requirements and surpasses the current lithium-ion battery technologies.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of high-energy anode-free lithium-metal batteries, which consists of an anode current collector and a lithiated cathode. The high performance of this battery is based on the innovative atomic and molecular layer deposition technology of the team for novel functional nanocoatings. These nanocoatings are applied onto the anode current collector and the lithiated cathode and result in remarkably improved performance. Lithium-ion batteries have changed our lifestyles in many aspects but are approaching their energy limit. They also suffer from some other issues related to cost, lifetime, and safety. Consequently, all these drawbacks of lithium-ion batteries have stimulated new battery concepts while anode-free lithium-metal batteries are among the most compelling ones. Anode-free lithium-metal batteries have the potential to maximize battery energy density, minimize battery cost, and remarkably improve battery safety.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
