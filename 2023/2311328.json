 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the operation of the Seafloor Sample Laboratory at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. This repository has more than 26,000 samples from the world\u2019s oceans. Samples from the collection are distributed to researchers and educators across the globe. Research using collection samples have addressed important problems related to climate change, ocean circulation, ocean resources, and geohazards. Repository personnel engage in numerous outreach and education activities. Undergraduate interns, including those from underrepresented groups in the geosciences, assist in repository activities.\r\n\r\nPreviously acquired samples curated at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Seafloor Samples Laboratory provide opportunities for a wide variety of research projects including preliminary studies, investigations where archived material plays a supplemental role to ongoing research, and stand-alone ventures that depend wholly on those materials already collected. Sample requests are fulfilled for scholars, educators, and students from around the world at no cost to the end user. Continuing support from the National Science Foundation enables the Seafloor Samples Laboratory to provide consistent and quality facilities and services to an international community of Earth and environmental scientists. The purpose of the repository facilitates marine science and education by providing access to valuable samples from the seafloor collected over many decades. To do this lab personnel work to 1) expand and curate the collections, 2) distribute geological subsamples to clients, 3) promote access to the diverse collections via outreach programs and web and data services, 4) serve as a community resource for field sampling techniques, and 5) collaborate with and train scientists and students in best practices. Data obtained from samples in the collection are an enduring resource for the community to ask new and innovative questions and for the development and application of new techniques. These activities lead to novel scientific insights. Samples provided to researchers are being used to examine a vast array of topics including tectonics, rheology, minerology, climate change, geohazards, and environmental pollution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
