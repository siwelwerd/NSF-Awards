 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John\u2019s University (CSBSJU) to purchase a circular dichroism (CD) spectrometer to probe the structure and stability of biomolecules. There are several broader impacts of this project. The first is the scientific training of CSBSJU undergraduates and the enhancement of cutting-edge biomolecular characterization in the undergraduate teaching laboratories, which will reach 226 undergraduates per year. CD spectroscopy is an excellent addition to the interdisciplinary foundational laboratory curriculum at CSBSJU that is instrument focused. In addition, CD spectroscopy provides depth to upper-division research-based laboratory experiences. This project will allow all chemistry and biochemistry majors to gain hands on experience with CD spectroscopy which will aid in their preparation for strong performance in graduate school and the scientific work force. The CD spectrometer will not only strengthen the research infrastructure of CSBSJU, but it will also be made available to those who are part of the Midwest regional hub of the MDH CUREs Community (Malate Dehydrogenase Course Undergraduate Research Experience, NSF #2119918), which the PI of this grant leads. This will offer expanded opportunities for students from under resourced institutions as that is the focus of the MDH CUREs Community. It is expected that these latter partnerships will lead to enhanced collaborative curricular and undergraduate research opportunities. In addition, as CSBSJU is an AEOP (Army Educational Outreach Program) Apprenticeship site, high school students from local schools and identifying with backgrounds historically underserved and underrepresented in STEM will also have the opportunity to work with the CD spectrometer, as the co-PI of this project directs the AEOP at CSBSJU and both the PI and co-PI of this project have been, and will continue to be, research mentors in the AEOP.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of this project focus on advancing research in the structure and stability of biomolecules from four undergraduate research groups. These projects include understanding interactions of peptides and model proteins on patterned surfaces formed through self-assembly; the structure and regulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors by endogenous neurosteriods; protein engineering of malate dehydrogenase to incorporate a fluorescence reporter of conformational changes to use in metabolon studies; determining interactions of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with plasma proteins; understanding the effects of oxidative modifications of proteins on protein-nanoparticle interactions; and the structure of mutant low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatases and their interactions with inhibitors. In each of these projects, undergraduates will be using the CD spectrometer to generate new knowledge related to the structure, stability, and function of particular proteins.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
