The Symposium of Additive Manufacturing Modeling, Simulation, and Machine Learning is one of the key symposia at the MS&T23 conference, sponsored by the Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (TMS) Additive Manufacturing Committee, the Integrated Computational Materials Engineering Committee, and the Computational Materials Science and Engineering Committee. Additive manufacturing continues to have significant societal impact through design and manufacturing innovation, personalized healthcare products, and enhancement of supply chains. Data-driven approaches such as machine learning, offer tremendous opportunities to tackle challenges associated with understanding and practicing additive manufacturing. Despite extensive efforts, challenges still exist in physics-based model formulation, experimental validation, and machine learning applications. The AMMSML symposium will serve as a unique platform to share the latest research and development related to these topics.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this award, through providing participant support, is for the selected students and post-doctoral scholars to make technical presentations at the AMMSML symposium and interact with leading experts in the field. The awardees will have the opportunity to showcase their research, improve communication and presentation skills, increase their networking exposure, learn about emerging research, and be inspired to prepare for a career in additive manufacturing and/or machine learning. The grant opportunity will be announced through professional organizations and relevant media to reach out to a broad audience and maximize its impact. The project will make a special effort to reach out to students and post-doctoral scholars from underrepresented groups when broadcasting this opportunity, targeting their involvement and ultimately retention in careers related to advanced manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
