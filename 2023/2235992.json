 "awd_abstract_narration": "The world population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050. A critical challenge facing humanity is growing demand for nutrient-dense foods with longer shelf-life and environmental resilience to reach regions of the world most impacted by extreme weather conditions, geopolitical turmoil, and mass migration. Milk is nutrient-dense, containing vitamins and minerals, fat, and protein content used to produce a range of products that are widely consumed across the world by people of all ages, from infants to seniors. However, current dairy product manufacturing methods are rate limited, and use outdated processing practices that suffer from critical efficiency shortcomings in monitoring protein integrity, separation science, and spray drying of protein powders. This project will address the knowledge gap currently preventing adoption of state-of-the-art technological solutions by creating a roadmap for the implementation of intelligent sensing and advanced manufacturing technologies aimed at efficient production of high-value products for consumers that address nutrition security at a domestic and global level.\r\n\r\nThe project team's use-inspired approach targets farmers and rural communities, dairy processors, and consumers of food products containing dairy protein powder ingredients. Dairy is the single largest component of the Idaho agricultural economy, being driven predominantly by farmers and processors in rural counties, where underserved minority populations are increasing at a rapid rate in a state that is among the fastest growing in the United States. This project will focus on educational programs and workforce development for these underserved minority populations through land grant university extension outreach programs, partnership with dairy marketing and communication organizations (Dairy West), and organizations dedicated to the training and workforce development pipeline for students to careers in dairy processing (BUILD Dairy). University programs including the Vertically Integrated Project curriculum and BUILD Dairy-sponsored projects, offer students training essential for their employment in high-paying, benefit-eligible positions in rural communities throughout Idaho and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this Convergence Accelerator is to modernize the dairy processing industry by fusing artificial intelligence, chemometric sensing, and advanced manufacturing tools to achieve transformative efficiency, quality, and quantity gains in the production of shelf-stable, nutrient-dense, protein powder products. To achieve this convergence goal, a team of academic researchers and industry stakeholders with exceptional credentials, experience, and knowledge in food and dairy chemistry, computer science/artificial intelligence, microbiology, rheology, food process engineering, and food process technology has been assembled.\r\n\r\nThe specific deliverables are: (1) Develop artificial intelligence-based chemometric solutions to automate the use of near-infrared spectroscopy for the real-time analysis of proteins in milk during processing to improve the quality of dairy products and reduce waste; (2) Implement and optimize operating conditions for advanced manufacturing pulsed electric field and extruder equipment into dairy facilities to improve processing efficiency, product quality, reduce waste, conserve energy, and expand capacity; and (3) Converge sciences, engineering, computer science, food science, nutrition, dairy farming, supply chain management, and workforce training to develop innovative protein products for early childhood development, adolescent and adult nutrition, and senior care that are shelf-stable, nutrient-dense, and impactful to a global market.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
