 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is to provide technology to combat the development of antimicrobial resistance in fungi. There are only three main classes of antifungal drugs used to treat the most common fungal infections. Species such as Cryptococcus neoformans have resistance to a large portion of one or more classes of antifungals. This means that much higher doses of these drugs are needed than usual. Clinical management of these cases can be difficult, causing extreme health difficulties as well as economic hardships for vulnerable populations like people who are elderly or who are immunocompromised with HIV/AIDS. The issues are further exacerbated by poor antimicrobial stewardship in agriculture where overuse of these same antifungals is leading to a rise in drug resistance even outside of the clinic. Technology is needed to improve the activity of existing antimicrobial drugs and make them safe and effective for use against even the most challenging drug-resistant strains. This project seeks to identify the market potential for technology that can lower the doses of drugs needed to treat resistant fungi. This technology has the potential to impact a multi-billion-dollar industry and keep the existing classes of antifungals useful for many years to come. \r\n\r\nThe project is based on the development of antimicrobial peptides from the outer loop region of the C. neoformans P4-ATPase enzyme. The enzyme controls the movement of lipids from the outer surface of the cell to the inside of the cell. The fungus C. neoformans is resistant to the drug Caspofungin. It was found that removing cdc50 makes treatment with caspofungin easier. Preventing the movement of lipids leaves the fungal cells vulnerable to attack from caspofungin and some of the main classes of antifungal drugs. The antimicrobial peptides block the movement of the lipids, and they can therefore be used in a combination treatment with other antifungal drugs. To this end, a patent has been filed to support the development of the technology. Several papers have been published and/or are in preparation related to this technology. Work will continue to be done to improve the peptide activity and make the most effective treatment possible.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project supported the Team AFI: Antifungal Inhibitors, in their discovery of the customers who might use an drug that can treat fungal infections. The team interviewed people who have had fungal infections as well as people working in the insurance industry and also people who are infectious disease doctors. The process continued throughout the lifetime of the grant. The team found that the latter group, Infectious disease doctors, were most likely to be the ones prescribing such a technology. Infectious disease doctors described how individuals with fungal infections can sometimes need to return to the hospital multiple times for the same infection. Despite this, the doctors may run into an issue with the fact that insurance companies may only cover the patients for a certain amount of antifungal drugs. Thus, if the patients run out of coverage, it becomes difficult for the doctors to treat such individuals.\n\n\nBased on feedback from the infectious disease doctors, in the second half of the project the team developed a prototype molecule that the team believes can be taken orally instead of injected into the body. The doctors informed the team that this type of antifungal could be more useful to treat patients in their clinics. The team is now pursuing the development of prototype molecules, which may be involved in new customer discovery efforts. This may involve talking to infectious disease doctors and comparing the efficiency of both the original and the new type of antifungal drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the team was able to develop enough insights to decide to further pursue the development of this technology. The team will work with their respective universities on promoting and possibly marketing this technology. A future goal will be to secure more funding for the development of a possibly company surrounding this technology.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/03/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: GregoryRWiedman\n"
