 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2023, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment, and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Social behaviors interact with multiple facets of an animal\u2019s life, including space use, survival, and reproduction. In a world of accelerating change, it is critical to understand how social behaviors can help animals adapt to changing environments and when social behaviors restrict animals from adapting to new conditions. This project uses theoretical models and long-term observations from wild Asian elephant populations to ask 1) how genetic and environmental factors influence the structure of animal social systems and 2) how social systems change in response to habitat degradation and population turnover. The outcomes of this research inform conservation policy to protect endangered Asian elephant populations and mitigate human-elephant conflict across South and Southeast Asia. Additionally, teaching materials and outreach activities developed by the fellow for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students directly contribute to education and recruitment in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe fellow investigates factors altering social behavior using mathematical models and existing behavioral observations from three geographically and genetically isolated island populations of Asian elephant, encompassing the three sister species: Sri Lankan, Sumatran, and Bornean Asian elephants. The project develops theoretical models to assess the role of genetic and environmental factors on social phenotypes using multiagent simulations and social network analysis. Models are used to predict social dynamics and population persistence under different land use scenarios and variable turnover rates to provide informative projections for land use management. Training activities include gaining skills in 1) quantitative research methods from the research itself, 2) conservation policy and community engagement through collaborations with the UC San Diego School of Global Policy & Strategy and the non-profit organization Trunk & Leaves, and 3) teaching and mentorship through developing materials for a UC San Diego undergraduate field methods course, a graduate/young professionals workshop at the Society for Conservation Biology annual meeting, and outreach events for K-12 students in collaboration with the UC San Diego education programs, CREATE and Library NExT.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
