 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by encouraging talented mathematics majors to become secondary school teachers. In particular, it seeks to recruit, prepare and increase the number highly effective secondary school mathematics teachers in high-need local school districts. Cal State University Fullerton (CSUF) is a Hispanic-serving institution which will seek to recruit prospective math teachers who reflect the institution's diversity and can act as role models and mentors while providing rich mathematics instruction to all secondary students in the CSUF service area. Freshmen and Sophomore math majors at CSUF will be recruited as potential scholarship candidates (associates). Potential scholarship awardees (Juniors and Seniors) will come from a pool of current associates and other students from CSUF and local community colleges. Students will receive targeted academic advisement and mentorship, as well as internships in active learning classrooms, and also attend seminars focused on equitable mathematics teaching. The project will provide scholars with induction support in their first two years as practicing teachers, including mentorship and participation in the Math Teachers' Circle (MTC) at CSUF. MTCs are professional communities of K-12 mathematics teachers and mathematicians that meet regularly to work on rich mathematics problems, allowing teachers to enrich their knowledge and experience of math, while building meaningful partnerships with other teachers and mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThis project is a collaboration between CSUF and the Anaheim Union High School District (AUHSD). Activities include, but are not limited to, classroom observations, professional development, and student teaching at one of the AUHSD schools. This collaboration seeks to create a continuum of teaching experiences for future secondary school mathematics teachers, from the first year of college through the post-baccalaureate credential year. In each of the project\u2019s five years, the CSUF College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics and the College of Education will identify and recruit 4 associates and 9 scholars. At the same time, project leaders will create an effective, sustainable model for preparing prospective secondary school mathematics teachers who transfer from a community college to a four-year institution, thus adding new knowledge on how to streamline this process. The project will examine the effectiveness of mentoring on persistence rates and success in achieving a degree and teaching credential. Results will be disseminated via the project's website as well as through professional organizations such as the Mathematical Association of America (MAA), the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), and the Math Teacher Education Partnership (MTE-Partnership). This Noyce Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
