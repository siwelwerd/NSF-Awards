 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will be implemented as a series of conferences to bring together research-performing institutions in Middle Tennessee (TN) to collaboratively address the best ways to enhance the research enterprise of the region, which is home to emerging research institutions, including historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), rural-serving institutions, public and private entities, and faith-based institutions. National investment in research in this region cannot reach its full potential without strategically planned growth of the workforce and resources that support the research ecosystem. Although emerging research institutions in Middle TN have demonstrated research excellence, there remain further opportunities to enhance their ability to submit proposals for research funding, proactively collaborate with neighboring institutions for large multi-institutional opportunities, or develop important partnerships with corporate and government organizations. The sheer diversity of the research-performing institutions in the area underscores a need for intensive communication, intentional inclusion, and careful deliberations that will result in the creation of enduring partnerships. To meet this need, the project team will create the Middle TN Research Administration and Innovation Network (M-TRAIN), a network whose diverse composition promises to be a national model for research enterprise collaboration. The planned convenings will catalyze growth in the regional research enterprise by connecting disparate research performers while addressing the unique needs and strengths of the individual institutions. As federal research opportunities requiring institutional, and often regional, collaborations are becoming more common, such a model is critical to ensure national competitiveness in science and engineering research participation.\r\n\r\nThe Core Partners of M-TRAIN reflect the institutional diversity of Middle TN, including Vanderbilt University (research-intensive private Institution), Tennessee State University (public HBCU), and Fisk University (private HBCU). Middle TN is home to 35 colleges and universities, with a mix of public and private organizations, including five rural-serving institutions and four HBCUs. This institutional diversity will inform M-TRAIN conference discussions to identify the strengths and needs of the research development infrastructure at regional institutions, further building trust and relationships, and determining best practices for synergistic and collaborative approaches as participants pursue opportunities for scientific and economic innovation. Workshop topics will include broadly: research development, research administration, research compliance, and research translation. Objectives are to build and expand research administration infrastructure across the region and enhance inter-institutional cohesiveness and collective readiness to respond to the increasing number of funding opportunities seeking a regional response.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
