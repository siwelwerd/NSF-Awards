 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project furthers understanding of how first-generation (FG) and continuing-generation (CG) students meet and overcome the academic barriers they face. The research hypothesis is that engagement, success, retention, and well-being will be higher for those students who (a) strongly identify themselves with their academic role, and (b) have at least one person in their network who cares about his or her academic success. The project also examines whether any of these factors are different for FG than for CG students. This research moves the discussion of the FG experience toward a more thoughtful consideration of the contributions of students\u2019 most important social relationships. In doing so we develop a coherent theoretical frame that will help to organize the existing knowledge base and give direction to original and actionable research on FG students. We also conduct a rigorous yearlong training seminar for advanced undergraduate students that includes conference presentations, guest speakers, and site visits to research laboratories at Hunter College and Rutgers\u2014Newark. As well, this project supports the development of underutilized space to expand Felician\u2019s Psychology Research Laboratory and Training Center. It furthermore funds the establishment of a Felician University white paper series. Findings from this project ultimately inform a training model and an evidence-based intervention for undergraduate students. Students who identify with what they learn and are supported by trusted network members concerned with their academic well-being\u2014academic confidantes\u2014will lead generative lives and contribute to the nation\u2019s human capital.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
