 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Lake Superior State University to support the acquisition of a micro X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (\u03bcXRF) with remote operation capabilities. The \u03bcXRF enables high-resolution imaging and elemental analysis, supports a consortium of 14 researchers at eight institutions and their collaborators, facilitates external use for research, education, engineering/industrial applications, and promotes a regional research community. These capabilities enrich undergraduate education and training across several scientific disciplines, create new opportunities for undergraduate research, and enable the development of new coursework in microanalysis and plant nutrient metabolism. A K-12 outreach program offered in collaboration with the Eastern Upper Peninsula Intermediate School District provides hands-on education opportunities and enhances recruitment of underrepresented students promoting the development of a diverse regional STEM workforce. Work supported by this award will provide practical benefits including improvement in phytoremediation strategies, improved fisheries management practices, and analysis of French colonial artifacts that will be incorporated into public displays at Fort Michilimackinac, part of Mackinac State Historic Parks. \r\n\r\nResearch facilitated by this award will advance our understanding of plant nutrient metabolism, phytoremediation of soils, freshwater ecology, forensic science, organismal biology, geology, and characterization of historical artifacts. The key capabilities of this instrument include elemental quantification and mapping at tens of micrometers resolution under atmospheric pressure, detection limits for heavy elements in the tens of ppm, light element analysis, suitability for analysis of intact and/or living organisms, and high throughput sample analysis. The superior resolution and detection limits compared to XRF and other \u03bcXRF instruments will enable element quantification and distribution in a diverse range of organisms. Imaging and quantification of element distributions will enable the investigation of element mobility and storage, enhancing research in plant mineral metabolism and localization of metals in aquatic organisms. This instrument will also allow for the analysis of the rare earth elements in local rock structures for use in rechargeable batteries and of archeological artifacts at Mackinac State Historic Parks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
