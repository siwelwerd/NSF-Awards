 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award enables about 20 US students to attend the 2023 Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM, pronounced \"wisdom\"), which will be held in Singapore (https://www.wsdm-conference.org/2023/) from February 27 to March 3, 2022. The aim is to support a diverse group of students and make it possible for them to attend the conference and discuss and disseminate their work. The conference also provides an opportunity for them to interact with international researchers. \r\n\r\nThe WSDM conference, which was established in 2008, brings together researchers and industry practitioners into a comprehensive program for publication, education, and interaction, including research papers, tutorials, doctoral symposium, and a machine learning competition-style event (WSDM cup). The program includes publications related to web search and data mining defined broadly, and particularly encourages publications on practical yet principled novel models of search and data mining, algorithm design and analysis, economic implications, and in-depth experimental analysis of accuracy and performance. The program also includes keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry and workshops that demand dedicated coverage due to their relevance to the current research and development in web search and data mining. All these activities provide a unique opportunity for students to share their knowledge, experience, and research projects with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
