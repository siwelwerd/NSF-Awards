 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase post-secondary student success via academic and career guidance. A large body of research on career navigation has studied how post-secondary education, career readiness (understanding viable career paths at graduation), and its interconnectedness are important for a growing number of first-generation, low-income, and underrepresented students. With increasing undergraduate degree program offerings in response to an evolving future of work and student-to-counselor ratios of 1: 1,800 in public colleges, career guidance, and academic navigation risk being unavailable. As a result, during the pandemic, Institutes of Higher Education (IHEs) that serve students of color and students from low-income backgrounds saw declines in enrollment that far outpaced their predominantly White peer institutions. The proposed platform intends to increase the visibility, accessibility, and discoverability of competencies to potential career and academic paths for students at IHEs. The platform envisions doing this via near-peer role models who are similar in their dimensions of self-efficacy. With more than 85 million jobs that could go unfilled by 2030, the proposed platform may help alleviate part of that shortage by widening the talent aperture.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is in the company\u2019s patented technology of a unified, multi-dimensional, data representation model that creates a \u2018competency fingerprint\u2019 for each user. The data representation method enables better machine learning models to \u2018infer\u2019 competency from unstructured data of a student\u2019s traditional and non-traditional learning experience, rather than degrees, majors, grade point averages (GPAs), or test scores. The platform uses a consistent, scalable, competency nomenclature for hard and soft skills gained via traditional academic and outside-of-the-classroom experiences to discover academic-career paths where the students\u2019 learning competencies may be in demand. There is a significant technical challenge in adopting this technology for the inter/cross-disciplinary jobs of the future:  such a platform requires a robust, larger data set to evaluate the relevance of matching, in a discipline-agnostic context. Reduction of this variability is the key technical risk to be overcome by the proposed research and development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
