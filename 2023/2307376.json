 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oregon State University (OSU) will implement the ADVANCE Journal, a peer-reviewed, online, open access scientific research journal focused on institutional transformation, intersectionality, inclusion, equity, and justice. A major component of the work will be to develop a sustainability plan for the journal.  The ADVANCE Journal was begun in 2018. Since then, the journal has become an important venue for sharing NSF ADVANCE grantee generated research and lessons learned with both ADVANCE communities and the broader higher education community.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the journal is to share knowledge that has the potential to improve climate, processes, relationships, and experiences of STEM faculty regardless of gender. The journal provides a forum for research, narratives, case studies, art, and other genres of scholarship that increase knowledge and promote action toward institutional transformation with inclusion, equity, and justice at the center. The journal provides a unique publishing space for sharing lessons learned by multidisciplinary authors that may not find acceptance in more traditional journals. The journal team will work with the ADVANCE Resource Coordination (ARC) Network and other organizations to create a business plan to sustain the journal in the future.\r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.\u202f Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.\u202f\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
