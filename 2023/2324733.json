 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sharing of all science artifacts (source data, code, and workflow) is fundamental to reproducible and replicable research. The geoscience community is only now beginning to harness the power of the open source model, and formal training on the benefits and proper use of this model is still missing from most geoscience curricula. This project proposes a series of workshops aimed at teaching geoscientists at different career levels how to integrate relevant open source tools into their work, and make these tools an integral part of their publishing process. Additionally, participants will learn how to contribute to the production and maintenance of open-source research software. By doing so, this project will facilitate collaboration among scientists with diverse perspectives, educational backgrounds, skill levels, and computer proficiency, promoting a level playing field for all participants.\r\n\r\nThis project will leverage existing community endeavors to create concise training sessions focused on the effective use of open source resources and best practices in science publishing within the open source community. This project will expand on the human infrastructure supporting open sciences resources while promoting best practices for the reproducibility of geoscience research. Acquiring the skills to participate in the open science community will offer opportunities beyond the realm of pure academic research, which will build capacity in the American data science workforce and help bridge the gap between academic research and market-ready solutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
