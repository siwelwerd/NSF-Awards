 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Multidisciplinary Instrumentation in Support of Oceanography (MISO) Facility at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) has provided routine access to deep-sea imaging, lighting, power and sensor instrumentation for over two decades. This capability to support US and international academic oceanography across many disciplines has included equipment used successfully on over 75 research cruises since 2002. A key component of MISO Facility support has been the design, development and implementation of robust deep-sea imaging capabilities that have been used on a wide array of deep-submergence vehicles (Alvin, PISCES, ROV Jason, AUV Sentry, ROV Hercules, ROV DR-2, ROV Sebastian, ROV Aegir6000), towed deep-sea imaging systems (i.e., the MISO TowCam system, seafloor time lapse systems developed by the MISO Facility, and seafloor sampling systems such as box corers and multicorers. The OI Program recommends funding to purchase the following components required to assemble autonomous, self-recording, high-resolution deep-sea camera systems:\r\n\r\n1)\tSix (6) Deep-Sea Power & Light DigiSeacam housings\t$73,800\r\n2)\tTwo (2) Hero11 multi-camera module systems\t\t$11,028\r\n3)\tDSPL LED SeaLite 2050 deep-sea lights\t$11,645\r\n4)\tSubsea Cabling\t$7,000\r\n\tMaterials and Supplies\t\t\t$9,070\r\n\tIDC\t\t\t$5,931\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$118,474\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nBroader Impacts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The optical configuration of these camera systems consists of two lens elements and a high pressure-corrected dome port, designed as a optical assembly to correct for image distortion typical of domed optical elements. The dome optics have been integrated into three configurations of deep-sea housing and internal chassis designs that permit GoPro HERO4&trade; and HERO11&trade; camera modules fitted with a 5.4 mm non-distortion lens to be axially aligned with the dome. Camera modules use 1 TB microSD memory cards and are connected to high-capacity USB-C batteries or custom Li-battery packs to provide self-contained power for the camera operations. The supplemental power and recording media storage permit operations that can last &gt;24 hours for 27MP still imaging at a high repetition rate (~5 sec intervals), or ~18 hours for 4k or 5.3k cinematic video acquisition at 30 fps. The depth of field of these fixed-focus cameras extends from ~0.5 m to infinity within the subsea environment and with very little distortion, including minimal vignetting, across the field of view. The self-contained power and autonomous design of these cameras permit a wide range of installation options for a variety of deep-sea vehicles, towed systems, and seafloor sampling devices to document seabed and mid-water features and processes.</p>\r\n<p>Imagery collected using these cameras has benefited a wide range of oceanographic studies by US and international researchers in study areas as diverse as: eastern equatorial Pacific Seamounts, southwest Pacific active submarine volcanoes (Havre), mid-ocean ridges and hydrothermal vent fields (including: Arctic ridges, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, northern East Pacific Rise, Juan de Fuca Ridge, Guaymas Basin), submarine seep environments on continental shelves off Norway, Greenland, Gulf of Mexico, US east coast submarine canyons, California and Oregon borderlands, mesophotic reefs, and around the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands. In addition to their use for high-resolution documentation of key seafloor phenomena and life, they have been used in numerous outreach efforts to bring the wonders of the deep-ocean and seafloor to the public to underscore the importance of the need to continue to explore and study 'inner space' - the global ocean and seafloor.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/11/2025<br>\nModified by: Daniel&nbsp;J&nbsp;Fornari</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2313521/2313521_10856188_1744394991665_gopro2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2313521/2313521_10856188_1744394991665_gopro2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"3rd generation MISO GoPro camera\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2313521/2313521_10856188_1744394991665_gopro2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"3rd generation MISO GoPro camera\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">3rd-generation MISO GoPro? camera system in a new (2024-manufacture) DeepSea Digi SeaCam housing (6000 m rated).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel Fornari</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;J&nbsp;Fornari\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">3rd generation MISO GoPro camera</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2313521/2313521_10856188_1744395248750_gopro3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2313521/2313521_10856188_1744395248750_gopro3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Deep-sea hydrothermal vent imaged with a new MISO GoPro camera - EPR 9 50'N\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2313521/2313521_10856188_1744395248750_gopro3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Deep-sea hydrothermal vent imaged with a new MISO GoPro camera - EPR 9 50'N\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">27MP image of newly discovered hydrothermal vent at 2534 m depth on the axis of the East Pacific Rise near 10\ufffdN acquired with the 3rd generation MISO Digi SeaCam system using a GoPro HERO11\ufffd camera on Alvin's 'brow' (above pilot's viewport), notations in the image are metadata from Alvin's data syst</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel Fornari</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;J&nbsp;Fornari\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Deep-sea hydrothermal vent imaged with a new MISO GoPro camera - EPR 9 50'N</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
