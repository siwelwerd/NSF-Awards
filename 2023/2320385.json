 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a direct write laser system at Norfolk State University. This instrumentation uses a versatile nanofabrication technique to directly pattern a material at very small scales with high precision and accuracy. This will provide state-of-the-art technology to enhance scientific research and education in the areas of materials science and semiconductor technologies. The direct write laser system will enable research that addresses fundamental issues in fields such as micro-optics, data storage, microelectronics, and photonics. It not only advances these fields but also supports education and diversity by equipping students with valuable hands-on experience. By enabling students and researchers to access this advanced instrument, the project promotes the progress of science and enhances workforce development. Furthermore, the project benefits society by fostering interdisciplinary research, innovation, and contributing to the overall welfare and prosperity of the nation particularly with respect to semiconductor research and workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis project will allow for the precise and accurate patterning of materials on a micro or nano scale, benefiting diverse research efforts at Norfolk State University. The instrument will include a powerful laser with optimized parameters, such as wavelength and pulse duration. Advanced software will provide precise laser control, allowing fabrication of intricate patterns and designs. The integration of complementary tools such as electron beam lithography into the direct write laser system will increase its versatility and expand its potential applications. This system will drive advancements in materials science, semiconductor technologies, and wearable biosensors by providing exceptional precision, resolution, and compatibility with various materials. It will allow scientists to investigate novel phenomena, create innovative devices, and push the limits of scientific knowledge in nanofabrication and related fields. It is anticipated that the instrument acquisition will contribute to scientific advancement, foster interdisciplinary collaborations, and establish Norfolk State University as a leading center for nanofabrication research.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Instrumentation Research Program (MRI) and the Advanced Manufacturing Program (AM) in the division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
