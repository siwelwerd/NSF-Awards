In conjunction with the conference there will be a meeting devoted to research presentations by undergraduate students celebrating the Ohio Delta Chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon National Honorary Mathematics Society. The main goals of the conference are to inspire the new generation of mathematicians by exposing students to cutting-edge research in the area of Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems, foster collaborations between participants between researchers in the Tri-State region (Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana), and encourage involvement of underrepresented minorities in mathematical research on this topic. The 2023 Mathematics Conference will have an additional goal of reviving in-person interactions and rebuilding the community negatively impacted by the recent pandemic. \r\n\r\nA broad range of topics will be presented in invited talks by Janet Best (The Ohio State University), Todd Kapitula (Calvin University), and Milena Stanislavova (The University of Alabama at Birmingham). Participants will present their research results in a series of parallel talks. Sessions devoted to student presentations are planned. Students will be addressed by Stephanie Edwards (Hope College), the President of Pi Mu Epsilon National Honorary Mathematics Society. The conference will serve as a platform for social interactions between students and junior researchers with senior mathematicians through a sequence of organized events. Conference information is available on the following website: https://miamioh.edu/cas/academics/departments/mathematics/about/events/annual-mathematics-conference/index.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
