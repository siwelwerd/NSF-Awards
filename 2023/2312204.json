 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficient data-driven policy learning and deployment techniques are transforming many facets of our society as a result of their broad applicability in engineering, scientific and societal applications. Given the access to high-performance computing, the use of simulators and digital twins, for example, have emerged as practical alternatives to test and learn complex optimization policies. As a result, significant scholarly efforts have been devoted to this research area in the past decade. However, despite having made landmark progress, existing work in this area often makes a key (implicit) assumption; namely, that the environment in which the policy is trained will be the same as the environment in which the policy is deployed. Policies learned under this assumption can be fragile, as this assumption often does not hold in practical environments, either due to the simulator model specification or environment shifts. The goal of this project is to study statistical and algorithmic foundations for developing provably efficient robust policy learning in unknown environments, under a possibly misspecified generative model.   \r\n\r\nThe project studies comprehensive statistical and algorithmic foundations for distributionally robust policy learning in contextual bandits and reinforcement learning (RL) environments and develops statistically optimal and computationally efficient algorithms across a wide range of non-parametric distributional shifts. These provide a powerful framework for capturing model-agnostic environment changes, but at the same time, pose intellectual challenges as the unknown worst-case environment lies in an infinite-dimensional space. The presented program opens up several fundamental research directions that call for novel and principled developments. First, the project develops information-theoretic tools to understand the fundamental learning limits for distributionally robust policy learning and to characterize how the distributional uncertainty contributes to the difficulty of learning. Additionally, the project develops computationally efficient and statistically optimal estimation schemes for distributionally robust performance analysis of a given policy. Lastly, the project translates the efficiency gains in estimation due to learning a distributionally robust policy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
