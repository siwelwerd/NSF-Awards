 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award will provide partial support for US-based participants to attend the conference, The Many Interactions of Symplectic and Poisson Geometry, to take place June 19-23, 2023, at the Institut Henri Poincar\\\u2019e in Paris, France.  Symplectic and Poisson geometry are sibling branches of geometry, both rooted deeply in mathematical formulation of mechanics and mathematical physics. This international conference will bring together leading experts of the two areas, as well as nearby domains, to present the recent significant advances in each area, to discuss the open problems and challenges in each field, and to create a forum for mathematicians at all career stages to interact, collaborate, and propose directions for future research. The award will provide US-based early-career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not otherwise funded by NSF the opportunity to participate in the conference.  \r\n \r\nThis conference aims to help researchers in the related areas identify and jumpstart promising new research directions, and to immerse graduate students and junior researchers in the most current research in the fields. Topics will cover a wide range of areas in symplectic and Poisson geometry, including contact geometry, Dirac and generalized complex geometry, geometric mechanics, higher structures, integrable systems, Lie groupoids and algebroids, microlocal analysis, mirror symmetry, quantization and noncommutative geometry, quantum groups and representation theory, and symplectic topology.\r\n \r\nAdditional details are available at https://sites.google.com/view/weinstein80/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
