 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a three-year research collaboration involving the Algebra Project, the Center for Innovation in STEM Education Research at Kennesaw State University, and the National Society of Black Engineers. The project aims to demonstrate that the way in which mathematics curriculum is designed, taught, and practiced impacts access to and success in Calculus. The project will work with two teams of math teachers and their students to introduce and develop the concepts of Calculus in the context of high school Algebra II. This approach has the potential to raise the level of quantitative literacy for all students and increase the pool of Calculus-ready and hence STEM-ready students.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive, standards-aligned Algebra II curriculum based upon the Algebra Project\u2019s Polynomial Calculus and Five-Step Curricular Process. This geometric introduction to differential and integral calculus does not require the mechanisms of analysis. And the culturally responsive Five-Step process emphasizes student voice, drawing on natural language to develop meaningful, connected understandings of abstract mathematical ideas. A second goal is to enhance the knowledge and skills of participating teachers and students through this collaborative curricular development. Both teachers and students will gain a deeper understanding of mathematics, while teachers also learn culturally responsive pedagogies and curriculum design. Finally, the project aims to encourage participants to recognize their voice and expertise, gain agency and a positive identity in mathematics or mathematics education. Drawing upon the tenets of Participatory Action Research, the youth, teacher, and expert researcher team will develop case studies to examine the emergence of voice, agency, and identity among participants in the project. In addition, the expert research team will determine the extent to which students and teachers have mastered the fundamental concepts of the differential and integral calculus, and identify the critical elements of mathematics instructional practice, both in formal and informal learning environments, that students and teachers consider valuable.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project is funded through the Racial Equity in STEM Education activity (EDU Racial Equity). The activity supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce. Awarded projects seek to center the voices, knowledge, and experiences of the individuals, communities, and institutions most impacted by systemic inequities within the STEM enterprise. This activity aligns with NSF\u2019s core value of supporting outstanding researchers and innovative thinkers from across the Nation's diversity of demographic groups, regions, and types of organizations. Programs across EDU contribute funds to the Racial Equity activity in recognition of the alignment of its projects with the collective research and development thrusts of the four divisions of the directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
