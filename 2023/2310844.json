 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accelerated and real-time data analytics is a leading edge of the smart data revolution, pushed by advances in internet-connected sensor hardware on one side and accelerated AI/ML analytics on the other. These technologies include machine learning, cognitive, quantum, neuromorphic, and edge computing combined with new classes of sensory and programmable hardware components, active storage, advanced FPGA processors, in-memory cloud systems, and embedded sensors. They address many pursuits of national defense and cybersecurity, weather and climate prediction, health/disease monitoring, Industrial IoT, etc. In IUCRC/CARTA Phase II, we develop new accelerated and real-time approaches to address these advanced technologies and their integration relevant to our partners.\r\n\r\nWe leverage cutting-edge research in AI/ML and programmable cyber-systems to conduct collaborative CARTA research. Our research areas include accelerated medical image analytics, explainable and interpretable AI/ML for medical and vision/language models, digital twins for real time dynamical systems, and physics-informed AI/ML modeling for improved understanding. Our research will be primarily \u201capplication neutral,\u201d i.e., techniques that can be applied with modifications across multiple disciplines, including cyber security, healthcare and medical, dynamic systems, environment, and business intelligence. Our exploration will include deep learning, semi/unsupervised learning, federated learning, architectures, real-time simulations, data compliance, and Blockchains. In this context, the CARTA/UMBC site will focus on developing next generation self-learning systems that will leverage High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms to facilitate real-time critical decision-making.\r\n\r\nOur projects will benefit businesses by providing a larger pool of a highly skilled diverse workforce. We disseminate results from our collaborative research widely with industry by publishing in appropriate journals and conferences; share our research outputs with other non-CARTA institutions that want to duplicate this approach. We leverage specialized programs at UMBC, such as our nationally recognized diverse Meyerhoff and Center for Women in Technology (CWIT) scholars programs, to broaden student participation, especially from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
