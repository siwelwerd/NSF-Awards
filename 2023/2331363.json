 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a portable electrohydrodynamic (EHD) inkjet printer for in-space manufacturing and anti-gravity 3D printing.  The proposed EHD technology enables 3D printing using electrical forces to drive liquid-ink flow under a non-gravity or microgravity environment.  The proposed 3D printer is aimed at making high-resolution patterns with high flexibility to adapt substrates and different platforms and production lines, and a high degree of customization of structural designs.  In addition, the proposed technology may support micro-/nano-scale additive manufacturing to migrate from fundamental studies to large-scale production on Earth. The EHD printing system may be modified for flexible electronics and optics fabrication applications, such as flexible sensors and wearable devices.  It is envisioned that the research outcomes may go beyond in-space manufacturing to other fields of micro/nano manufacturing, quality assurance, biomedical science, cyber-physical systems, and sensor design and fabrication.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of electrohydrodynamic (EHD) technology to be used in additive manufacturing (AM) processes.  The proposed EDH printing technology is a micro/nanomanufacturing technique that utilizes the interaction between an electric field and a liquid jet to deposit small droplets of ink onto a substrate. It is a unique technology that can work in non-gravity environments because electrical force is the main driving force for material flow and deposition. This makes the technology a good match for future in-space manufacturing and anti-gravity printing applications.  The proposed process and hardware have been designed to ensure reliable printing performance under extreme conditions such as vibrations, accelerations, and gravitational changes. In addition, this technology has been validated through in-flight tests under microgravity as a part of a series of tests funded by NASA. These explorations may enable new innovations, including on-site AM, electronics repair, hydrodynamics studies, and AM in space or at low earth orbit.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We thought that manufacturing solution companies, who provide the service of producing or prototyping designated objects for customers, are regularly upgrading their printers abilities, and therefore would be interested in bringing in new printing technologies with distinct advantages over traditional manufacturing approaches or the most commonly used 3D printing technologies. EHD printings superb ability to fabricate small objects and features, as well as the abundant available materials could both be remarkable upgrades. On the other hand, in-space research teams would need 3D printing in space stations, as this is an efficient way to convert the limited materials to demanded supplies and accessories. However, the commonly used 3D printing technologies might be problematic to use in space, since the presence of earth gravity is essential to their working mechanisms. Consequently, EHD printing, which does not rely on gravity to work, could be a substitute and fulfill their need.\n\n\n\n\nTowards these two customer segments, we conducted many interviews, and attended the Wisconsin Manufacturing & Technology Show and the International Space Station Research and Development Conference to approach people in these fields. Through the interviews, we managed to acquire a lot of insights from these people. But surprisingly, their opinions did not quite conform to our hypotheses. Firstly, although manufacturing solutions companies do keep upgrading their equipment, they typically have their settled targeted markets, among which few had a high demand for printing resolutions. Also, the material options of their current manufacturing equipment or 3D printers were able to fulfill what they mostly produce, so a versatile 3D printer that can handle many scenarios was not so intriguing to them. On the other hand, we learned from an interviewee who had 3D printing experience in space, that the lack of gravity isnt necessarily a problem for 3D printers in space. There have been successful cases of 3D printing using ordinary fused deposition modeling 3D printers. Therefore, while some interviewees also recognize EHD printings potential in space manufacturing, its hypothesized ace in the hole, which is the strong durability in harsh environments becomes not that unique compared to the other 3D printing technologies.\n\n\n\n\nAfter acquiring this information, we immediately diverted our attention to the market of electronics manufacturing companies. Fine and precise feature sizes for electronic components are often a necessity. EHD printings superb resolution makes it a great candidate for these applications. Through our talk with the interviewees, many of them confirmed that the ultra-high resolution is the most distinct advantages over the other technologies commonly used to produce electronics, such as inkjet printing, aerosol-based jetting, and 3D dispensing.

On the other hand, the throughput rate of EHD printing is the aspect most likely to hinder it from being widely applied. Many commercial inkjet printers already possess a multi-print head system, making them able to produce batches of products at the same time. A similar system would be very beneficial to EHD printers throughput rate. Besides, we also learned some advantages of EHD printing which we initially didnt think of. For example, there are certain printing substrates where inkjet printing is not feasible due to ink reticulation, while EHD printing can do the work due to its Taylor cone jetting mechanism. We concluded that the electronics manufacturing market is very likely where our EHD printing technology can demonstrate its value.
