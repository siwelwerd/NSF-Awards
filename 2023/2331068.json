 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Computing Machinery's Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing is one of the premier venues to acknowledge, promote and celebrate diversity in all parts of the computing field. This award will provide scholarships for the next three years of the conference. Scholarships will facilitate attendance of undergraduate and graduate students, support faculty from minority-serving institutions to attend and participate in conference activities, and provide PhD students with opportunities to engage with diverse leaders in the computing field via a Doctoral Consortium. \r\n\r\nThe technical presentations at Tapia Conferences cover topics such as AI, quantum computing, cybersecurity, high performance computing. Through these technical talks, invited speakers and the Ken Kennedy Distinguished Lecturer provide insights and expertise into emerging and cutting edge computing issues to deepen and broaden the technical knowledge of all attendees. In addition, students are motivated and encouraged to complete their degrees through a range of engagement activities. The conference is organized such that students have opportunities to interact with faculty and professionals, receive advice, and form communities. Finally, Tapia Conference series provides a venue for sharing of good practices and building a robust research community via panels, birds-of-a-feather sessions, and networking opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
