 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EPSCoR Research Fellowship will enable Professor Tolga Karsili and his graduate student to work with Professor Marsha Lester at the University of Pennsylvania to undertake studies on how solar light interacts with hydroperoxyl aldehydes (HPALDs) in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The photochemistry of HPALDs has significant consequences for our atmosphere as they are implicated in the breakdown of harmful hydrocarbons emissions. We will synthesize and undertake state-of-the-art measurements to discover how sunlight perturbs the chemistry of HPALDs and the atmospheric implications of the resulting products. The project will provide excellent opportunities for an underrepresented and first-generation graduate student who will be trained in state-of-the-art photochemical experiments. Through knowledge gained from this collaboration, Professor Karsili will bring the state-of-the-art techniques back to the home institution, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, which is expected to catalyze new collaborations within Louisiana and across other EPSCoR jurisdictions. \r\n\r\nThis Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-4 EPSCoR Research Fellows (RII Track-4) project would provide a fellowship to an Assistant professor and training for a graduate student at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Isoprene is the second most abundant volatile organic compound (after methane) emitted into the troposphere. It is biogenically emitted predominantly in deeply forested regions of our planet, such as the Amazon. Reaction with the hydroxyl (OH) radical represents its dominant removal from the troposphere, where continued chemical processing eventually forms HPALDs. The resulting HPALD decays to form OH radicals upon solar-light irradiation, thus recycling some of the OH radical budget back to the troposphere. These OH radicals are important in enhancing the troposphere's oxidizing capacity and removing hydrocarbon emissions. The overall goal of this proposal is to visit the group of Professor Lester to undertake state-of-the-art velocity map imaging, laser-induced fluorescence, and quantum chemical studies on stabilized HPALDs. The overarching vision is to establish a long-term collaboration that demonstrates new capabilities in the PI\u2019s research profile \u2013 creating a transformative trajectory for the PI\u2019s research career in atmospheric and climate sciences. The research outcome of this project will be integrated into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and will create a promising path toward enhancing atmospheric chemistry research in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
