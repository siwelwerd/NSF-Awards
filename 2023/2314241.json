 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to develop a platform for 3D printing tissue implants for facial surgery. This platform provides the capability to design and rapidly manufacture implants for tissue reconstruction. A comprehensive analysis of the material supply chain will be conducted to identify any potential risks and develop strategies to mitigate them. Additionally, two different 3D printing manufacturing processes will be assessed and optimized to establish an economically viable, and reproducible material/3D printing manufacturing process suitable for commercialization. The technology would benefit both patients and surgeons by providing superior options than current alternatives. Benefits include eliminating painful surgeries, reducing costs and associated risks, and significantly improving patient outcomes. The platform is designed to meet various facial reconstruction needs, as 3D printing enables the production of geometrically complex implants that range from standardized sizes to tailored patient-specific designs. The ultimate goal of this project is to match a readily available medical grade material with a reproducible 3D printing process that can serve as a versatile platform for multiple types of facial implants. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project seeks to evaluate the impact of different 3D printing methods on the cost, time, and most importantly, the performance of 3D printed polycaprolactone (PCL) implants. Additionally, the project aims to understand the variability of manufacturing processes and its effect on the material and mechanical behavior of the manufactured devices. This is critical not only from a research basic point of view, but also from a clinical and commercialization perspective. The project will involve a comprehensive evaluation of commercially available medical-grade PCL powders/pellets using various 3D printing techniques, such as laser sintering and material extrusion. The manufactured devices will undergo material characterization and mechanical testing to assess and compare their performance. Successful completion of this project will create a foundation to enable the production of implants that can be tested in animal models, a necessary step for obtaining FDA clearance to bring these implants to market. This work will not only aid in enhancing our fundamental understanding of the field but will also help identify the most efficient and effective 3D printing technique for producing high-quality PCL-based facial implants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
