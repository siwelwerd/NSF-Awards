 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ninth IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP 2023) will be held in Nashville, TN, USA on June 26-30, 2023.  IEEE SMARTCOMP 2023 conference offers a valuable opportunity to present cutting-edge computing and engineering research results, to learn about the state-of-the-art in smart and connected computing and communities, and to train US-based undergraduate, master\u2019s, doctoral, and post-doctoral students (from computer science and engineering disciplines) through the main conference and other associated events (e.g., student forum, workshops, demo, posters, and industry sessions). SMARTCOMP 23 will be the first in-person meeting since the pandemic and as such will facilitate research collaborations in this important research space.This grant will support the travel of 20 US-based students to attend the IEEE SMARTCOMP 2023 conference in-person in Nashville, TN, USA.  \r\n \r\nSMARTCOMP is the premier conference on smart computing that is emerging as an important multidisciplinary area. Smart Computing can be broadly classified into two major topics: (1) how to design and build smart computing and service systems, and (2) how to use computing and engineering technology for resource sustainability to improve the human experience. Applications of smart computing span trans-disciplinary boundaries such as transportation, energy, sustainability, structural health, environmental protection, healthcare, security, and so on. Advancements in wireless mobile communications, nanotechnology, cyber-physical systems (CPS), internet of things (IoT), sensor networking, cognitive/intelligent systems, control theory, wisdom computing, cloud computing, pervasive computing, and social computing are bringing smart computing and smart service systems to a newer dimension and improving mankind\u2019s quality of life and living experience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
