 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports student for select students participating in the 20th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) and Doctoral Consortium (DC) that will be held in Rhodes, Greece September 2--8, 2023. This is a well-established international conference that facilitates interactions between researchers and practitioners interested in the areas of knowledge representation and reasoning. This activity will bring together a broad community of researchers in the field and support junior researchers at this critical early-career stage. The DC creates the opportunity to bring in participants who might not have attended an AI conference due to lack of resources. This is especially true for those at smaller institutions and those which have less developed AI programs. Engaging such participants has the potential to draw more talent into AI research, improve research ideas in their formative stage, and engender collaborations across the breadth of disciplines. This event provides students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their work at a critical time in their research and enables them to explore their career objectives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
