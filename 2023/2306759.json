 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Fort Valley State University seeks to increase STEM students\u2019 transfer rate from a two-year to a four-year institutions in Georgia and enhance STEM bachelor\u2019s degree attainment among this student population. The activities include institutional, program and individual level interventions to ensure alignment and coordination across campus for the direct benefit students. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to reduce barriers to transfer by leveraging a joint initiative, \u201cThe Complete College Georgia Articulation Agreement\u201d between the University System of Georgia and the Technical College System of Georgia. This project goal will be achieved by implementing a collaborative transfer pathway program for undergraduates, with intentional recruitment strategies targeting minorities student populations, veterans, and/or non-traditional students, to promote the seamless transfer of general science education courses and begin academic support for transfer students even before the transfer occurs. Student success will be achieved through an enhanced STEM education curriculum, a series of well-designed summer workshops, undergraduate research experiences and scientific exchange with peers and other scientists at research conferences. Students will also receive advisement and career guidance in new and high-demand STEM fields. It is anticipated that these activities will facilitate career development, resulting in undergraduates who are better prepared for graduate studies or professional STEM careers. In addition, participating faculty will receive professional development training to hone their mentoring and pedagogical skills. The successful implementation of this project can serve as a model within the higher education landscape, as it examines the impact of its programmatic strategy on an historically overlooked population of STEM students that matriculate from two- to four-year programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
