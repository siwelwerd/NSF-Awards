 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing modules intended to better prepare prospective grade 6-12 mathematics teachers to teach in increasingly diverse classrooms while advancing prospective teachers\u2019 own STEM learning. This project is significant because research indicates that although student populations in U.S. schools are continuing to increase in diversity, specifically with respect to race, language, and socio-economic status, teachers are predominantly white and need additional resources to develop rich STEM learning experiences that impact outcomes for all learners in STEM fields. This project hopes to advance the knowledge of how best to support prospective mathematics teachers in developing the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to teach in diverse settings and contribute to ongoing efforts to increase access to much needed research-based resources for mathematics teacher educators. Mathematics teacher educators' use of these resources should advance prospective mathematics teachers\u2019 own STEM learning which should lead to better mathematics instruction in classrooms across the country. As a result, more grade 6-12 students, particularly students from underrepresented groups, will develop an interest in and be prepared to enter STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThis project will use improvement science methods to design, refine, and study the impact of a series of modules for use in grade 6-12 mathematics teaching methods courses that address prospective teachers\u2019 knowledge, skills, and dispositions for teaching in diverse settings as outlined in Standards for the Preparation of Teachers of Mathematics. Specifically, the project will address two goals as follows: Goal 1. Design and refine a series of modules developed using critical pedagogies to address: a) the political and historical issues in mathematics education, b) identity, c) critical consciousness, and d) countering unproductive practices that marginalize learners by using Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles at three institutions. After the development of each module (Plan), the modules will be enacted in a staggered schedule at each institution (Do) so that between each enactment, data can be shared and analyzed (Study) and revisions can be made (Act). Throughout the design and refinement process advisory board members with expertise in mathematics teacher education, access, equity, culture, justice, curriculum development, and improvement science will provide feedback. The modules will then be shared with mathematics teacher educators who are part of the Mathematics Teacher Education Partnership (which includes 65 programs, including 11 under-resourced institutions and/or minority-serving institutions) for further refinement and subsequently made available to all mathematics teacher educators. Goal 2. Studying the impact of the modules on prospective teachers\u2019 knowledge, skills, and dispositions will be guided by two research questions: RQ1: What impact does participating in the modules have on pre-service teachers' understanding of countering practices that marginalize learners in mathematics? RQ2: How does the consciousness of secondary pre-service teachers shift while engaged in modules on countering beliefs, attitudes, actions and practices that devalue learners in the context of teaching and learning of mathematics? The project will collect quantitative data using content analysis and pre-and post-module data using the Culturally Responsive Teaching Outcome Expectancy and Self-Efficacy surveys and qualitative data from prospective teachers assignments and reflections through coding, thematic analysis, and using Mathematics with|in conocimientos to determine how the modules influenced prospective teachers\u2019 multicultural mathematics dispositions, other emergent understandings related to cultural sensitivity, and how prospective teachers\u2019 experiences with the modules created changes in their consciousness. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program has contributed funding to this project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
