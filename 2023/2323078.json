 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing, implementing, and studying the effectiveness of early research experiences for two-year college chemistry and biology students at Georgia State University, Perimeter College, a predominantly Black institution. Perimeter College (PC) is and an associate degree granting institution within Georgia State University (GSU) that functions as a typical community college. The new approach will be of broad importance as it is intended to engage students in authentic mentored research activities that connect chemistry and biology learning to students\u2019 lived experiences. Importantly, this project aims to use readily available instrumentation combined with student stipends to engage students in a multi-year research experience. On-going research opportunities will be made available to students on their home campus and will utilize the collective expertise of college faculty to guide projects. The project team plans to measure the impact of the research experiences on students\u2019 development of identity and self-efficacy in STEM and aims to widely share project materials and study results. Ultimately, the project will transform the way the institution prepares students to transfer to a four-year university and is likely to build the confidence that students need to successfully engage in more rigorous research experiences.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to strengthen student STEM identities and interest in STEM careers by engaging two-year college chemistry and biology students in research experiences during their first and second year of the college experience. The specific objectives of the project are to: 1) create adaptable research opportunities using resources typically found at two-year institutions; 2) utilize stipends to incentivize participation in STEM research; 3) provide resources and opportunities for participation in undergraduate research symposiums; and 4) explore how participation in research may impact STEM identity among two-year college students from a wide variety of backgrounds. The project team will partner with an external evaluator to capture the student experience and assess the impact of early research experiences on students\u2019 interest in STEM, their readiness to engage in other research experiences, and their development of STEM identity over time. The results of the project will be disseminated broadly to the 2-year college STEM community. The NSF program description on Advancing Innovation and Impact in Undergraduate STEM Education at Two-year Institutions of Higher Education supports projects that advance STEM education initiatives at two-year colleges. The program description promotes innovative and evidence-based practices in undergraduate STEM education at two-year colleges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
