A hallmark of the SB3C is a focus on student and trainee involvement (approximately half of attendees are trainees). The conference will highlight student achievements in research through a Student Paper Competition as well as connect trainees with mentors through events such as the Diversity Mentor-Mentee session. Funding will be used to offset registration and travel costs for undergraduate and graduate students majoring in a STEM field, with special consideration given to members of groups underrepresented in STEM. Registration costs for the students selected to participate in the BS Student Paper Competition and MS Student Paper Competition will be waived, which will enable students who might not ordinarily be able to attend the conference to compete in these research competitions. The conference will also feature a Diversity Reception and Diversity Mentor-Mentee Workshop, led by a professional facilitator.\r\n\r\nThe SB3C is a leading bioengineering conference held annually that promotes state-of-the-art research, collaboration, and scientific discourse in bioengineering; showcases research from students and trainees; and provides essential networking and mentoring opportunities across disciplines and levels of seniority. The conference will include over 40 podium sessions, 4 plenary/award lecture sessions, 10 workshops, and numerous reception and networking events. The objectives of the conference are: (i) enhance access to bioengineering research and education opportunities, particularly for underrepresented groups (ii) improve interfaces across basic research and translation, including biomechanics, bioengineering, and biotransport; and (iii) develop emerging bioengineering fields with high translational potential.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
