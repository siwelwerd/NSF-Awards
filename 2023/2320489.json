 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs.  Howard University is acquiring a 500 MHz solution and solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with a broadband probe and a triple-resonance solids probe to support the research of Professor Steven Cummings along with colleagues Amol Kulkami, Dharmaraj Raghavan, Sung Kim, and Timothy Ramadhar. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of catalyst design, biochemistry, polymer chemistry, nanomaterials, and medicinal chemistry. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and research training at all levels in multiple departments at Howard University, a Historically Black University (HBCU).  This instrument further propagates research and educational opportunities between the Minority-Serving Institutions in the region including Morgan State University, Bowie State University, and Gallaudet University.  \r\n\r\nThe award of the 500 MHz NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as characterizations of metal-organic frameworks, biological systems and materials, and nanoparticles. Specifically, the instrument impacts research focused on fusing carborane chemistry with carbene and pyridinate ligands.  The instrument is also used for structural investigations of complex bioactive compounds by structural and mechanistic analysis of the crystalline sponge method.  Additionally, this instrument enables the composition analysis of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm.  Other investigations include the metabolome and composition analysis of exosome in search of markers for Type 1 diabetes, and the determination of the binding mode of small molecules to the protein NLRP3 inflammasome. In response to global helium supply challenges and the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, the acquisition of this instrument includes a superconducting magnet with a low loss cryostat reducing the institution\u2019s consumption of helium.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
