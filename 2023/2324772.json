 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists and mathematicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need through the formation of the Artemis Scholarship Program at Hollins University, a women's college located in Roanoke, Virginia. Over its six-year duration, this project will fund scholarships of up to $8,200 to 18 unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in biology, environmental science, chemistry, and mathematics. This project will provide scholarships and supports that increase the preparation, retention, belonging, and self-efficacy of women in STEM through pre-orientation, faculty and alumnae/i mentoring, a research course, research and internships, cohort activities, leadership training, and career development services. Faculty mentors will receive professional development to improve their ability to support scholars. Hollins' pool of prospective scholars has a high percentage of both minority students who are underrepresented in their participation in STEM fields of study and first-generation students. Thus, improving their retention and graduation in STEM majors is likely to broaden participation in the targeted disciplines. Beyond the scholars, other STEM students will benefit from the new 2-credit leadership course, a January term research design and methods course, and a summer research experience. Recruitment will bolster the pipeline of low-income high school women interested in STEM and improve their awareness of STEM careers and project scholarships will increase the accessibility of a Hollins education for low-income women by reducing their financial burden.\r\n\r\nThe project objectives are to (1) recruit and enroll 18 eligible students in the targeted majors; (2) eliminate their unmet financial need up to $15,000; (3) increase their academic self-efficacy and reduce imposter syndrome; (4) increase their connections with peers, faculty, and alumnae/i; (5) increase their understanding of career paths; and (6) guide scholars through their degree programs and into graduate study or the STEM workforce. Artemis will add to the knowledge base by evaluating the effectiveness of pre-orientation activities, academic supports, faculty and alumnae/i mentoring, a research course, research and internships, social activities, and leadership training in fostering senses of belonging, self-efficacy, and self-advocacy and reducing imposter syndrome in women in STEM. A detailed participatory evaluation, coupled with reflective focus groups, will involve the scholars in investigating the effectiveness of leadership training, mentoring, and other key project components. Outcomes and project components will be disseminated to communities of interest. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
