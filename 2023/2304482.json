 "awd_abstract_narration": "This broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop coatings for walls and ceilings that have climate-regulating properties, resulting in improved energy efficiency, durability, and comfort for buildings. Buildings account for around 40% of primary energy consumption in the United States, and while increasing insulation and airtightness can lower energy costs, this also increases vulnerability to moisture damage. Inadequate moisture management has significant costs, and over one third of U.S. structures experience damp conditions that promote the growth of harmful pollutants like mold and bacteria. Moreover, water is a major cause of failure of building materials. Multifunctional coatings provide a solution that can be incorporated in a straightforward manner into both new constructions and retrofits.\r\n\r\nThe architectural coatings to be developed in this project have commercial potential and will make a broad impact because they will provide a cost-effective solution to the interconnected challenges of humidity control, thermal efficiency, and moisture durability. The coatings use the high energy storage capacity of moisture storage materials, mimicking how plants use water to regulate their temperature through transpiration.  The research will focus on optimizing the formulations of a primer and a topcoat so that they work together as a multifunctional material system capable of effectively managing the flows of water vapor and heat. A first function of the system is to provide directional control over vapor diffusion in the manner of a vapor diode.  This diode will create a pumping effect that actively removes moisture from the wall cavity and enhances a building's durability. A second function of the coatings is to buffer the humidity in the building, which increases comfort. A final function is to store and release significant amounts of latent heat as water vapor evaporates and condenses within its structure, which reduces temperature fluctuations and energy consumption required for climate control.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The coating system mimics the way plants use water to regulate humidity, temperature, and moisture levels through evapotranspiration. Adepts coating system is meant to replace conventional decorative paints on interior walls and ceilings to improve the energy efficiency, durability, and comfort of buildings.\n\n\n Adept Materials first formulated a waterborne topcoat with a high capacity for storing and releasing water vapor. The topcoat can store over 14% of its dry weight in water, which means every gallon of paint applied to the walls of a home can adsorb and sequester about 12 oz of water. That is comparable with the quantity of excess water vapor released by a hot shower, which tends to condense on the walls and create conditions for mold growth. Adept Materials overcame several technical challenges to endow the paint with such a high moisture storage capacity using commercially available raw materials and standard procedures, while also ensuring that the formulation looks and behaves like a premium decorative paint.\n\n\n Adept Materials next formulated a waterborne primer that acts like a valve for water vapor. The valve is needed to prevent water vapor from accumulating inside the wall or ceiling cavities, where mold growth and moisture damage could result. Adept Materials overcame additional technical challenges in formulating a primer that could simultaneously form a smooth film on a variety of surfaces, adhere well to our topcoat paint, and control the rate at which water vapor diffuses through the primer by more than a factor of fifty.\n\n\n When the topcoat paint is applied on the primer, the coatings work in concert to manage the flows of water vapor and heat in beneficial ways. Adept Materials experimentally validated those key functions. The coatings strongly regulate the humidity and suppress condensation, even in the challenging environment of a bathroom during a hot shower. The topcoat paint layer sequesters away excess moisture when the humidity is high and only releases it when the humidity falls to safer levels. Importantly, the paint discharges the stored moisture away from the wall or ceiling cavity thanks to the effect of the primer. The directional control of moisture that the primer and paint system provides should protect the building from moisture damage.\n\n\n In the next phase of development, Adept Materials will refine the paint and primer formulations to meet the highest standards of aesthetics, VOC content, washability, and scrub resistance. Adept Materials will also field test its paint and primer system to demonstrate its efficacy at suppressing mold-growth conditions in a real-world setting.\n\n\nBroader Impacts.\n\n\n The paint and primer formulations that Adept Materials developed in this project have commercial potential and can make a broad impact by providing a cost-effective solution to the interconnected challenges of humidity control, thermal efficiency, and moisture durability. The properties of the paint and primer are particularly well suited for suppressing mold and moisture damage in bathrooms, which represents an excellent beachhead market for Adept Materials to target.
