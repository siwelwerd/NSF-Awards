 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal seeks to support participation of US-based mathematicians, especially those in the early stages of career, at the international conference \"Finite Dimensional Integrable Systems 2023, to be held at the University of Antwerp, Belgium, on August 7-11, 2023. The conference will bring together leading experts, early-career researchers, and graduate students in this far-reaching and fast-growing area of research. The conference web site is  \r\nhttps://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/personeel/sonja-hohloch/private-webpage/conference-workshop/fdis2023/\r\n\r\nThe conference focuses on recent progress in the study of integrable systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom, a subfield of the theory of completely integrable systems that grew out of the now classical work of Lagrange, Jacobi, Kovalevskaya, Noether, Poincare, and others. In the second half of 20th century, KAM theory, due to Kolmogorov, Arnold and Moser, revealed new perspectives on integrability problems, stimulating progress in the area and the development of powerful techniques that bridge mathematics and physics.  These have resulted in the discovery of new kinds of integrable systems, broader applications in physics and geometry, and solutions to long-standing open questions. The conference will survey recent progress in the field, present new directions of research and applications, and foster collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
