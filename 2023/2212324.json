 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports US-Israel collaborative research that contributes to new knowledge related to the manufacturing of silicon technology compatible nanomagnets, which is important for basic science, national prosperity and national security. Silicon technology compatible nanomagnets are needed for spintronics, which enable low-power, high-density data storage and processing critical for next-generation nano- and micro-electronic devices. This impacts a wide variety of technological applications in commercial and defense industries. A bottom-up approach based on controlled self-assembly of nanoislands on a silicon substrate is used to fabricate transition metal silicide nanostructures. The processing-structure-property relationships are systematically investigated to tailor the magnetic properties of the nanosilicides. The fundamental knowledge generated by the project contributes to the discovery and development of novel magnetic nanomaterials for future silicon-based technology. Further, the magnetic transition metal silicides provide new alternatives to rare earth magnets to ease national security and environmental threat posed by rare earth elements. In addition, bottom-up fabrication has the potential for scale-up to cost-effective high-throughput mass production that is compatible with current industrial silicon semiconductor processes. The project involves four principal investigators with complementary expertise in computation and experiment. It establishes collaboration in the areas of advanced nanofabrication and nanomagnetism between US and Israeli researchers, helps connect broader research and education communities from the two countries and positively impacts the participation of women and underrepresented minority groups in research. \r\n\r\nThe project seamlessly integrates computation with experiment. Computation research involves first-principles density functional theory calculations and micromagnetic simulations bridged by atomistic spin model simulations. Experimental research involves controlled material synthesis, growth of self-assembled epitaxial silicide nanoislands on a silicon substrate, in-situ/ex-situ structural and compositional characterization and magnetic property measurement. This integrated multiscale approach is used to study self-assembled nanosilicides on Si substrates produced by epitaxial deposition and heat treatment of elemental iron and cobalt as well as their commercially available magnetic alloys, such as Permalloy (NiFe) and Permendur (FeCo). The research aims to explore new magnetic phenomena in nanosilicides, understand the mechanisms for the dependence of magnetic properties on the structure, morphology and spatial arrangement of silicide nanoisland assemblies, identify optimum structures and realize them via computation-guided nanomaterials processing. The project provides insights into developing new nanomagnets by design for potential applications in next-generation Si-based spintronics and other nanodevices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
