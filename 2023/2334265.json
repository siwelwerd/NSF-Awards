 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an ExpandAI Partnership between the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez (UPRM) and the AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI) In this project, a minority-serving institution leads a new collaboration with an AI Institute focused on scaling up already-established research and education programs at UPRM and to pursue shared, complementary goals around developing AI with use for society in mind and for developing the next generation of AI education and workforce talent. The collaborative research focuses on the development of AI for contributing to breakthroughs in high-energy physics experiments. The project will also build community and new centers of excellence in AI where such activities were not previously well developed.  \r\n\r\nThe present era is witnessing scientific discoveries where Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a decisive role in giving insights into data. The recent explosion of deep learning techniques matched by continuously evolving computing architectures has enabled AI tools to handle higher-dimensional and more complex problems than previously achievable efficiently. The complex, high dimensional data collected by high-energy physics experiments like those at the Large Hadron Collider provide for convergent research in physics and AI. This research is structured around the following AI themes: Optimal Transport in Deep Learning, Physics Informed Uncertainty Quantization, Sparse Dictionary Learning, and Computational aspects of Deep Learning. The intent is to enhance data reduction by transforming the information in the low-level, high-dimensional space into a higher-level and lower-dimensional representation. It will also benefit imaging by enhancing sparse learning, classification, image super-resolution, spectral unmixing, and segmentation. The project emphasizes inclusive participatory design to promote positive societal outcomes of AI innovation. A key goal of the research partnership between UPRM and IAIFI is to significantly increase participation of UPRM in AI research, education, and workforce development. It leverages ongoing research at UPRM on the Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment at the LHC, the Artificial Intelligence Imaging Group\u2019s work on AI research and applications in hyperspectral and biomedical imaging, and IAIFI expertise on advancing foundational AI through novel approaches. The project is partially funded by NSF\u2019s Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program within the Division of Equity for Excellence in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
