 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is improved automotive transportation safety, usability, and equity for the general public which reduces the annual 5,300 fatalities, 418,000 injuries, and billion-dollar losses from inclement weather crashes in the United States. The technology identifies the driving lane using camera data processing in challenging driving conditions such as congested intersections and bridges, dark tunnels, and during sun glare and active snowfall. Addressing these problems also enables U.S. technology competitiveness in the global automotive market, development of technologies relevant to national defense and energy efficiency applications, expansions of existing university courses, and entrepreneurial engagement from underrepresented communities. The foundation for the proposed research is the utilization of camera and global positioning data specifically for navigation in snow using real-time machine learning methods without an overreliance on deep learning. This technology can be implemented in current vehicles, enabling a widespread commercial impact and a strong means to grow a viable business that is generating tax revenue and offering technology jobs to the local community.\r\n\r\nThe strong technical innovation of this work is a hierarchical computer vision system built using a resilience engineering methodology, individually tuned classifications, camera and GPS fusion, and fast processing machine learning. This system provides verification of successful performance with respect to human-observed ground truth without an overreliance on deep learning so that it can be successfully validated by automotive companies using standard practices. This innovation allows current driving assistance products to remain functional when they are needed most: in low visibility, low traction situations. This research aims to verify the innovation in two-lane intersections, bridges, tunnels, under sun glare conditions, in 100+ miles of active snowfall, and in instances of misleading environmental information. Data for these instances will be collected and the existing technology will be modified and improved.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
