 "awd_abstract_narration": "A well-known shortcoming in the nation's scientific infrastructure is the disparity of opportunity among scientists and researchers. This project provides forums for researchers from institutions with different levels of resources to create networks and collaborations and receive mentoring. The project builds upon previous research on intersectionality and police-civilian interactions, using an experimental design to advance the science concerning civilian reactions to police officers. It contributes to our understanding of the intersections of race, gender, and policing. It also advances the science of the political dynamics of the relationship between a country and a territory, furthering the prior (small body of) work on the preferences and views of citizens residing in such territories. Finally, the research advances the science of differences between perceptions of rural versus urban residents who are beneficiaries of public spending, expanding knowledge about general attitudes toward the recipients of government aid. The project supports networks and collaborations, mentoring, and funding for pilot projects. These opportunities can also help draw more undergraduates into the pipeline of students entering social science and STEM graduate programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
