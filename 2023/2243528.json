 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the Second South Central Topology Conference (SCTC II) to be held at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas, on the weekend of February 11-12, 2023. The primary goals of this regional conference include developing a community of collaborators of varied interests in topology in the region, disseminating current research directions in topology in the South Central region and beyond, and continuing to create the foundations for a vibrant future for topology in the region. This conference is timely in light of the growing research activity in topology within the South Central Region.\r\n\r\nThe conference will be broad in its focus providing a representative sample of recent research developments in fields such as Stable Homotopy Theory, Tropical Geometry, Representation Stability, K-theory and Higher Category Theory, Symplectic Geometry, and Low-dimensional Topology. The six plenary speakers, Prasit Bhattacharya (New Mexico State University), Kalina Mincheva (Tulane University), Peter Patzt (University of Oklahoma), Maru Sarazola (Johns Hopkins University), Shira Tanny (Institute for Advanced Study), and Melissa Zhang (UC Davis), will give one-hour colloquium-style presentations. There will also be eight short talks given by graduate students and postdocs on a wide range of topics. The conference web page is https://www.hiroleetanaka.com/sctc/.\r\n\r\nPlease report errors in award information by writing to: awardsearch@nsf.gov.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
