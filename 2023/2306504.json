 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. This project aims to implement online, experiential Information and Electronics Technology courses using innovative technologies such as augmented and virtual reality at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical University.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective is to investigate the impact of these courses on student success, retention, and engagement, particularly among postsecondary students from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. This project contributes to advancing the knowledge of future recruiters and researchers. It sheds light on the efficacy of augmented and virtual reality to enhance online STEM education in general and at HBCUs in specific. The merit of this project lies in its pioneering use of cutting-edge strategies to bolster the enrollment of students in technology programs at HBCUs and other institutions of higher education. By promoting innovation and addressing the projected shortage of skilled STEM professionals in the United States, the project aligns with the overarching goal of driving economic growth and fostering a more robust STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
