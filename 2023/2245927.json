This will be the 16th annual meeting of the GSCC, which is traditionally organized by graduate students. The GSCC focuses on graduate student research presentations and will include keynote addresses by David Galvin (University of Notre Dame), Megumi Harada (McMaster University), and Pamela E. Harris (University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee). The GSCC provides a unique and invaluable opportunity for graduate students in combinatorics to experience the benefits of taking part in a research conference. Giving their own presentations allows graduate students to develop their formal presentation skills, helping them succeed as junior researchers.\r\n \r\nCombinatorics is a vibrant area for new and innovative research involving problems and techniques from within algebra, geometry, topology, probability, computer science, and analysis. This conference will keep junior researchers aware of recent advances, and give them a platform to present their own research. The GSCC provides an opportunity for graduate students to network, frequently leading to joint research projects and opportunities for future collaboration.\r\nWebsite: https://sites.google.com/view/gscc2023/home\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
