 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical description:\r\nAn ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor is a material that has a wide bandgap, typically greater than 4.0 eV. One of the key benefits of UWBG semiconductors is their ability to handle high power densities without suffering from breakdown or other forms of degradation. Another benefit of these semiconductors is their ability to operate at higher voltages and frequencies than traditional semiconductors. This makes them ideal for use in high-power electronics, such as power converters, inverters, rectifiers and high frequency devices. They are also highly resistant to radiation and high temperatures, which makes them well-suited for use in aerospace and defense applications. This project focuses on the synthesis and characterization of such a material - a group-IV oxide-based wide bandgap semiconductor. This project will further contribute to the professional development experience for students from local high schools, minority organizations and community colleges through education, training and hands-on workshops. \r\n\r\nTechnical description:\r\nCrystal structure and chemical bonding can have profound impact on the structural and electrical properties of a semiconductor. Through a systematic approach, this project is investigating the synthesis of group-IV oxide-based wide bandgap semiconductors with high purity, controlled structure and well-characterized intrinsic defect concentrations as an essential component to realize a next-generation platform for high-mobility, high-power devices. In particular, the project is investigating these structures in detailed structural and electronic transport studies to exploit strain engineering of these materials, and to understand, and control defects (specifically dislocations and point defects), local structure, and electronic mobility.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
