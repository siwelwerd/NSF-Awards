Immediately following the DASH Conference, a paired International Heliophysics Data Environment Alliance (IHDEA) meeting will be held, and this travel grant will be extended to DASH attendees who also plan on attending the IHDEA meeting. This meeting is the first  dedicated meeting about analysis techniques, data, metadata, services, and software. The travel grants will be used to increase attendance among early career and post-doctoral attendees, as well as attendees from smaller institutions that lack travel money, in order to increase the impact and reach of the conference and increase the diversity of attendees.\r\n\r\nThe Data, Analysis, and Software in Heliophysics (DASH) conference will serve as a starting point for researchers within heliophysics to come together and discuss challenges associated with the wide variety of data sources and to build cross-disciplinary relationships and collaborations. The heliophysics research community is diverse, with science concepts ranging from the physics of the Sun, space plasma interactions, magnetosphere and ionosphere dynamics and coupling, and even ground level effects such as the flow of induced currents. Members of the heliophysics community will benefit from the attending the DASH conference and this travel award will enable early-career and postdoctoral researchers, who might not otherwise be able to attend due to limited travel funding, to participate in the discussions, share their research, discuss challenges, and strengthen their collaborative network. Travel award criteria will be developed and vetted by the DASH committee and will include need, relevance, career stage, and equity considerations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
