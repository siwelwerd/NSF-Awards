 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a next-generation landmine detection biosensor that can be distributed in a wide range of fields, in various environmental conditions. The project's primary goal is to provide a safe and efficient method to detect landmines, which are often buried and camouflaged, causing a significant threat to both military forces and civilians. The current detection methods are outdated and risky, requiring physical on-site presence, and they are also costly. Therefore, the proposed project aims to provide a more efficient and cost-effective solution by utilizing genetic engineering, microbiology, and biochemical approaches. The innovative biosensor system will employ two biosensors that are engineered to use TNT/DNT and toluene as the sole nitrogen-source and carbon source, respectively, to detect landmines and generate fluorescent signals that can be amplified several folds for easy detection.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a highly sensitive landmine detection biosensor. The proposed biosensor will employ bioreporter, genetic engineering, microbiology, and biochemical approaches. The key features of this technology include (1) signal amplification, (2) extreme environment adaptation, and (3) TNT/DNT-response. The project's potential benefits extend beyond landmine detection and clearance, as it can enhance our understanding of bio- and nano-technology in explosive detection. It can also contribute to socioeconomic development by providing a cost-effective solution for detecting landmines globally, where there are currently an estimated 100 million landmines in the ground, and mine action costs exceed $500 million annually. Therefore, this innovative landmine biosensor system can potentially reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by the buried landmines and promote socioeconomic development in affected regions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This biosensor system (1) can be delivered on a wide scale to current minefields; (2) has a high degree of sensitivity; (3) can produce amplified signals for detection easily and rapidly; (4) has a biological sensor that itself is safe by making each biological unit self-limiting; (5) can reduce the cost to produce biosensors; and (6) does not require physical presence.\r\n\n\nFor years, the detection of landmine relies on the traditional metal detector and this technique requires the presence of the deminer in the field. However, the physical presence of the deminer always leads to very high casualties. For example, at least 4,710 people were killed or injured by landmines or explosive remnants in 2022. Furthermore, false positive is also a major issue for this technique. Since the main explosive component of landmine is trinitrotoluene (TNT), targeted genetic engineering approach and random mutagenesis approach have been used for the construction of either bacterial or non-bacterial biosensor for TNT detection. However, the microorganisms that hosted these bioreporters are not robust enough for an extensive application in the field. The signal released from the microorganism is very weak and this increases the difficulty to detect the signal. Furthermore, they are opportunistic pathogens and might potentially cause environmental contamination.\r\n\n\nTo circumvent the concerns, we have chosen the environmentally safe, natural soil bacteria Pseudomonas putida, as our biosensor host. Our design can produce a landmine detection biosensor system with a highly sensitive bioreporter. This biosensor system can produce amplified signals and can survive under extreme environment.
