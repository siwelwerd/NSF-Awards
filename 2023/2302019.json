 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Combinatorial Algebra meets Algebraic Combinatorics (CAAC) conference will take place at the University of Waterloo from 20 to 22 of January, 2023. The CAAC is an annual three-day interdisciplinary conference for mathematicians that brings together algebraists interested in discrete mathematics and combinatoricists interested in algebra. The conference focuses on the interplay between algebra and combinatorics and their applications to other areas of mathematics and science. The 20th iteration of CAAC will bring together the mathematical research communities of Canada and the United States, as well as some mathematicians from other continents. CAAC strives to be an inclusive conference that promotes collaboration, development of young talent, and progress in this field.\r\n\r\nCAAC 2023 will feature presentations on a wide array of topics in combinatorial algebra, algebraic combinatorics, and their applications. These topics include Newton-Okounkov bodies, chromatic symmetric functions, enumeration, cluster algebras, monomial ideals, dynamical algebraic combinatorics, plethysm, toric varieties, and geometric vertex decomposition. There will also be a poster session for early-career participants to share their work. More details are available on the conference website, https://sites.google.com/view/caac2023/home.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
