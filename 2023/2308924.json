 "awd_abstract_narration": "The brain is arguably the most sophisticated and the most efficient computational machine in the universe. The human brain, for example, comprises about 100 billion neurons that form an interconnected circuit with well over 100 trillion connections. Understanding how a multitude of brain functions emerge from the underlying neuronal circuit will give insights into the operating principles of the brain. In this award, a multidisciplinary team of systems biologist, computational biologist, material scientist, neuroscientist, and machine learning expert will work synergistically to leverage the data revolution in neuroscience to answer a fundamental question: How does the brain learn, store, and process information?  The team will develop and apply advanced data analysis algorithms to harness the great volume of neuronal data generated by the latest imaging and molecular profiling technologies, for elucidating the neuronal circuits driving brain functions. Computer simulations of a spin-electronic (spintronic) device will further serve as a platform to validate and emulate important operational characteristics of such neuronal circuits. The award sets the groundwork for an interdisciplinary data science research and educational program that will bring a new and powerful paradigm for studying brain functions as well as for designing transformative brain-inspired devices for information processing, data storage, computing, and decision making.\r\n\r\nThe project has a specific focus on an essential function of the brain: motor-skill learning. This function emerges from the underlying circuitry of neurons that governs the activities of molecular signal transmission and neuronal firing. Importantly, the neuronal circuit in a mammalian brain is highly plastic and dynamic, features that endow animals with the ability to respond to myriad external stimulations through learning. By harnessing the latest data revolution in neuronal imaging, single neuron molecular profiling, spintronic device simulation, network inference, and machine learning, a team of multidisciplinary investigators will be supported by this award to investigate the fundamental principle of neuronal circuit rewiring that drives brain?s learning function. More specifically, the team sets out to achieve the following specific tasks: (A) Infer learning-induced rewiring of large-scale neuronal networks from two-photon calcium imaging data through the development of novel and powerful network inference algorithms; (B) Build biochemical-based models of neuronal circuits by integrating molecular profiling with neuron firing and connectome dynamics; and (C) Develop a spintronic material network model that emulates learning and memory formation by exploiting the spin dynamics in spintronic materials. The project seeks to lay the foundation for the creation of an interdisciplinary data-intensive brain-to-materials initiative that will be applied to understand and emulate the operational principles of brain neuronal circuits underlying learning, cognition, memory formation, and other behaviors. The outcomes of the initiative will have a paramount impact on the society, not only in our understanding of the brain and its functions, but also in overcoming current bottlenecks of existing computing architectures.  This project is part of the National Science Foundation's Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR) Big Idea activity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Meanwhile, this project also extended and deepened research obtained from motor-skill learning to civil engineering areas, thus expanding the application of the proposed methods. Two overarching outcomes of this interdisciplinary, comprehensive study that reflect the intellectual merit and broader impacts are 1) a highly multidisciplinary effort that aims at driving the advancement of neuroscience and civil engineering by harnessing the data-driven methods in neural decoding, structural response modeling, and mix design; 2) an interdisciplinary education system to STEM students to enhances their ability to learn from multiple perspectives through problem-based learning, collaborative learning, and problem-solving skills.</p>\n<p class=\"Content\">1. This project utilized deep learning to decode movement trajectories from motor cortical neuron activity. It evaluated deep learning methods across three different decoding schemes: concurrent, time-delay, and spatiotemporal. In the concurrent scheme, where neural activity coincided with movement, artificial neural networks (ANN) and long-short term memory networks (LSTM) were applied and compared with traditional machine learning algorithms. Both ANN and LSTM were also assessed in the time-delay scheme, which allowed temporal delays between neural signals and movements. For the spatiotemporal scheme, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to extract movement information from images representing neuron spatial arrangements, their activity, and connectomes. A hybrid spatiotemporal network combining CNN and ANN was developed. Sensitivity analysis was performed on the hybrid network to identify the spatial regions relevant to movement decoding. The results showed that deep learning networks (ANN and LSTM) outperformed traditional machine learning algorithms in the concurrent scheme. In the time-delay scheme, using neural data from preceding time points enabled more robust performance when the temporal relationship between neural activity and movement changed dynamically. In the spatiotemporal scheme, the hybrid network with the concurrent ANN decoder outperformed single-network concurrent decoders. Overall, these findings demonstrated that deep learning could be a robust and effective method for neural decoding of behavior.</p>\n<p class=\"Content\">2. The project developed a physics-informed long short-term memory (PI-LSTM) network for structural response modeling by integrating physics constraints into deep learning. These constraints were adapted to address both linear and nonlinear cases. The PI-LSTM network was validated using numerical simulation results of a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system and experimental data from a six-story building. Additionally, the PI-LSTM network was rigorously evaluated across four different SDOF system scenarios and numerical simulations of the six-story building, with comparisons made to a regular LSTM network. The results showed that the PI-LSTM network outperformed the regular LSTM models in terms of accuracy. Moreover, the PI-LSTM network demonstrated a more concentrated and higher accuracy range when analyzing both the SDOF system and the six-story building. Therefore, these findings indicate that the PI-LSTM network could provide a reliable and efficient approach for structural response modeling.</p>\n<p class=\"Content\">3. This project made use of the predictive capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to accelerate or optimize current asphalt pavement material design. The studies can be categorized into direct and indirect approaches based on whether AI is used directly to model the optimal mixture proportion (e.g., asphalt content) or not. The direct approach was to develop different machine learning (ML) models to model effective and absorbed asphalt content with the inputs of component properties, air void, and gyration number. The indirect approach regarded the mix design process as an optimization problem and Markov decision process with the prediction of the physical lab tests by ML and deep learning (DL) algorithm including volumetric properties, dynamic modulus, and pavement distress (rutting, international roughness index, and cracking). Typical optimization algorithms, such as the Genetic Algorithm, Grey Wolf Optimization, and Particle Swarm Optimization, and deep reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, were used to search for the candidate mix designs. The research on AI-based pavement material design offered significant benefits to infrastructure construction contractors by providing a tool to automatically design infrastructure materials quickly and cost-effectively, reducing the need for extensive laboratory tests. This will not only save costs and labor but also allow construction projects to start earlier and transition more swiftly to new projects. Among the six journal articles in these area, two of them have awarded the 2nd place in the Long-Term-Pavement-Performance data analysis competition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Content\">Summary: Overall, this interdisciplinary project demonstrated the effectiveness of AI technologies in advancing both neuroscience and civil engineering, while also contributing to the development of an innovative and multidisciplinary educational framework for STEM students. The project resulted in ten journal publications and supporting two Ph.D. students to completion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Content\">&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/30/2024<br>\nModified by: Linbing&nbsp;Wang</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2308924/2308924_10642934_1722338342197_Physics_informed_AI_based_structural_response_modeling--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2308924/2308924_10642934_1722338342197_Physics_informed_AI_based_structural_response_modeling--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"AI-based neural decoding\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2308924/2308924_10642934_1722338342197_Physics_informed_AI_based_structural_response_modeling--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"AI-based neural decoding\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">AI-based neural decoding</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Fangyu Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Linbing&nbsp;Wang\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">AI-based neural decoding</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2308924/2308924_10642934_1722338213809_AI_based_neural_decoding--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2308924/2308924_10642934_1722338213809_AI_based_neural_decoding--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"AI-based neural decoding\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2308924/2308924_10642934_1722338213809_AI_based_neural_decoding--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"AI-based neural decoding\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">AI-based neural decoding</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Linbing Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Linbing&nbsp;Wang\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">AI-based neural decoding</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2308924/2308924_10642934_1722338459314_AI_based_mix_design--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2308924/2308924_10642934_1722338459314_AI_based_mix_design--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"AI-based mix design\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2308924/2308924_10642934_1722338459314_AI_based_mix_design--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"AI-based mix design\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">AI-based mix design</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jian Liu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Linbing&nbsp;Wang\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">AI-based mix design</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
