 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future Earth is a globally connected science-based organization working to transform societal decision making so that it is informed by integrated, accessible, and co-developed knowledge. The US Global Hub of Future Earth advances this process by supporting transdisciplinary, transnational research, making innovative yet plausible sustainability options accessible to a public audience, and providing a platform for inclusive dialogues and skill building to create an ever-broadening network of experts moving knowledge to action. This project supports the U.S. Hub\u2019s strategic leadership of these activities within the constellation of Future Earth offices as well as the global engagement and translation efforts that raise the visibility and uptake of sustainability science options worldwide.\r\n\r\nAs a partner of the Belmont Forum, Future Earth mobilizes and grows the global transdisciplinary research community, advancing themes at the nexus of science and society, and supporting the inclusion of knowledge from underrepresented groups in the scoping, resourcing, and communication of these themes. To provide this community somewhere to convene, the US Hub staff have led the co-design and delivery of the Sustainability Research and Innovation Congress, the world\u2019s largest annual sustainability science event, which brings together experts from across sectors and geographies in a hybrid, multi-continent format that emphasizes action and interaction over passive learning. Emerging sustainability innovations, green technology, and socio-technical advances are featured in the award-winning Anthropocene Magazine, Fixing Carbon newsletter, and a new futures anthology edited and produced by the Future Earth US Hub. These and other Future Earth initiatives are further supported through a member portal that amplifies exchange not only across the 9 Global Hubs, 27 Global Research Networks, and 19 National Committees, but with international science coordination, science policy, and implementation partners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
