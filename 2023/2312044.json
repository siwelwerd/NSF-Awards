 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Mathematics at the University of Notre Dame will run a 2023 program on Hyperbolicity and Rationality and a 2024 program on Commutative Algebra and its Interaction with Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Combinatorics. The 2023 program will take place June 12-30, 2023. The first week of will be an undergraduate summer school on topics relating to hyperbolicity and rationality, the second week will be a graduate/postdoc summer school to give new researchers an introduction to this field, and the third week will be an international research conference. The 2024 program will be an international research conference that will take place August 12-19, 2024. The goal of both programs is to allow mathematicians at different levels to engage with these exciting and fast-developing fields. The purpose of the summer schools is to introduce students at various levels to important ideas in algebraic geometry, and more specifically birational geometry, at a deeper level than is usual in their undergraduate or graduate studies. Both conferences will provide ample opportunities for students and researchers at all levels to develop productive professional relationships.\r\n\r\nIn more detail regarding the summer 2023 conference on Hyperbolicity and Rationality, one fundamental motivating question in birational geometry is to understand how positivity or negativity of the canonical bundle impacts the geometry, arithmetic and analysis of varieties. Varieties with very negative canonical bundle are expected to \"look like\" projective space and varieties with very positive canonical bundle are expected to look very different from projective space. The conference will bring together experts who study both sides of the question: researchers who study how Fano varieties look like (and unlike) projective space, and researchers who study ways that varieties of general type look very different from projective space. More information about the 2023 thematic program is available on the program website: https://sites.nd.edu/2023cmndthematicprogram/. More details about the 2024 conference will be available from the Center for Mathematics at Notre Dame website: https://centerformath.nd.edu/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
