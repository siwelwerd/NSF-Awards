 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the dawn of our existence, people have gazed at the heavens and the stories of the stars have captured our imagination and inspired humans across the globe. Throughout history astronomy has also bridged communities, countries, and cultures. Various research projects, and anecdotal evidence among educators have shown that topics related to space and its big questions still have the potential to engage people across cultural and political borders. The Earth-sky connection has been a fundamental element in the development of both science and culture, and observations of the sky have helped to define culture, religion, agriculture, spiritual and even temporal points of view, as well as establish calendars, units of measure, travel time, orientation, among many other elements of modern life. \r\n\r\nToday, astronomy remains an important part of our societal fabric. Numerous organizations and networks around the world work to explore and develop research and resources for the benefit of society. Astronomy is a connecting science that brings people together. Through the practice of science for diplomacy, astronomy and space sciences help to maintain open lines of communication between nations through collaboration; improving overall national security for all. In addition, astronomy is often referred to as a gateway science that inspires young and diverse learners here in the U.S. and abroad to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and can result a STEM-literate workforce that improves national prosperity and well-being. \r\n\r\nThe Global Network for Accelerating Synergies Through Research on Astronomy in Culture, Communication, Education and Learning (ASTRO ACCEL) will build an international network of networks (NoN) to accelerate research, resource development, and resource sharing focused on culture, communications, education/learning, and public engagement in astronomy. The result will be a global NoN that advances our knowledge and understanding in these areas for mutual benefit across the NoN. Further, in alignment with the NSF\u2019s programs, Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier, INCLUDES and Growing Convergence Research, ASTRO ACCEL will build upon existing networks to efficiently find creative solutions to complicated problems, and will bridge global communities of researchers and practitioners to accelerate research, improve practice, and further socioeconomic development, thus identifying new areas for convergence research and increasing the number of children worldwide with the resources and science capital required to pursue a career in STEM.\r\n\r\nASTRO ACCEL will use a structural folding and multimodal approach to bring together stakeholders from around the world to build the human capital and identify the cyber infrastructure necessary to support an international NoN of individuals and institutions, accelerate research in the key areas of astronomy education, engagement, culture, and communication, and accelerate the process of research-to-practice in these key areas. In accomplishing its goals, ASTRO ACCEL initially brings together ten well-established U.S. and international networks to focus research and resource sharing in three broad areas including a) formal astronomy education, b) informal astronomy education and astronomy communication, and c) use of astronomy for economic and social development. Throughout the three-year project additional organizations and networks will join the effort. By project end, it is anticipated that approximately 20 networks from across the globe and 300+ individuals will be actively engaged through ASTRO ACCEL.\r\n\r\nResearch on NoN development and sustainable practices will also take place. ASTRO-ACCEL will include a variety of in-person and virtual meetings, as well as other activities. Through a series of surveys and focus group interviews, ASTRO-ACCEL will explore participant experiences and best practices necessary in the creation of sustainable and robust NoNs. Data from the surveys and interviews will help project leadership evolve the implementation of practices and structures that facilitate long-term engagement of networks as well as individuals. Findings and best practices will be shared with the broader STEM enterprise through publications and professional conference presentations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
