 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems\u2019 natural language processing capabilities have made remarkable strides in recent years. Beyond their numerous commercial applications, these advances suggest that AI systems might be powerful tools for deepening our understanding of how humans comprehend natural language. A major obstacle to using them for this purpose is that, while they seem to simulate certain aspects of reasoning by analogy quite well, their capacity to simulate complex logical reasoning shows much room for improvement. This project develops a framework for integrating complex logical reasoning capabilities into the components of AI systems that make their ability to reason by analogy possible. To support the development of this framework, the project builds a large dataset capturing the logical relationships among sentences in three languages by using AI systems to determine which kinds of logical relationships are most useful for improving that system\u2019s own logical reasoning capabilities. Through integration with graduate and undergraduate curricula, the project serves as a vehicle to enhance programming and statistical literacy as well as data collection and data management skills through training with hands-on applications. \r\n\r\nThe framework integrates logical representations into AI systems by imposing constraints on the sorts of numeric representations that those systems use to make inferences on the basis of some natural language input. These constraints are defined in terms of a mapping from the system\u2019s numeric representations of natural language to logical representations. This mapping is learned from scratch and itself constrained (a) to correctly predict inferences that actual speakers of a language make \u2013 as captured by the large-scale datasets collected under the project \u2013 and (b) to be compositional: the meaning of some piece of language must be predictable from the meanings of its parts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
