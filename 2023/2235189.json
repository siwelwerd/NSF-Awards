 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commerical impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide an alternative to hormone replacement therapy for women going through menopause. The technical design and integration are unique in that the end product will operate in the form of hydro-activated, fashion jewelry. This product offers a discreet, stylish, and efficient solution for mitigating vasomotor symptoms, allowing women to remain comfortable as they go through menopause without having to resort to medications with unpleasant side effects. Additionally, the technology has the potential to positively impact the well-being of adjacent groups who suffer from other conditions that lead to overheating. The research and development of this product will increase access to health and wellness options for patients adversely affected by health challenges around the globe.\r\n \r\nThe proposed project seeks to advance the knowledge and understanding of evaporative cooling for use in wearable tech applications. The primary purpose of this research is to provide external cooling relief, via a passive-tech fashion accessory, to individuals experiencing vasomotor symptoms or overheating in general. The goals of the project include improving the efficacy and timing of cooling, while overcoming perception challenges that can vary by individual user experiences. Furthermore, new materials will be explored to further enhance the cooling sensation with testing and optimization being a consistent factor. Finally, customer feedback will be gathered regarding product efficacy and marketability. Upon completion, this research will provide a greater understanding of how to optimize and refine the evaporative cooling technology for wearable tech applications, leading to improved consumer satisfaction. Knowledge and understanding of evaporative cooling for use outside of the typical, large-scale industrial and residential home applications will be advanced and utilized for the proposed application.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
