 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interplay between algebra and geometry is one of the classical\r\nthemes in mathematics. Traditionally, one studies geometric objects\r\nvia their symmetries. In geometric group theory the situation is\r\nreversed: one starts with a group of symmetries of an algebraic object\r\n(for example, another group) and constructs a geometric object with\r\nthe same symmetries. Here the focus is on the study of symmetries of\r\nsurfaces. Surprisingly, its geometry is to a large degree governed by\r\nhyperbolic geometry that goes back to Gauss, Lobacevski, Poincare and\r\nothers. The goal is to better understand this phenomenon. The\r\nproposer's PhD students and postdoctoral researchers are also\r\ninvolved in parts of this investigation.\r\n\r\nThe most important result about the dynamics of classical mapping\r\nclasses is the Nielsen-Thurston classification, which explains the\r\nbehavior of iterates of simple closed curves. The same goal in the\r\ncase of surfaces of infinite type looks to be much harder, but\r\ncertainly worthy of a systematic study. The family of groups of proper\r\nhomotopy equivalences of a locally finite graph is a sister family to\r\nthe family of big mapping class groups, with many similarities and\r\nintriguing differences that the investigator wants to explore. More\r\nclassically, the investigator wants to build ``towers'' of successive\r\napproximations to the classical mapping class group complexes, as well\r\nas complexes associated to automorphism groups of free groups, much\r\nlike the Taylor series. The process of building these towers is called\r\n``disintegration'' and preliminary work shows that it succeeds for the\r\narc and curve complexes and sheds new light on their large-scale\r\ngeometry. This is yet another attempt to establish that the complexes\r\nassociated with automorphism groups of free groups have finite\r\nasymptotic dimension, perhaps the main outstanding open question about\r\nthe large-scale geometry of this group. The questions about ergodic\r\nmeasures could have been asked many years ago, but new methods are\r\nneeded to answer them.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
