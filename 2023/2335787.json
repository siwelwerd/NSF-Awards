 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. Research Data Summit held by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (the National Academies) will convene representatives of approximately 40 key research data organizations across all sectors for a discussion of strategies to: a) increase coherence of interests and activities among the various organizations, b) to increase communication and collaboration, and c) to reduce duplication of effort. The summit will also explore how participating organizations can work together to position the United States to be appropriately represented in and benefit from international discussions on research data. The summit planning committee will bring together a diverse group of invitees and will include individuals from research institutions, industry, U.S. federal agencies, scholarly societies, disciplinary and basic and applied data science professional societies and those that nucleate underserved populations, research libraries, higher education associations, and U.S.-based project funders. The summit will be held October 10-11, 2023 in Washington, DC.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
