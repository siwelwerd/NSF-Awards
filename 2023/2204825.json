 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the development of a lightweight, ultra-compact 3D sensor offering enhanced performance compared to the current state-of-the-art. Existing sensors on consumer electronic devices, such as those on augmented/virtual reality headsets, are limited in their perception accuracy and detection range resulting in a poor user experience, which has limited their implementation. The technology developed in this project seeks to address these issues to create a truly seamless and immersive interaction experience for users. The technology may also improve the adoption of augmented/virtual reality technologies in fields such as education, telecommuting, healthcare, industrial design, virtual meetings, entertainment, and many others. The technology has the potential to create new jobs in these fields, enhance human-to-machine interactions, and improve connections within and between communities. This effort also supports domestic photonics manufacturing and assembly industries.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project will seeks to develop a novel 3D sensor design that promises performance enhancement over state-of-the-art devices. Building on a proprietary flat optics technology, the project may lead to a 3D sensor module featuring panoramic vision, significant spatial resolution improvements, enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, and a compact, lightweight architecture amenable to low-cost manufacturing and assembly. The project has two main goals: 1) demonstration of a 3D sensor prototype and experimental validation of its performance and 2) development of scalable manufacturing routes for fabrication of flat optics components leveraging standard microfabrication technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
