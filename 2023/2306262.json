 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving understanding of the social, cultural, educational, and institutional parameters affecting matriculation of Latina engineering students into graduate engineering programs.  The work will improve understanding of the complex psycho-social processes contributing to the persistent underrepresentation of Latinx and Hispanic students across STEM fields and the existence of a gender gap that is larger than found in the general population. Latinx and Hispanic students in STEM come from the fastest growing ethnic minority in the United States. However, they are extremely underrepresented in terms of STEM degrees, especially at the graduate level. This research helps correct this situation, by providing critically needed insights to draw more Latina students into STEM graduate programs and eventually into the professorial ranks.\r\n\r\nThis project will improve understanding of the complex factors affecting the career decisions of Latina engineering students and their likelihood to enter graduate engineering study.  Two research questions are posed: RQ1: How do Latina engineering students describe the factors related to their decision, decision processes, or intentions to enter graduate school and/or engineering career pathways? RQ2: How do Latina engineering students describe the social, cultural, educational, and institutional experiences that impact their decision, decision process, or intentions to enter graduate school and/or engineering career pathways? An explanatory sequential mixed methods approach will be employed.  Phase 1 is quantitative with an emphasis on institutional integration using the modified Collegiate Achievement Model.  Results from phase 1 are used to inform the qualitative phase 2 which shifts the theoretical framework to the Community Cultural Wealth Model to center the complexities and assets of the participants\u2019 lived experiences.  This is done specifically to provide broader, richer insights into both the institutional integration issues and the cultural and social perspectives behind the factors and experiences impacting Latina engineering student graduate study and career pathway decisions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
