 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant breeding plays a vital role in addressing the three priorities for U.S. agriculture: 1) plant health and production and plant products; 2) food safety, nutrition, and health; and 3) bioenergy, natural resources, and the environment. The development of improved plant breeding practices will be crucial in overcoming the challenges faced by agriculture in the next decade. Climate variability and the need for secure, sustainable, and nutritious food supplies are among the key issues that must be addressed. Each year, the National Association of Plant Breeders (NAPB) holds an annual conference that highlights cutting edge interdisciplinary research and the methodologies and technologies applied by today's plant breeders. In addition, the meeting provides opportunities for training young scientists on the latest methods of developing improved plants for sustainable production and provides a platform for participants to network and develop productive collaborations to ensure discoveries are translated into commercially relevant products.  NSF funds will be used to provide travel awards to students, postdoctoral associates and early career investigators, especially those from underrepresented groups in STEM, to participate in the annual NAPB conference to be held July 16-18, 2023, in Greenville (SC). \r\n\r\nBy participating in the annual NAPB conference, students, postdoctoral associates and/or early career investigators will have the opportunity to 1) present their research findings and receive feedback from their peers; 2) network with established plant breeders and professionals in the field; 3) learn about cutting-edge research in the field and contribute to advancing the discipline; 4) foster collaborations and partnerships with individuals from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives; and, 5) gain exposure to public- and private-sector priorities and needs. By creating a more inclusive and diverse conference, the plant breeding community will benefit from a wider range of perspectives, experiences, and ideas to enable more innovative research, better problem-solving, and improved plant breeding practices. Ultimately, this will lead to more sustainable food production and better agricultural practices for communities around the world.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
