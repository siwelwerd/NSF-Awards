 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a residential solar power generation technology that could provide a significant improvement to the United States and world goals to reduce carbon emissions. This project combines several breakthrough technology developments to make solar-generated electricity practical for the consumer, installer, and the power company.  The breakthroughs are not in photovoltaic (PV) efficiency, but instead, focus on technology that significantly increases dependability (reliability, accessibility, and maintainability); makes installations easier; and makes residential solar energy suitable for large-scale power generation for utility companies. The target customers are regional companies that sell and install solar energy systems on residential rooftops. These companies are sensitive to the reliability (warranty), affordability, performance, and safety of the equipment that they install. There are about 1,000 solar power installation companies in the US, and they are outfitting homes at the combined rate of almost one per minute. The solar energy market is currently valued at $17 billion dollars annually and is expected to double in size in the next 5 years.\r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop an innovative architecture that consists of modular PV panels, unique non-flammable battery packs, patent-pending high efficiency converters, and a sophisticated interface to utility grids. There are no power combiners, external charging systems, communications boxes, current transformers, load switches, sub-panels, inverter boxes, power optimizers, or bulky battery packs involved. The product provides a much-needed breakthrough for the utility industry as it enables residential solar power generation to be a suitable power source for large-scale connection to existing power grids.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
