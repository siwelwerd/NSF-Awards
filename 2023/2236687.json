 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 2013 the NSF Division of Ocean Sciences (NSF-OCE) asked the National Academy of Sciences to develop a decadal survey and with that, a list of the top ocean science priorities for the next decade in the context of the current state of knowledge, ongoing research activities, and resource availability. As a result, in 2015 the committee for the Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences 2015 (DSOS) produced a report and the National Academy of Sciences published \u201cSea Change: Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences 2015-2025\u201d. The report identified eight ocean science research priorities and made recommendations to advise NSF on strategies to reach a balance of investments to achieve those research priorities. This report has been used by NSF and the Ocean Sciences Community to plan the way forward. As the end of the decade (2015-2025) nears, there have been changes in the portfolio of research and facilities supported by NSF-OCE. Future investments in ships and observing platforms will require careful consideration of the research facilities to support the main areas of ocean science funded by NSF.\r\n\r\nThis award provides funding for the 2025-2035 Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences for the National Science Foundation The last decadal survey prepared for the National Science Foundation (NSF) by the National Academies was published in 2015: Sea Change: Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences 2015-2025. Since Sea Change was published, there have been changes in the portfolio of research and facilities supported by the NSF Division of Ocean Sciences (NSF-OCE). Future investments in ships and observing platforms will require careful consideration of the research facilities to support the main areas of ocean science funded by the NSF. Investment in workforce training and support to address the new research priorities will also be needed, such as building interdisciplinary teams and strategies for using scientific information to help address societal challenges. The Decadal Survey will advise the NSF-OCE on forward-looking approaches to guide investments in research, infrastructure, and workforce development. The committee will develop a compelling research and infrastructure strategy to advance understanding of the ocean's role in the Earth system and the sustainable blue economy. The report will recommend ways that NSF-OCE could develop the capacity to respond nimbly as priorities change and new opportunities emerge over the 2025-2035 decade.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
