 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a series of conferences that will bring economists and other social scientists from around the country together at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Business in Lincoln, Nebraska. The conference, which will be named the Nebraska Labor Summit, will provide a space for economists and other social scientists to gather, discuss their ongoing research, and build new collaborative relationships. The conference will focus on labor economics and closely related fields. The conference objectives are to: 1) foster the exchange of ideas and provide an opportunity for economics from around the Midwest, including from nearby emerging research institutions, to form new relationships that could expand the scope and quality of their ongoing and future work; and 2) expose undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and nearby institutions to frontier research, networking opportunities, and a chance to discuss their work with top researchers. The conference also has strong potential to benefit the broader community because the field of labor is increasingly focused on using causal methods to answer questions of pressing interest to individuals, firms, and policymakers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
