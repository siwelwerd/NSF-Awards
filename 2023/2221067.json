 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Seton Hill University, a 4-year liberal arts school located in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Over its 6-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 15 unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor\u2019s degrees in Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, and Forensic Science. First-year students will receive up to four-years of scholarship support. The project aims to recruit students from economically-disadvantaged and historically underrepresented backgrounds from Pittsburgh area high schools during an outreach event. Once scholars are recruited, the project will use a combination of group-based and one-on-one mentorship activities along with a social media connection. Supplemental instruction with a peer mentor will be incorporated in an organic chemistry course that is known to be a barrier for students in these majors. A career exploration and opportunities seminar will increase awareness about research and internship opportunities and about possible career pathways. Participants will develop an individual development plan (IDP) which includes an assessment of each scholar\u2019s unique skills, their short- and long-term goals, and action steps to achieve those goals. The proposed project activities will benefit society by increasing the number of STEM students from historically underrepresented populations and generating knowledge about how the combination of mentorship strategies, including a social media connection, support retention and graduation of this student population.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Three specific aims of the project are to: (1) increase the percentage of students from underrepresented backgrounds majoring in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, and forensic science; (2) retain students by increasing the scholars\u2019 sense of belonging in their major using an innovative mentorship model and providing peer tutoring for organic chemistry; and (3) increase the graduation rate of biology, chemistry, biochemistry, and forensic science majors to support the growing regional STEM workforce. The proposed project will be assessed to better understand what strategies impact the recruitment, retention, and academic success of high-achieving, economically disadvantaged STEM majors. In particular, evaluation will focus on the effectiveness of a single-day outreach and recruitment activity, the novel mentorship and social media model, and peer-led team learning in organic chemistry. The project also aims to generate knowledge about the success of a career-focused seminar series and goal-orientated IDP for increasing graduation rates and preparedness for the STEM workforce. Results of the project will be presented at national conferences and local workshops to build upon the already existing research on impactful STEM education practices. This project is funded by NSF\u2019s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
