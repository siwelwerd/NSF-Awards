 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a microfluidic sensor system has the potential to significantly impact public health efforts to control the spread of viruses. It can be used for rapid and reliable detection of viruses, including COVID-19, in home and point-of-care settings, enabling early diagnosis and treatment of infected individuals. This can help reduce the transmission of the virus and mitigate the overall impact of the pandemic. Successful commercialization of the technology will lead to significant market potential in disease surveillance and biomedical research. Ultimately, the project aims to play a critical role in mitigating the impact \r\nof COVID-19 and improving access to essential testing solutions for people worldwide. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a microfluidic system for detecting COVID-19. The gold electrode-covered microfluidic system is immobilized with DNA nanocages installed with aptamers or surface enzymes on the electrode surface that generates varying electrical impedance signals depending on the number of virus particles in a saliva sample injected into the system. The DNA origami nanocage technique, together with\r\naptamer/ACE2 enzymes are able to specifically capture the intact SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The immobilization of the DNA nanocage installed with aptamer/enzyme in a microfluidic system allows for easy, fast, and sensitive detection. The electrical impedance measurement provides an accurate label-free means of detecting the presence of the virus at nano-molar levels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
