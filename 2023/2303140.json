 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RAPID project involves a seismic deployment of 86 Smartsolo 5Hz nodes to the epicenter region of the ongoing Elgin-Lugoff earthquake swarm sequence in South Carolina. This sequence started with a magnitude (M) 3.3 on December 27, 2021, in a region with relatively low background seismicity. This sequence appears to occur in several episodes, sometimes initiated by M 3+ events, and has up to months of gaps in between. While they occurred along the ancient Eastern Piedmont Fault System, a close examination of the earthquakes reveals that most of the events occurred in between the fault system. At this point, it is still not clear what is the driving force for this earthquake swarm and how long it will last.\r\n\r\nThis deployment is timely, because this sequence is still ongoing, with no signs of ending soon. In addition, only one station was deployed within a few kilometers of the swarm. Such station distribution is not sufficient enough to provide a detailed high-resolution detection/relocation of microseismicity during an earthquake swarm, which are needed for better deciphering the spatio-temporal evolutions of the swarm sequence and their physical mechanisms. In addition, the seismic data collected in this deployment will be used to construct a velocity model of the local subsurface structure. Accurate seismic models are crucial particularly for developing ground motion models for seismic hazard assessment and delineating fault\r\nlocations. Up to 15 undergraduate/graduate students from both Georgia Tech and University of South Carolina will be involved in the nodal deployment. Data will be made available through the IRIS Data Management Center.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This area has historically exhibited low seismicity, yet by April 2024, it has experienced 97 small earthquakes listed in the United States Geological Survey (USGS) catalog. This sequence presented a unique opportunity to investigate the dynamics of earthquake swarms in stable continental regions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Research Activities and Methods:</strong> To better understand this swarm, we deployed 86 Smartsolo 5-Hz 3-component seismic nodes in the direct vicinity of the Elgin swarm from October 2022 for a duration of four months (Figure 1). Additional 20+ nodes were redeployed in Fall 2023 to record additional swarms in that region. We utilized a combination of deep learning and match filter techniques for event detection and applied the double-difference relocation method to refine earthquake locations. We also used Velest to develop a 1D seismic velocity model in this region.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>\r\n<p><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Our high-resolution earthquake catalog identified up to 100 microearthquake locations during the deployment period, compared to only 4 events listed in the USGS catalog for the same timeframe.</p>\r\n<p><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The improved catalog revealed significantly smaller magnitudes, with local magnitudes ranging from -2.17 to 2.54, achieving a magnitude of completeness at -0.20 (Figure 1c).</p>\r\n<p><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The relocated seismicity delineates a single fault plane striking nearly north-south and dipping westward (Figure 2). This orientation is inconsistent with known fault structures and regional magnetic anomalies.</p>\r\n<p><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Focal mechanism solutions for selected events indicate primarily strike-slip faulting, with nodal planes aligning with the north-south seismic cluster.</p>\r\n<p><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Our new 1D velocity model for the region indicates a thin sedimentary layer and a nominal Moho depth. However, layering between the surface and Moho is unusual with several thin layers with small velocity jumps.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The findings from this study provide valuable insights into intraplate earthquake swarm dynamics in a stable continental region. The high-resolution relocated catalog serves as a benchmark dataset for future studies on the swarm sequence and may aid in assessing seismic hazard in the region. Furthermore, the methodologies developed in this project&mdash;particularly the application of deep learning for event detection&mdash;contribute to advancing seismic monitoring techniques in low-seismicity regions. This project involved dozens of undergraduate and graduate students from GT and UofSC in the field work, and subsequent analysis of the seismic data. Several nodes were deployed in local middle and high schools, and PI Frost has visited them multiple times for education and outreach purposes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This project successfully enhanced our understanding of the Elgin earthquake swarm and provided critical data for future research. The new insights gained from precise earthquake relocations, magnitude assessments, and focal mechanism solutions offer a foundation for further studies into the underlying geophysical mechanisms driving swarm activity in stable continental settings.</p>\r\n<p>Figure 1.
