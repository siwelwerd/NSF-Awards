 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds for PhD students and post-doctoral researchers to attend the 16th Tri-Annual International Conference on Stochastic Programming (ICSP), in Davis, California, 24-28 July 2023. The ICSP is the premier event of the Stochastic Programming Society, a technical session of the Mathematical Optimization Society that brings together researchers, students, and practitioners who work on decision-making under uncertainty. Funded participants are expected to engage in research at the intersection of data and decision analytics, machine learning, and operations research, with applications to autonomous systems, climate adaptation, and cyber-physical systems. \r\n\r\nThe emphasis on new challenges brought by emerging technologies requires novel ways of conceptualizing and modeling decision processes in coupled systems. Multiple sources of uncertainty become common when using optimization models to plan for responses to natural disasters. New research directions and ideas are expected to converge among the conference participants. This project reduces financial barriers for underrepresented groups to attend the conference and thus makes STEM fields more diverse and inclusive. The conference also provides a networking opportunity for researchers in industry and academic institutions of the US and other countries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
