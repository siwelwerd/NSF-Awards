 "awd_abstract_narration": "The southeastern US is a hotspot of biological diversity and hosts some of the more unique coastal ecosystems in North America. The natural resources of the southeast region also face increased threats from a fast-growing population and abrupt changes in climate. The Mentoring and Research Opportunities for Careers in Coastal Science (MROC2S) program will study how organisms and ecosystems respond to changes in climate conditions that are expected to result in community shifts and impacts to ecosystem services in this region. The MROC2S program brings together a network of scientists, educators, and experts from various sectors to provide training for participants from groups traditionally underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) and those with limited research experience in a cohort setting, with the intent of developing the next generation of natural resource professionals.\r\n  \r\nThe main goal of the program is to provide year-round mentoring, professional development, and diverse research training opportunities in natural resource science for postbaccalaureate participants. By doing so, MROC2S aims to develop a strong and inclusive research and technical skills program that produces a more diverse STEM workforce. Program participants are integrated into a broad network of natural resource professionals in the Atlantic Coastal Plain and Gulf Coast regions, with the goal of exposing them to careers and opportunities in this field. Network partners contribute to a common scientific theme that centers on the restoration, conservation, and management of natural resources of the southeastern US. As participants, program fellows contribute to the rich history of collaborative work and long-term data collection that helps guide and inform research efforts in this ecologically resource-rich and diverse region of the US. Using long-term data from core sites coupled with skill training and mentoring resources to guide the research, the collaborative network will lead to professional development of participants, enabling them to pursue careers in coastal and natural resource science. Furthermore, the activities and experiences provided by the program are guided by a theoretical framework that leads to scientific integration and a sense of belonging to the scientific community among participants. This framework incorporates critical environmental agency to further develop participants\u2019 science self-efficacy, identity, and sense of belonging.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
