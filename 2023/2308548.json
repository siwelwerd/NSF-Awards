 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interaction between water and minerals is a fundamental process that shapes and records memories of landscapes, generates water quality and nutrients to sustain ecosystems, and draws down atmospheric CO2 over longer timescales. In watersheds, water is fed into the landscape through rain and snow where it starts its journey along various paths in the subsurface. Along the path, water encounters and exchanges with minerals, incorporating chemicals liberated from the solids and transforming them into other forms in a process termed weathering. Eventually the water with its unique chemical signature is flushed from the system into nearby streams and groundwater springs. The conventional wisdom is that the longer water spends in contact with the surrounding subsurface, the more chemically evolved it becomes. Under this framework, the amount of weathering observed in a catchment should be inextricably linked with groundwater ages. Historically, this relationship has been difficult to fully evaluate. This project will use modern geochemical tools in tandem with advanced modeling approaches to advance our understanding of the relationship between groundwater ages and weathering fluxes in a montane catchment, Sagehen Creek Basin, located in the Central Sierra Nevada mountains in California. This collaborative research effort will support two early career scientists, one PhD student, a field technician, and provide opportunities for undergraduate research. Researchers will collaborate with established Earth Science educators to launch a suite of educational products and initiatives to engage the broader public, high school students and instructors on hydrology and water quality themes. \r\n\r\nThis research aims to better characterize the relationship between groundwater ages and silicate weathering rates at the catchment-scale through a combined hydrologic and geochemical approach. Silicate weathering reactions are uniquely coupled to catchment hydrology due to slow reaction kinetics; thus, solute generation is inherently dependent on the time fluids spend exposed to minerals. The project will develop and leverage a new, comprehensive water age (CFC, SF6, and 35S) and weathering (\u03b430Si, \u03b444Ca, and Ge/Si) tracer dataset to inform a coupled 2D physical transport hydrologic and isotope-enabled, multicomponent reactive transport model. The study will be conducted at Sagehen Creek Basin, a snowmelt driven, igneous, montane watershed sensitive to climatic. Sagehen is a widely studied site with several prior studies demonstrating a correlation between measured weathering-derived solute fluxes and groundwater residence times. This hybrid hydrological and geochemical approach will provide unprecedented insight into the synergistic relationship between fluid transit time and silicate weathering. The researchers plan to generate dynamic, continually evolving transit time distributions for water in response to both seasonal and event forcing, and through the incorporation of \u201cfast\u201d/shallow and \u201cslow\u201d/deeper groundwater components. This research further provides an opportunity to evaluate the utility of stable isotopes and trace element tracers that are sensitive to distinct reaction pathways, and to quantify how the extent of reactions can serve as \u201creaction clocks\u201d. Findings will provide insight into persistent questions in critical zone science related to watershed hydrogeochemical response to climate change. \r\n\r\nThis research is co-funded by the Division of Earth Sciences Geobiology and Low-Temperature Geochemistry Program and Hydrologic Sciences Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
