 "awd_abstract_narration": "The integration of both classical and quantum photonic integrated circuits (PICs) is poised to revolutionize information communications technology, computing, and sensing systems. These advances are made possible through novel manufacturing processes that integrate heterogeneous materials onto integrated circuits to introduce light generation, information encoding, and signal transmission and transduction. These functions are necessary to achieve large information capacity that deliver unprecedented data transfer speeds within data centers and packaged semiconductor integrated circuits. STAMPEDE has assembled a team of experts in materials, photonics, manufacturing, and education to rapidly advance research and skilled STEM workforce training pertaining to this emerging generation of integrated photonic systems. It will provide low-cost scalable nanomanufacturing solutions, photonic chip designs for high-density information with anti-counterfeiting features and embedded hardware security against cyber physical attacks. Concomitantly, this project will enhance education and access to state-of-the-art photonics science and technology for broad audiences including community colleges, undergraduate and graduate students with a strong emphasis in material processing, semiconductor manufacturing and sustainable technologies. These advances are expected to benefit consumers of electronic products with an efficient photonic integrated platform that will provide fast, reliable and energy-efficient computing and communications, and, at the same time, provide an educational and workforce pipeline for the US-industry to lead the forefront of the global semiconductor industry. \r\n\r\nSTAMPEDE will demonstrate (i) III-V semiconductor heterogeneous integration onto silicon via selective-area growth method of III-V nanowire array light-emitting diodes and its micro-transfer printing onto silicon substrates, (ii) scalable 3D nanopatterning of infrared optical microscale elements via electrochemical nanoimprinting that improve light coupling efficiency, (iii) hardware systems for handling information dense tasks secured with physical unclonable functions (PUFs) that can prevent cyberattacks, and (iv) machine learning models to enable inverse design of PUFs in waveguide structures, while allowing scalable process integration with standard foundry manufacturing. STAMPEDE\u2019s educational and workforce development plan include: (1) strengthening undergraduate and graduate education through new photonics program offerings, bootcamps, course innovations, and cross-institutional learning, (2) workforce advancement through the development of massive open online courses and virtual learning opportunities, and (3) growth of face-to-face photonics bootcamps and establishment of an annual STAMPEDE workshop organized in conjunction with the Electronic Materials Conference. In close collaboration with partner minority serving institution (i.e., Bridgewater State University) and community colleges (i.e., Cape Cod Community College, Massasoit Community College, Monroe Community College), STAMPEDE seeks to advance opportunities for underrepresented groups in pursuing graduate education, enhance STEM career training, and increase exposure to semiconductor manufacturing concepts at the undergraduate level.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
