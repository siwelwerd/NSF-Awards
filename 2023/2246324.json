 "awd_abstract_narration": "Boise State University\u2019s Raptor Research Center (RRC) and Intermountain Bird Observatory (IBO) constitute part of a globally recognized hub of raptor research located in Boise, Idaho. Boise is also home to the nation\u2019s only MS graduate program in Raptor Biology. Our IRES project leverages this expertise with that of a globally recognized international partner, Foundacion Migres, located in Tarifa, Spain, to collaborate on transformative research focused on potential effects of a changing climate, oceanographic conditions, wind dynamics, and renewable energy on migratory raptors. The Migres research campus is uniquely located in the world\u2019s most important flyway for raptors, on the Iberian Peninsula between Europe and Africa at the strait of Gibraltar. This is an important area for renewable (wind and solar) energy development and research, and focus is on intercontinental connections of migrating birds and resolving conflicts between wildlife and renewable energy. Our IRES program leverages the RRC, IBO and Migres partnership to deliver 8-week, international student research experiences for U.S. graduate and undergraduate students, engage students in structured professional development and scientific communication, and allow students to gain an understanding of a multicultural research environment abroad to help prepare them for the global workforce. \r\n\r\nOur collaborative international research focuses on effects of weather, wind, oceanographic conditions and wind/solar energy development on migration and population dynamics of birds of prey. Weather and wind conditions, influenced by changing climate and oceanographic conditions, may significantly affect a bird\u2019s decision to initiate migration, the course and pace of migration, and survival during migration. These factors especially affect large raptors and other soaring birds. We focus on migrating raptors crossing the Strait of Gibraltar during migration and range expansion of African raptor species in a region that connects birds from the European and African continents. Because of a changing climate and increased need for energy production, there is need for mitigating conflicts arising among anthropogenic and biological factors and wildlife.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
