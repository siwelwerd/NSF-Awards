 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract:\r\nOur teeth are made of hard tissues, including enamel and dentin. Dentin is the part under the outer layer of enamel and is responsible for the mechanical strength of teeth. Dentin is mostly composed of a compound called hydroxyapatite, which consists of calcium, phosphate, and hydroxide ions. Under specific conditions, the calcium ions in hydroxyapatite can be substituted by other ions of similar size. These substitutions may impact hydroxyapatite's mechanical and structural properties and, consequently, dentin. While similar studies have been conducted on materials like enamel and bones, this research focuses on dentin, which has yet to receive much attention thus far. The goal of this study is to study how dentinal hydroxyapatite behaves in the presence of different ionic solutions and if they improve its properties. Methods exploring various structural and mechanical properties of hydroxyapatite will be employed in this study. \r\nIn conjunction with their research efforts, the principal investigator proposes an educational initiative that involves developing a curriculum on dental materials for undergraduate students and organizing workshops and seminars for high school students. This foundational study can have far-reaching broader impacts, as it can eventually lead to new interventions that improve the strength of dentin, especially as hard tissues may be compromised due to diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nThis research project aims to investigate the influence of inorganic trace minerals (IoTM) on the structure and mechanical properties of dentinal hydroxyapatite (HAp) while engaging in multiple education and outreach activities for students at various education levels. The proposed project aims to investigate the influence of IoTM, specifically Mn, Cu, and Li, on dentin's structure and mechanical properties, a vital component of teeth. By employing a multidisciplinary approach, combining materials science, biology, and biochemistry, the team seeks to expand the understanding of how trace minerals impact dentin's material properties. The research objectives of this study are to answer the following questions: (1) How does IoTM (as measured in the dentin, either occurring naturally or through extrinsic/intrinsic exposure) affect dentin structure and, in turn, its mechanical properties? (2) What structural properties drive the mechanical changes, and how do these changes vary according to IoTM type (Mn, Cu, or Li) and exposure duration? These objectives will be accomplished via advanced imaging and spectroscopy techniques using X-Ray diffractometry, short/wide angle X-Ray scattering, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and scanning electron microscope to study the IoTM substitution in HAp, crystal properties, and lattice properties. The mechanical properties, including the plastic parameters and solubility, will also be tested to determine the IoTM exposure using human models. In addition to the scientific research, this project incorporates important educational goals. It seeks to promote interdisciplinary studies in dental material science, foster interest in STEM fields among undergraduate students, and provide opportunities for underrepresented minorities and women in STEM. The outcomes of this research can facilitate the development of improved technologies and biomaterials, leading to enhanced dental treatments for individuals with conditions impacting trace mineral regulation. Simultaneously, it will contribute to scientific knowledge in the field of mineralized tissues and promote STEM education initiatives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
