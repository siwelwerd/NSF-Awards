 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact and commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an innovative technology designed to improve the safety and security of autonomous vehicles and robots, automation systems, and smart devices. It is built on the development of autonomous motion planning and control algorithms inspired by human drivers to perform aggressive vehicle maneuvers for high-agility, unstable fast vehicle motions. The platform can analyze combined safety and security risk surfaces for these connected cyber-physical systems, providing an enabling tool to determine the maximum operational domain and functional limits of autonomous or intelligent systems. The technology development also allows for simulation testbeds for these systems and devices to test their interconnection security, mimicking real-world scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a platform which has direct applications in the connected cyber-physical systems market. Autonomous vehicles, robotics, and smart devices are widely used in various industries, and the demand for safety and security certifications for these systems is increasing rapidly. This technology provides an innovative tool to analyze the combined safety and security risk surfaces for these systems, making it possible to design human-inspired active safety features for next-generation \"accident-free\" vehicles or robots. The technology can also extend to various other fields that require safety and security risk assessments. This project has the potential to enrich STEM education in emerging technologies such as robotics, machine learning, and smart devices, and to support the national welfare and prosperity by advancing the safety and security of autonomous systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
