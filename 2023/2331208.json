 "awd_abstract_narration": "Boise State University\u2019s vision for this Accelerating Research Translation (ART) project is to create and maintain a thriving, sustainable, and innovative translational research ecosystem that is responsive to the economic and societal needs of the region and nation. To do so, the project team will capitalize on emerging momentum in two tracks that are poised for growth and investment: market-oriented (Track 1) and community-engaged (Track 2) translational research. The market-oriented track will address commercialization and traditional technology transfer work that identifies innovations in the laboratory and moves them efficiently to the marketplace (e.g., problem identification, innovation, intellectual property protection, industry collaboration, and translation through licensing or startups). The community-engaged track addresses innovations in human systems, healthy ecosystems, public policymaking, and democratic governance. This track is designed to better equip federal, state, local, tribal governments as well as NGOs, nonprofits and community organizations with the tools and networks to manage and respond to socio-economic changes resulting from stressors, such as, a rapidly increasing population, greater pressures on natural resources, and changing climate conditions. During the first year of the project, seven ART Ambassadors will champion program development, policy reform, and the reallocation of resources to support translational research. Program mentor, Arizona State University\u2019s Global Center for Tech Transfer team, will work with Boise State to advise on strategic areas of investment, identify hindrances and roadblocks to a successful translational research process, and serve as a resource for training and institutional capacity building. In building, testing, and advancing translational research systems, the ART Ambassadors will invest in Seed Translational Research Projects based on translational potential, responsiveness to priority societal problems, strong partnerships, and training opportunities for postdocs and graduate students.\r\n\r\nBoise State\u2019s ART project represents a deliberate effort to improve the university\u2019s connections and role within the regional entrepreneurial ecosystem. The project team will consolidate a set of institutional initiatives to foster the growth of this entrepreneurial ecosystem, integrating university and industry leadership, mobilizing faculty expertise to support dialogue and evidence-based decision making, and creating a robust network of partners. By strengthening its institutional capacity in translational research, Boise State will be an active partner of new industries that are rapidly expanding in the region and will support government officials and NGOs to design collaborative solutions to pressing social, environmental, and policy problems. The ART project will provide training for early career faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students to help prepare the next generation of translational research professionals. Project leadership and ART Ambassadors will ensure inclusiveness and accessibility in all aspects of the proposed work, including lowering barriers to participation, implementing inclusive mentoring networks, and assessing diversity and inclusiveness in the translational research community on campus and with external partners. By the end of the ART program, Boise State will demonstrate an upward trajectory in the \u201cBig 5\u201d translational research metrics: invention disclosures, new patent applications, total licenses, license revenue, and startups formed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
