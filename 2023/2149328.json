 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds an innovative collaboration between the University of Maryland and Prince George\u2019s Community College. Their partnership will focus on building a research participation pathway for students transferring from community college to a four-year institution. The goal is to attract a wider range of students to consider careers in economics research. UMD already hosts a program designed to involve academically-talented undergraduate economics students in faculty research projects. This program also provides the participating students with mentoring, academic support, and professional development opportunities. The award will extend this program to a community college campus and will also fund additional research experiences for recent graduates who are considering pursuing graduate studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
