 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Union College is acquiring a thermogravimetric analyzer integrated with a Fourier Transform infrared spectrometer and a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (TGA/FTIR/GC/MS) system to support the research of Ellen Robertson, Ann Anderson, Mary Carroll, Yijing Stehle, and Christopher Whitehead and other colleagues at the institution. In general, a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) is a scientific instrument that aids the characterization of the structural, mechanical, chemical, and physical properties of materials as a function of temperature. However, having only information about the material weight loss as a function of temperature is not sufficient for answering the specific research questions associated with each material. Instead, a thorough characterization of the chemical species that are released during material heating is often desired. A TGA/FTIR/GC/MS system allows for the unambiguous identification of material thermal degradation products through the assignment of both vibrational modes (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy \u2013 FTIR) and molecular weight analysis (Mass Spectroscopy \u2013 MS). The instrument impacts many areas, such as chemistry, mechanical engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology. Furthermore, the new instrumen provides research and educational opportunities for a diverse group of at least 50 undergraduate students annually, both inside and outside of the classroom.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. Research enabled by the instrument is focused on characterizing the structural, mechanical, chemical, and physical properties of diverse classes of modern nanomaterials, including plasmonic nanomaterials for detecting pollutants, semiconducting quantum dots for heavy metal sensing, metal oxide nanocrystals and aerogels for catalysis, and functionalized graphene oxide membranes for water filtration and purification. The instrument allows for the unambiguous identification of nanomaterial thermal degradation products through the assignment of both vibrational modes and molecular weight signatures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
