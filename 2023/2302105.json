 "awd_abstract_narration": "On September 16th, 2022, the Yukon-Kuskokwim (YK) Delta of western Alaska was hit by ex-Typhoon Merbok, a storm that many residents of the area described as the worst in their lifetime. The storm surge was several meters in height, and inland locations that normally do not flood under the highest tides of the year were inundated, resulting in extensive loss of homes, fishing boats, and subsistence cabins. This storm was unusual not only because of its size, but also its timing as the ground was not yet frozen or snow-covered. Since the Delta is flat, salty water extended for about a dozen or more miles inland, flooding Alaskan villages, hunting and fishing camps, and landscapes that are not acclimated to frequent floods. In this work, scientists will perform aerial and ground surveys to map the extent of the floods by looking for driftwood and other vegetation left behind by retreating water. Where driftwood is found, scientists will determine the amount of sediment deposited and measure pond salinity to test whether ponds switched from freshwater to salty water during the flood. The researchers will then set-up areas to observe longer-term effects of the floods on plants and the release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. As climate change contributes to larger and more frequent storms like Typhoon Merbok, understanding the consequences of them is becoming increasingly important to better prepare for the impacts of these storms on the landscape and the people who live in their path. \r\n\r\nThis research consists of three components to address the extent and impact of Typhoon Merbok on the YK Delta region. First, researchers will conduct aerial and river surveys of drift lines and salinity along four rivers near Chevak, Alaska. For aerial surveys, transects ca. 30 km long and 2 km apart will be flown in mid-autumn 2022 with two observers photographing drift lines. All photographs will be geolocated. For river surveys, researchers will locate and sample debris, collect soil to quantity sediment deposition, and sample water bodies for salinity. Second, researchers will use high-resolution remotely-sensed imagery to locate fields of larger debris over a greater extent of the YK Delta. The elevation of debris from components one and two will be extracted from available LIDAR and structure-from-motion elevation models to determine the elevation of flood waters. Finally, researchers will establish monitoring plots to test hypotheses about impacts of the flooding, including evaluating changes to plant community composition, CO2 flux due to salt-kill, and CH4 flux due to suppression of methanogenesis by sulfates that occur in sea water. The project will produce valuable maps and data on the impacts of Merbok on the YK Delta Region, which will be made publicly available and be shared directly with local communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This extensive storm caused damage to villages in the region and had the potential to disrupt the landscape because the coast was not yet protected by sea ice. In this project we (1) examined the extent of this storm and previous storms by looking for large woody debris that was deposited by the flood using aerial surveys, (2) surveyed ponds along the Kashunuk River in the central Y-K Delta for salinity and fine debris deposition that would indicate the &lsquo;high water mark&rsquo; of the flood, and (3) examined soils and plants near Old Chevak, AK to determine the impacts of the flood. All sampling took place between May and August 2023. From aerial surveys, we located nearly 5000 pieces of woody debris, typically single or clusters of large logs. The majority of these logs were found at approximately 2.5 m above sea level, but many were found as high in elevation as 3.5 m. From river surveys, we observed fine debris deposited on the edge of the permafrost plateau at 3.9 m above sea level suggesting a substantial portion of the tundra in the region was flooded by the storm. Ponds along the Kashunuk River were saline toward the mouth of the river, but were low in salinity further inland. A comparison of ponds that were measured before and after the storm suggests that although the region was inundated by the Bearing Sea, pond water salinity did not increase. Our surveys of plants and soils, however, suggest some impacts of the flood. For example, soils on the permafrost plateau that were flooded were higher in salinity and pH and had greater thaw depth than soils that were not flooded. Respiration of carbon dioxide from these flooded soils was greater indicating the flood enhanced carbon loss from these carbon-rich ecosystems. We also found that debris deposition from the flood altered the timing of budburst and flowering in common species examined including dwarf birch, Labrador tea, and cloudberry and that altering the timing of these biological events likely contributed to the decline we observed in the key plant trait &lsquo;leaf dry matter composition&rsquo; of these species. The flood, however, did not decrease the biomass of plants in our study area. In this project we trained two graduate students, two undergraduate students, and one post-graduate technician in field sampling of pond water, soils, soil respiration, plant phenology (timing of biological activity), and the point intercept method of plant species composition. Three Master&rsquo;s students also gained geospatial skills and experience through the geolocation of debris and creating the debris maps. We reported our findings in one presentation at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union and plan to report additional findings at the Annual Meeting of the Ecological Society of America and in two scientific publications. We have released or will soon release four data sets describing the locations of woody debris, pond water salinity, and impacts of the flood on soils and plants. We have also created an ESRI StoryMap describing the aerial survey activity and maps of the woody debris that are being shared with the residents of the village of Chevak, AK.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/31/2025<br>\nModified by: A Joshua&nbsp;Leffler</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2302105/2302105_10838113_1743423931623_river_aerial_survey_small--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2302105/2302105_10838113_1743423931623_river_aerial_survey_small--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Map of the aerial survey area\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2302105/2302105_10838113_1743423931623_river_aerial_survey_small--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Map of the aerial survey area\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Survey area for debris from the Typhoon Merck flood.
