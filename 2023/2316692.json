 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nGrowing energy demands worldwide have driven a need for clean energy sources; next-generation nuclear reactors promise to fulfill this need by serving as a stable, high production energy source with low emissions. Furthermore, the extreme internal conditions predicted for these next-generation nuclear reactors have led to considerable interest in the development of novel metal alloys capable of withstanding high temperatures, mechanical stresses, and radiation damage. This proposal is exploring the behavior of a new class of metal alloys, called complexion-containing alloys, that promise exceptional stability under high temperatures and radiation due to their unique structure. Cutting-edge microscopy techniques are being utilized to examine the structural changes caused by radiation and determine the feasibility of using complexion-containing alloys within the extreme environment of next-generation nuclear reactors. In addition, this project incorporates opportunities for community engagement, such as participation in Research Experiences for Undergraduates Programs, collaborations with existing programs at the University of California, Santa Barbara that cater to students from underrepresented communities in STEM, and the development of a website for disseminating education resources for immigrant student/researchers.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis project explores the fundamental mechanisms that govern thermal stability and radiation tolerance in novel nanocrystalline complexion-containing alloys. Targeted ion irradiation studies coupled with in-situ testing tools in high-resolution transmission electron microscopes are being utilized to investigate the influence of ion irradiation induced damage on complexions and the subsequent implications for material properties exhibited during, and post-, irradiation. The objectives of the proposed research are: (a) design and create a model nanocrystalline alloy containing complexions, (b) probe microstructural changes pre- and post-irradiation as a function of temperature and dose to explore the influence of radiation defects on complexion behavior, and (c) utilize a suite of in-situ irradiation, heating, and mechanical testing techniques to develop an understanding of the underlying mechanisms through real-time visualization. In addition to its research endeavors, this proposal is expanding opportunities for underrepresented communities in STEM fields through mentoring opportunities at the undergraduate level, education programs for K-12 schools, and providing educational resources for immigrant student/researchers, with a particular focus on expanding educational and research pathways between the U.S. and Brazil.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
