 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extremely low light levels or low numbers of photons require the use of extremely sensitive optical detectors.  Challenges of working with these low light levels impact many applications such as optical quantum communication, nuclear imaging, and light detection and ranging.  Single photon avalanche diodes are capable of a response from only a single photon and Silicon Photomultipliers are effectively an array of single photon avalanche diodes. A novel form of these detectors, known as perimeter gated single photon avalanche diodes (PGSPAD) have been successfully demonstrated in the commercial CMOS processes which drive modern technological advances such as the cell phone. This project seeks to extend this new device into successful implementation in other technologies and to develop the full detection system.  The broader significance lies in the development of models and architectures for new scalable single photon detectors which will impact basic science and influence fields such as national security, geographical studies, space exploration, and public health. The project incorporates mentoring of a diverse population of rising 12th graders, undergraduate students, and graduate students by leveraging existing training programs at the University of Tennessee. Results from this research will be disseminated through conferences and journals as well as through creation of short summary videos.\r\n\r\nThe project leverages perimeter gated single photon avalanche diodes to develop scalable detection systems. The additional polysilicon gate of perimeter gated single photon avalanche diodes can adjust important device properties such as the dark count rate and the breakdown voltage. This adjustment facilitates correcting non-uniformity of detector characteristics, such as the noise, dynamic range, and photon detection probabilities, across an array of devices. This project seeks to adapt the existing PGSPAD devices to other technologies, such as silicon on insulator based technology, through fabrication of test structures to verify physics based device and optical simulations, the development of a scalable architecture based on tileable sub-modules and wireless transmission across a stacked chip structure, and integration of processing directly into the detection system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
