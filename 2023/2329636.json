 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports travel of a diverse group of approximately 25 dissertation-stage students at U.S. institutions to participate in an international doctoral consortium with distinguished research faculty. The Communication, and Digital Technology, and Organization (CTO) doctoral consortium at the 2023 Academy of Management (AOM) convention in Boston, Massachusetts, will consist of one and a half days of talks and interactions among students and researchers. The CTO doctoral consortium provides students with feedback on their work from other students and faculty members, allowing them to enhance their own dissertation research proposals. Additionally, because of the diversity of the business sub-disciplines and communities involved in the AOM conference, the consortium will allow students to establish research connections beyond their own disciplines. Consequently, participation will allow students to develop a better understanding of the different research communities, which will facilitate their participation in future interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this travel grant is that it provides a forum for doctoral students to exchange insights and receive feedback and guidance in order to strengthen the quality of their dissertation research, and its broader impact lies in facilitating the establishment of new research collaborations and professional networks, as well as developing a greater awareness of ongoing cutting-edge research in the fields of organizational communication, information systems, and management research into the impact and role of digital technologies in organizations and society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
