 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a 6-week program titled the Summer Geometry Institute (SGI), a workshop intended to introduce a broad pool of students to geometry processing research through immersive interaction with top researchers in the discipline.  The Institute will be held July 19-August 28, 2021 online; more information can be found on its website (http://geometry.institute).  Overall, SGI aims to accomplish the following objectives: (1) spark wide collaboration among students and researchers in geometry processing, (2) launch inter-university research projects in geometry processing involving team members across broad levels of seniority (undergraduate, graduate, faculty, industrial researcher), (3) introduce students to geometry processing research and development, and (4) diversify the \"pipeline\" of students entering geometry processing research, in terms of gender, race, socioeconomic background, and home institution. The first week of the Institute will train undergraduate and MS student participants on state-of-the-art techniques in geometry processing, intended as their first exposure to this discipline.  Then, for the remaining weeks, student teams collaborate on research problems, with the goal of exploring directions suggested by senior attendees.  Beyond these day-long interactions, visitors will give talks on frontier areas and lead relevant tutorials.  The opportunity cost for students taking six weeks to participate will be covered by the workshop.  \r\n\r\nAs a discipline, geometry processing presents substantial theoretical challenges motivated by practical considerations of manufacturing/fabrication, computer vision, physical simulation, and high-performance computing.  Participants will be exposed to---and will advance state-of-the-art in---technical problems ranging from the development of a toolkit for discrete differential geometry to the incorporation of probability/uncertainty in the shape processing pipeline.  Participating in geometry processing research also gives mathematics students exposure to fields like differential geometry in a more tangible environment, coupled with computer visualizations and concrete applications with immediate impact.  Our workshop is designed to make progress on several concrete challenges in geometry processing, including development of robust geometry processing algorithms, design of high-throughput shape analysis methods, design of sensible machine learning architectures for understanding and processing geometry built on foundations from differential/algebraic geometry, and extending machinery from geometry processing to higher-dimensional problems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSupport from this grant was used to launch the Summer Geometry Initiative (SGI; slight name change from original title of NSF proposal), a new summer program introducing undergraduates and early master's students to research in applied geometry.\n\nSGI 2021 took place during six weeks in summer 2021.  The program supported a cohort of 34 SGI Fellows, who participated in the program full-time; an additional cohort of ~20 students were invited to participate in the initial week.

Some highlights are included below:\n\nA central aim of SGI is to bring a diverse set of new members to the geometry processing community.  76.5% of SGI Fellows self-identified as members of an underrepresented group in computing or mathematical sciences, and 17 countries were represented among the fellows.\nAfter the program, many SGI Fellows reported that they were likely to pursue graduate education (MS, PhD) in geometry processing and related fields.  PhD admissions are ongoing as of this report, and already we have seen 5-10 of our cohort of Fellows accepted at top PhD programs in mathematics and computing in the USA and abroad.  Several SGI faculty mentors reported they were likely to recruit SGI Fellows for their research groups.\nOut of necessity during the pandemic, SGI 2021 was held completely online.  The program pioneered techniques in online research-based education that we plan to use over the longer term.\nMIT EECS has used SGI as a model program for efforts promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) among applicants for our graduate program.\nSeveral research projects launched during SGI continued beyond the end of the program, and we are currently seeing resulting papers submitted to top conferences and journals in our discipline.\n\n\nReaders are invited to visit the SGI 2021 blog for write-ups by SGI Fellows describing some of the many projects they completed.\n\nData collection among the participants (Fellows and mentors) reflected many of the positive points above.  For example, one SGI Fellow reflected on their research experience as follows:\nBefore SGI I had worked on one research project only and I was unaware how mentoring styles could differ.
