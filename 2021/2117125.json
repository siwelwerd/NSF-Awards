 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation, Chemistry Research Instrumentation, Chemistry of Life Processes and Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B programs.  California State University at Monterey Bay is acquiring a 43 MHz benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer that has the capabilities to perform both routine analysis and more complex experiments and helps elucidate molecular structures of chemical compounds.  The instrument supports the research of Professor John Goeltz and colleagues Corin Slown and Amy Danowitz at California State University at Monterey Bay.  This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as development of battery materials, exploring quorum sensing pathways in interactions with small molecules, and carrying out research training in protein-ligand binding events.  In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structures of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate students in the sciences.\r\n\r\nThe award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels.  It will be especially impactful in providing critical hands-on research experience to students from underrepresented groups, first generation college students and female students at this Hispanic Serving Institution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
