 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Charlotte A. Abney Salomon at the Science History Institute, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating how revolutionary change in geochemical instrumentation during the 20th century has enabled better understanding of climate change in the Anthropocene epoch. Society\u2019s capacity to cope with this challenging new epoch of significant human-wrought influence on the Earth\u2019s geologic development depends critically on the future development of Earth sciences. Geochemistry transformed scientific understanding of Earth processes and the planet\u2019s history during the 20th century. The carbon cycle is central to understanding climate change, and geological processes are central to that cycle. Historiographically speaking, putting instrumentation at the center of this transformation can lead to new insights. Instrumental methods in geochemistry also helped 20th-century scientists better understand global lead pollution, plate tectonics, processes of mineral formation relevant for prospecting and mining, and the global hydrological cycle on geological timescales. All of this has become central to our understanding of the Earth, and how humans can live upon it productively and sustainably. If we want to mitigate climate change in the future, managing the carbon and hydrological cycles is crucial. Effective management will require an understanding of the nature, scope, limits and utility of our knowledge of these processes. This project will show how understanding technical change in geochemistry is vital to a fuller understanding of the dynamics of these sciences, which is in turn crucial for tackling climate change.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project engages scholarship on the history of chemistry and Earth science, the philosophy of the historical sciences, and technoscience, to answer three research questions. First, what technical changes did geochemistry undergo to become a major contributing discipline in climate change debates in the later 20th century? Second, how did the epistemic aims of geochemistry change, during this same period? Third, what correlations and causal relationships exist between the technical and epistemic changes? To address these questions, the project employs qualitative and quantitative methods to track the history and use of geochemical techniques in the US and Europe from, roughly, 1919 to the 1990s. Methods for data collection include literature reviews, archival research, hands-on examination of instruments, scientometric methods to detect trends in the aims pursued by the discipline, and logical analysis to determine how the technology supported, or failed to support, historical claims in geochemistry. This research sheds light on the kind of access geochemistry can give to the history of the environment, and what key lessons have been learned from past developments in geochemical instrumentation. The practical effects are three-fold. (1) A greater public understanding of how claims about climate change are established, in particular their dependence on technologically mediated access to the deep past. (2) Greater clarity for researchers and research funding bodies, such as the NSF, to judge the capabilities of research on the deep past and to discern future lines of enquiry and analytical development. (3) Given that the development of geochemical technology was to some extent driven by economic and political forces, the project sheds light on the relationship\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
