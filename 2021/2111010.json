 "awd_abstract_narration": "Restore America\u2019s Estuaries (RAE) proposes two series of workshops, with estimated attendance of 100 people per series that will provide the knowledge, skills, and pathways to make meaningful improvements in the area of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice (DEIJ). The series will be divided into two tracks: one for coastal conservation grantmakers and one for coastal conservation project implementers. Each track will include content informed by a Working Group comprised of representatives of diverse, well-respected organizations within these target sectors. The first-hand input from people who work in these sectors will ensure the appropriateness and applicability of these workshops. Information will be gathered and developed into content by a consultant with expertise in DEIJ and supported by RAE in contextualizing this around coastal conservation. By aligning the funding sources with the demand for funding, this series can help re-orient funding and projects to improve DEIJ in coastal conservation work.\r\n\r\nRestore America\u2019s Estuaries (RAE) seeks to build upon a recent workshop effort to create broader and deeper impact around Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice (DEIJ) issues across the coastal conservation sector and coastal communities nationwide. The current proposed workshop supports the following  vision: \u201cAmerica\u2019s estuaries, bays, and coasts are resources for all people and should be safe, accessible, and enjoyed by all; efforts to restore and expand these resources must ensure that costs and benefits of any project are equitably distributed across all communities and that historic inequity of these costs and benefits are remediated through expanded investments.\u201d  This project will advance the DEIJ vision through engagement with two audiences: grantmakers and project implementers. RAE proposes the following workshop objectives: 1) Create a group of leading grantmakers and implementers of coastal restorations and conservation to commit to improving DEIJ in their operations. 2) Ensure coastal conservation grantmakers are equipped with knowledge and tools to help them address barriers related to DEIJ issues in their grantmaking processes, and provide them with a pathway to an improved degree of inclusivity and effectiveness. 3) Ensure coastal conservation project implementers are equipped with knowledge and tools to help them address barriers related to DEIJ issues in their efforts to plan, launch, and conduct their projects, while also supporting efforts to better incorporate DEIJ principles in these projects. 4) Facilitate sharing of information among participants to help them implement improved processes. 5) Promote best practices and lessons learned to the coastal conservation community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nRestore America's Estuaries (RAE) created the Inclusive Coast Initiative (ICI)  Workshop Series with regular feedback from participants and partners. RAE selected the topics discussed at workshops with the ICI Working Group, a group of influential professionals with diverse careers in the conservation and restoration community as well as an initial survey sent to early workshop participants. Through working group meetings, we decided on the topics:  \n\n\nimproving equity in grantmaking; \n rethinking your application process; \n partners, community, and program design for funders workshops and  \n understanding your community; \n building partnerships with your community;  \n designing your program for implementors.  \n\n\n\nWe narrowed these broad topics by examining current research around best practices as well as presentations from knowledgeable guest speakers. At the end of the presentations, we encouraged participants to ask questions of speakers before joining breakout sessions to meet fellow attendees and discuss the topics and how they relate to their own experience. \n\n\nFrom the workshop series we found five key takeaways. The first is that community engagement is a skill and an organizational process. This takeaway includes things like embedding community engagement into every step of the project, attending community events, and ensuring the entire intended audience for a project is reached. The second is to creatively fund multi-benefit projects. This takeaway delves into the idea of expanding the goals of grant programs to include benefits the community needs. The third takeaway is acknowledging history while building a better future. The key to this takeaway is remembering that organizations from the government and from environmental nonprofits have caused harm in communities in the past and acknowledging the hesitation with working with a similar group. Takeaway four is to emphasize learning by providing feedback.

The final takeaway was to reduce barriers for applicants. Some suggestions from that takeaway included having a grant applicant pool to meet match, simplifying application requirements, and minimizing reporting requirements.  \n\n\nThese five key takeaways are the core of the mission we hope reached our audience. From feedback we received at these workshops, we created a new series called the Inclusive Coasts Initiative Communities of Practice (COP\u2019s). The Communities of Practice are a space for people from different organizations to share their struggles and successes with different DEIJ-topics their organizations. To create the COP\u2019s, we created three groups, the Program Managers, Restoration Professionals, and the Community Engagement and Environmental Education group. We then worked with Community of Practice attendees to form a list of topics for discussion and have been working through that list at our sessions since! We look forward to the future of our Inclusive Coasts Initiative and hope to continue to make the coastal restoration field more equitable.   \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nicole Lekus"
