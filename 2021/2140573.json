 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) will support a collaborative team of researchers from Florida State University, Texas A&M University, and Carnegie Mellon University to operate under the supervision of the Miami Dade Fire Rescue Department and Florida Task Force 1 at the site of the Champlain Towers South condominium collapse in Surfside, Florida. This project will address the need for a robot-oriented model of rubble  by using unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery and other contextual information. The lack of a robot-oriented model of rubble is a major barrier to the design and manufacture of effective, economical, and reliable ground robots for disasters and other extreme environments. Although structural engineering teams are also investigating the site, they do not capture data about the factors that impact whether a robot can navigate the interior of a building collapse. This project will benefit society by facilitating the design and deployment of robots to save lives, either to find survivors in rubble otherwise inaccessible to humans and dogs or by reducing the need for human responders to enter unsafe areas. The team is diverse, with a woman as the principal investigator, and will train a diverse set of students to conduct robotics research for disasters.\r\n\r\nThe team will: 1) assist rescue, recovery, and forensic structural teams by collecting UAS images of the collapse from response through recovery, 2) collect and analyze data on UAS performance relating to flights, missions, data processing, and operations tempo, 3) analyze orthomosaic and digital elevation imagery to formally model traversability constraints for ground robots in extreme environments, including features such as scale, shape, and surface properties, 4) curate images for general use and archive on the Texas Data Repository open source dataverse site, and 5) attempt to create a 3D visualization of the voids in the interior of the rubble from the progressively uncovered site via a subtractive and labeling process. The research will create a new fundamental research methodology for analyzing disasters, and extreme environments in general, from the perspective of ground and aerial robotic systems. The image datasets may also enable the computer vision machine learning communities to recognize structural conditions and indications of survivors. The results of the study will be made freely available, including a workshop, and will improve use of robots in future disasters by formalizing design features and offering a rapid recognition of which robot types to deploy for what conditions. \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nIn June of 2021, the Florida State University UAS Team was requested by the State of Florida to assist Search and Rescue operations at the Surfside Condominium Collapse. This tragic event resulted in 98 fatalities and triggered the largest structural collapse Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) response since 2001.\n\n\nThe FSU team operated for 24 days in support of remote sensing and US&R. The team flew over 300 individual sorties with small UAS to collected imagery and develop maps, 3D models, and digital surface models of the incidents site.\n\n\nThis project allowed for FSU to re-process this imagery at the highest possible spatial resolution in support of the National Institute of Science Technology - who are tasked with the full investigation into the cause of the collapse.\n\n\n\nThis project was the first effort to reconstruct the interior of a rubble pile using a time series of orthomosaic photos. The resulting models of the rubble pile illustrated the challenges for ground based robots (of any form) and the overall lack of survivable voids - locations in the rubble pile where a human may have been protected enough to survive the collapse.\n\n\nThe lack of large voids combined with the small size of openings and surface composition indicated sever challenges to the successful deployment of any existing group robots for search.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/22/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DavidMerrick\n"
