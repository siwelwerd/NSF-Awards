 "awd_abstract_narration": "Perceptual decision-making, the act of quickly drawing inferences from sensory information and making appropriate responses, is a critical foundation of human behavior. The timing and the interaction between sensory and response processes in decision making are the focus of this collaborative research program. Neuroscience data has revealed that response planning may be engaged before perceptual processing finishes suggesting that the interaction of perception and action may be a critical aspect of making decisions. To investigate this, we develop novel experiments that use human electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the time course of perception, attention, and motor processes. We incorporate students from communities that have historically been underserved by higher education STEM programs directly into this research through courses, all-day science events, and a three-week summer school. There is a tight correspondence where curricula in the educational activities enable these students to carry out novel research throughout the project period supported by researchers. Graduate students play a critical role in the development and implementation of these student projects. These educational programs will be made available to other institutions that seek to enhance STEM education through research training in neuroscience.\r\n\r\nAll of the experiments make use of innovations in single-trial EEG methods for measuring the dynamics of perceptual and motor activity while participants make decisions about stimuli placed in varying contexts. Novel experimental methods are used to track and manipulate the time-course of attentional control of the flow of sensory information in the brain. A new area of perceptual neuroscience will be developed with unique tactile perception and decision making experiments. The summer school curriculum focuses on students proposing, programming, running, analyzing, and presenting their own research. The curriculum incorporates programming skills, matrix algebra and signal processing skills, and statistical methods. The goal is for the students to design, control, and analyze human neuroscience experiments. Interactions with graduate students and faculty mentors will enable students to realize their projects and develop their ambitions to pursue science careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe research goal of this project is to expand our understanding of the role of response (motor) and sensory (perceptual) processes in decision making. We addressed these scientific goals through a series of publications and conference presentations. The training goal of this project is to raise the stock of human scientific potential in the United States by developing programs that can be deployed to enhance STEM in underserved rural communities that do not have access to R1 research universities. We deployed these opportunities in a collaboration between UCI and CSUSB-PDC. The short-term goal is to provide an opportunity for PDC students to gain STEM skills and by contributing to active state-of-the art research in cognitive neuroscience. . One longer-term goal is to help them discover new future research opportunities and directions at R1 universities like UCI, and develop career goals in STEM fields.  The other goal of the project is to develop the research and training capability in cognitive neuroscience at a small rural university (PDC) with a unique focus on tactile perception. The partnership also provides opportunities for UCI graduate and undergraduate students to develop teaching skills for students who were exposed to varying STEM opportunities in primary school. In the project we developed new science content for PDC courses; launching NeuroScienceFest one-day activities at PDC; developing a novel three-week summer school at UCI for PDC students in STEM skills (experimental design, math skills, computer programming, data analytics) with a focus on cognitive neurosciences; internships for PDC students at UCI; and opportunities for PDC students to work on active scientific research with bimonthly support from UCI graduate students and faculty on experimental technologies and methods used to study perceptual decision-m\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/21/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RameshSrinivasan\n"
