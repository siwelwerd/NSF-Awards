 "awd_abstract_narration": "The annual ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS) is a leading international forum for the timely dissemination of cutting-edge research results in computer and communications security. The conference achieves that by bringing together researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to participate in several technical sessions, tutorials, poster sessions, panels, and workshops. The program of the main conference consists of approximately 140 technical research papers across a wide range of topics in the domain of computer networks security and online privacy. Participation in the conference is a valuable opportunity for students and is an important and integral part in their cybersecurity graduate education. \r\n\r\nThis award provides travel support to encourage participation in the 2021 ACM CCS by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field as demonstrated by statement of research, curriculum vitae showing research output, coursework and/or project experience. Organizers encourage participation of women and students from other under-represented groups in computing. Preference is given to undergraduate students participating in the poster session, and students with papers in the conference or one of the conference\u2019s co-located workshops who do not have other financial support to attend the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
