 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tyler Luchko of California State University, Northridge (CSUN) and David Case of Rutgers University are supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry to reduce the computational cost of calculating the binding of small molecules and ions to proteins, DNA and RNA. The ability of computer models to make accurate quantitative predictions about how effectively molecules bind with (or \u201cstick\u201d to) each other in a liquid environment is key to understanding the healthy functioning of biological systems or the structure and stability of advanced materials. But the models required to achieve the desired accuracy often come with impractical computational costs. To address this, Drs. Luchko and Case will develop methods to improve the computational efficiency of predicting the tight binding of drug-like molecules to biological and non-biological targets and also the diffuse (\u201ccloud-like\u201d) binding of ions around DNA and RNA. They will be pursuing new algorithms that offer a high degree of accuracy in the required calculations while also lowering the computational cost, by taking advantage of advancing hardware options, like GPUs, to speed up calculations. Both aspects will require iterative testing and tailoring to achieve maximum effectiveness. These methods and software will be freely available for broad application as part of the AmberTools molecular modeling suite. This work will directly involve students at CSUN, of whom over 50% are from traditionally underserved groups, thereby contributing to the training of a diverse STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nCentral to the methods that will be developed is the 3D reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) of molecular liquids. 3D-RISM is a potentially powerful tool for molecular modeling, as it rapidly provides equilibrium solvent density distributions and accurate solvation free energies; however, its computational cost is too high for many molecular binding applications at present. To preserve the strengths of 3D-RISM while reducing the overall computational load, Drs. Luchko and Case will develop methods to address the specific challenges of the tight binding of small, drug-like molecules and the diffuse binding of ions around DNA and RNA. For small, drug-like molecules, he and his group will create a thermodynamic cycle that employs fast implicit solvent methods to efficiently include sampling, followed by a 3D-RISM correction. For diffuse ion binding, they will optimize ion force field parameters and solvers for 3D-RISM to predict the stability of DNA and RNA at different concentrations of divalent ions. In addition, they will implement 3D-RISM on GPUs, to directly reduce the computational cost of the model for all 3D-RISM for these and all other applications. Combined, these objectives will provide easy-to-use tools and solvent models for calculating binding free energies that do not sacrifice speed or accuracy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe physical behavior of liquids in contact with surfaces or solutes is important in understanding the behavior of many systems in the condensed phase. This project uses computational approaches to address this issue, with a focus on the interaction of water and ions (i.e. salt water) with proteins and nucleic acids. We use a statistical mechanical approach (integral equation theory) to model the solvent, and have made progress in increasing the physical realism of the model, in making the computations faster, and in automating the application of these ideas to the problem of binding of small molecules (ligands) to proteins. A brief and non-techincal summary of the results in each of these areas is given in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe accuracy of our results depends in part on parameters that describe the interactions of ions with water. These parameters are generally determined by comparisons to experimental data. We have expanded our tests by looking not only at very low salt concentrations, as has been mostly done in the past, but also at finite concentrations that represent concentrations of ions like sodium, potassium, magnesium and chloride in a cellular environment. The new parameters can describe concentration effects more accurately than do previous models.\n\nThe integral equation models we use are generally accurate, but take a long time to compute. We are nearing completion on a port of these computer codes to graphica processing units (GPUs), which implement high levels of parallelism to speed up many tasks. We anticipate improvements of one to two orders of magntidue, opening the way for application of these models to a much wider range of physical systems.\n\nFinally, we have automated procedures to apply these models to the structure and energetics of binding of ligands to proteins. Many small molecule drugs work in this way to inhibit the action of receptor proteins. This is a very crowded field of research. Our approach has the potential advantages of being fast, of including all the proper statstical mechanical contributions to binding free energies, and of being capable of handling situations in which there are large strutural changes upon binding. We hope that these features will be most useful for preliminary studies that can scan large numbers of potential ligands with fewer compromises than are usually made in such surveys.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/20/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DavidCase\n"
