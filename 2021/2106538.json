 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution. and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) is establishing a project that will infuse interactive, multidisciplinary research activities in existing science courses that satisfy their general education requirements. \r\n \r\nThe project has been designed to recruit more African American STEM students to study Astronomy.  The project goal will be accomplished the following objectives: (1) the development of the hands-on research projects that will utilize the university\u2019s Observatory in physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, and math courses; (2) the upgrade of the Observatory; (3) the infusion of the research projects into the selected courses; and (4) the engagement learning community.  The project will enable and support the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based, innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of WSSU and other HBCU undergraduates.  Furthermore, it promises to support student recruitment into existing STEM majors with this novel approach.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
