The study will cover the period from 1950 to 2020, and it will be informed by broad engagement with engineering and related communities of stakeholders. The study will be conducted by an ad hoc committee of the NAE whose members will apply their expertise and experience in industry leadership, scholarly research, product development, public policy, and the communication of technology and science to general audiences. \r\n\r\nThis study will provide an analysis of engineering impacts on U.S. technical, scientific, and economic achievements; increase the visibility of engineering among diverse audiences; and illuminate the role of NSF on the engineering research enterprise, the economic strength of the U.S., and the well-being of its people. A major goal of this project will be dissemination to illustrate how engineering impacts our lives and the role of engineering and engineers in society and the economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
