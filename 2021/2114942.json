 "awd_abstract_narration": "From the food on our table, to the flowers that enrich our lives, pollinators, which include a diverse group of bees, butterflies, moths, and other insects, are required for the persistence of thousands of plant species in the United States. However, the webs of interactions between flowering plants and their pollinators are not very well resolved. Much of what we know about plant-pollinator networks, even for some common and economically important plants, is based only on observations of insects visiting flowers. One way to be sure that insects are acting as pollinators of a particular plant species is to examine their bodies for pollen of that plant. Large collections of insects in museums provide a perfect resource for quantifying pollen on insect bodies. Using the insect collections at the University of Nevada Museum of Natural History (UNRMNH), researchers will identify large webs of pollen-butterfly interactions, with a focus on the Great Basin Desert in Nevada. These networks will also allow inferences about how plant-pollinator interactions have been affected by changes in climate in the Great Basin over the last century. Additionally, the research will provide insight into how pollinators may be threatened by a changing environment. The project will include training students in ecology and museum science, expanding UNRMNH collections with pollen samples collected from museum specimens and butterflies encountered in the field, and creating large interactive displays for the public that illustrate the roles of butterflies as pollinators in the Great Basin.   \r\n \r\nThe research will integrate new techniques, combining data gleaned from museum specimens, field observations, and artificial intelligence (AI) to characterize insect-pollen networks over the last 100 years. Data from the combined approaches will allow quantification of historic and contemporary pollen-butterfly interaction networks in the Great Basin. This information will be used to test hypotheses about changes in pollination networks in response to extreme weather events and other commonly measured global change parameters. The project will produce an associated pollen collection, an online pollen image database, and an AI model for identifying pollen species from images. The results from this work have the potential to transform what is known about how climate change will affect networks of interacting plants and insects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The funded work used pollen on museum butterflies collected over the past century to document such changes. Two primary accomplishments from the funded research will help understand and mitigate such declines in the Western USA. <em>First</em>, an effective artificial intelligence (AI) approach was developed for determining species of pollen from images (Figure 1A,B). The <strong>intellectual merit</strong> of this AI method is that it contributes substantially to pollination research, providing a completely new resource for quickly identifying pollen samples for environmental research. Pollen museum displays available to the public provided <strong>broader impacts</strong> of the work and contributed to broader efforts to educate the public about pollen as well as the importance of plant-insect interactions. Additional broader impacts included transferability to other sciences, such as efforts to quickly and accurately identify pollen allergens that are responsible for substantial human health problems. Second, the analysis of over 100 years of butterfly-pollen associations in the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin (California and Nevada, USA) demonstrated that climate change has clearly altered relationships between pollinators and plants in this region (Figure 1). Specifically, the work documented a decline in pollen richness associated with butterfly species at our sites and an increase in the pollen grain abundance of drought-tolerant plants across the full time series. The <strong>intellectual merit</strong> of this work is the contribution towards understanding basic natural history of butterfly-plant interactions as well as the specifics of how pollination is likely to be changing globally. For example, the decreases in species of pollen per butterfly species are likely due to a combination of factors, including a decline in interactions, decreased pollen production, decreased visitation by butterflies, and diminished flower densities. The consequences of this reduced pollen diversity on butterflies are likely to affect both butterflies and plants in unpredictable ways and indirectly affect a variety of important interactions that depend on effective pollination. The specific climate changes that led to decline in pollen diversity were increased global temperatures and the intensity and frequency of precipitation and wildfires. The <strong>broader impacts</strong> are that these results could be relevant to other pollinators, such as bees and moths, and indicate that Great Basin communities are quickly shifting in response to global change. A broader understanding of pollinators? and plants' responses to climate change is a positive step toward controlling anthropogenic impacts on natural ecosystems and can support better decision-making in the current global climate emergency.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/22/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lee&nbsp;A&nbsp;Dyer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2114942/2114942_10721016_1697997802743_NSFannualReportOUTCOMESEAGER2023figs--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2114942/2114942_10721016_1697997802743_NSFannualReportOUTCOMESEAGER2023figs--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2114942/2114942_10721016_1697997802743_NSFannualReportOUTCOMESEAGER2023figs--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Images of pollen grains on a butterfly tongue and graphical summary of climate effects on plant-pollinator interactions.
