 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Mathematics (NASEM) will conduct a Decadal Survey of the Planetary Science and Astrobiology community to determine future research priorities of this community. NASEM will ascertain the top science questions and goals in Planetary Science and Astrobiology; the survey will also include Exoplanets. NASEM will also determine the community\u2019s priorities for future mission opportunities through NASA. This year\u2019s Survey includes Astrobiology on an equal footing with Planetary Science for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe Decadal Survey of Planetary Science and Astrobiology begins with the solicitation of white papers from all interested scientists in the community. White papers are submitted on a voluntary basis, and can cover topics from mission concepts to research focus areas to facilities, current or planned. Once the white papers are collected, NASEM sponsors a set of meetings to discuss these science and mission priorities and goals. The eventual objective is to generate a single cogent vision for Planetary Science and Astrobiology over the coming decade, and identify a prioritized list of science goals and potential NASA missions. The goals identified by the Decadal Survey inform NASA\u2019s research priorities in this field; they also inform NSF\u2019s priorities for facilities that can be used by this community, and inform NSF of the state of the community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
