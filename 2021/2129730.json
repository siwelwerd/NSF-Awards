 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides registration support for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to participate in the 16th US National Congress on Computational Mechanics (USNCCM16) that will be held virtually from July 25 to 29, 2021. USNCCM has been the premier event of the U.S. Association for Computational Mechanics (USACM) since 1991. The biennial event attracts a wide international and US audience covering broad aspects of computational sciences, including topics of fluid mechanics and solid mechanics, mathematics, biology, manufacturing, materials science, nanotechnology, high-performance computing, and data sciences. The conference will be attended by researchers and professionals from industry, governmental laboratories, and academia. Through this grant, the students and post-doctoral researchers will be exposed to the state-of-the-art developments in computational sciences and mechanics. They will also be given opportunities to present their research, attend career events, as well as conduct networking for professional prospects. There will be a special networking event for women researchers in computational mechanics. The organizing committee will make a concerted effort to encourage students and postdocs from underrepresented groups to participate in the overall experience.\r\n\r\nAt USNCCM XVI, the focus will be on the development and applications of novel, state-of-the-art computational models and numerical methods in a wide variety of scientific and engineering fields. Constitutive behavior, multiphysics phenomena, algorithmic advances, multiscale and data-driven methods, and uncertainty quantification will be covered at substantial length through a wide-ranging program. All talks, including plenary and semi-plenary sessions, will be live streamed. Students and post-doctoral researchers will participate through presentations in technical and special poster sessions. A panel discussion is planned with experts from industry, academia, and government labs to provide future directions and career advice. The Female Researchers Group (FRG) of USACM will also organize a minisymposium for the women researchers on the role and contributions of women in sciences and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
