 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nGeoscience, Environmental Science, and Environmental Engineering, collectively referred to as GEO-STEM herein, lie at the interface of science and society. Many of the grand challenges of the 21st century, including access to clean air and water, biodiversity, and the impacts of global change, rely on the skills of the GEO-STEM workforce. Unfortunately the United States is facing a critical shortfall in trained personnel to enter the GEO-STEM workforce, and what students are entering are often underprepared with the skills required to meet these challenges. Additionally, whereas the negative impacts of GEO-STEM industries and topics (resource extraction, access to clean air and water, etc.) fall disproportionately on communities of color, most individuals from these communities have been historically excluded from GEO-STEM fields. This is not only detrimental to the future of remediation of these negative impacts, but also limits the ability to unlock the talent available in this important and growing sector of the U.S. workforce. This project will develop a GEO-STEM Learning Ecosystem (GLE) in the State of Iowa that will increase student preparedness to enter graduate school and the GEO-STEM workforce, and will do so while increasing the number and diversity of GEO-STEM students at the University of Iowa. These goals will be accomplished through a series of extra-curricular and outside-of-the-classroom learning, internship, and professional development opportunities provided by educational, government, and industrial partners.\r\n\r\nPressing societal issues such as access to clean air and water, soil health, preservation of biodiversity, and the impacts of global change are all fundamentally GEO-STEM concerns, and to address these issues as a nation we must be able to produce a highly skilled GEO-STEM workforce ready to meet these challenges. Recruitment, retention, training, and mentoring students through critical transitions in their educational pathways are important components to address the overwhelming need for increasing the number of students entering the workforce. The PIs propose a series of collaborations, partnerships, and opportunities for a new GEO-STEM Learning Ecosystem (GLE) in the State of Iowa focused on the critical transition from university graduation to the workforce. The development of a GLE in Iowa will provide the education-government-industry partnerships that are required to generate the authentic, real-world, work-based learning that is so critical to training the next generation of GEO-STEM students. The project will create an environmental internship program that will be sustained past the lifetime of the grant that will provide students with important experiential learning opportunities outside of the classroom and outside of academia that will better prepare them for eventual transition to the GEO-STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Unfortunately, the United States is facing a critical shortfall in trained personnel to enter the GEO-STEM workforce, and what students are entering are often underprepared with the skills required to meet these challenges. This project was aimed at addressing these issues by focusing on building work-based learning (WBL) into the Geoscience curriculum at the University of Iowa, providing access to paid internship opportunities with industry and state agency partners, and providing novel opportunities for students to conduct coursework in an outdoor &lsquo;living laboratory&rsquo; on campus.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In total, 191 students directly participated in this program including 150 students who attended one of the field trips, 39 who participated as interns and/or mentored research students, and 2 who participated as graduate students helping to develop the Ashton Prairie Living Laboratory that is now used by more than 1,000 students outside of this project each academic year. Of the 39 students who participated as interns and/or mentored research students, 10 have already graduated and all 10 remained in the GEO-STEM pipeline. This current project follows on from the previous IUSE grant awarded to the University of Iowa (#1600429) and the results have continued to improve the outcomes of the Geoscience program overall. In the five years prior to IUSE intervention (2011-2016), 82.8% of all geoscience majors went to graduate school or directly into GEO-STEM jobs. This number rose to 88.7% during the previous IUSE project (2016-2021) and continued to rise again during this project to 89.5% (2022-2023). Student outcomes for the graduating class of 2023-2024 were not yet available at the time of writing this report. The most significant change in the matriculation pathway of geoscience majors during this current project was the increase in students entering graduate school, which jumped up to 63.2% from 42.3% during the previous IUSE project and 39.1% prior to IUSE intervention. These numbers clearly demonstrate both the efficacy of the methods employed in this project at the University of Iowa as well as the impact that support from the NSF IUSE program can have on student outcomes overall. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Key Outcomes and Other Achievements Include:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>150 students participated in levelled, non-field camp, field courses that were aimed specifically at awareness, engagement, and professional preparation for a career in GEO-STEM</li>\r\n<li>39 students participated in internships and/or mentored research opportunities (10 have graduated so far and all ten remained in the GEO-STEM pipeline including four attending graduate school and six entered the GEO-STEM workforce)</li>\r\n<li>Retention of UIowa geoscience majors into GEO-STEM jobs and graduate school continued to grow from the previous IUSE grant to 89.5% of all majors graduated</li>\r\n<li>The Ashton Prairie Living Laboratory is now a world-class teaching and learning facility on campus at UIowa where more than 1,000 students get to experience real-world educational opportunities each year</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/27/2024<br>\nModified by: Bradley&nbsp;D&nbsp;Cramer</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2119888/2119888_10762209_1732725451951_IUSE_Outcomes_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2119888/2119888_10762209_1732725451951_IUSE_Outcomes_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Outcomes for IUSE participants\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2119888/2119888_10762209_1732725451951_IUSE_Outcomes_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Outcomes for IUSE participants\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Comparison of decadal outcomes for all departmental students at UIowa (Geoscience majors and Environmental Sciences Majors) versus IUSE students participating in mentored research or internships.
