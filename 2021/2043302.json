 "awd_abstract_narration": "In today\u2019s increasingly connected world, reactive solutions to cyber threats have proven insufficient in stemming the tide of exponentially increasing cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure, industries, schools, homes, and personal data.  This project addresses the need for rigorous academic programs that will prepare future cybersecurity professionals who can develop systems whose components incorporate cybersecurity principles from system development through application. Building on  its various local partnerships and emerging research activity, Augusta University (AU) offers three undergraduate degrees and three graduate degrees that concentrate heavily on cybersecurity, cyber intelligence, and other closely related topics. AU has been designated as a National Center for Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education by the National Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security. This proposal positions the Augusta University Developing Immersive Experiences for Novel Cybersecurity Education (AUDIENCE) project as a catalyst to promote cybersecurity research and innovation while preparing future government cybersecurity professionals. \r\n\r\nThe AUDIENCE scholarship program will fund a total of 20 students over a five-year period.  Students selected for this program will complete their undergraduate and/or master\u2019s degrees as part of a comprehensive plan that involves interactions with government and industry partners, involvement in research, and participation in outreach activities. Options available to students for undergraduate studies include Bachelor of Science degrees in Cybersecurity, Cybersecurity Engineering, Cybersecurity Operations, Computer Science, and Information Technology. Options available at the graduate level include a Master of Science in Computer Science (with a concentration in Cybersecurity) or in Information Security Management, and a Master of Arts in Intelligence and Security Studies.  In addition, a cybersecurity learning community will be established to support AUDIENCE scholars and the rapidly growing local professional cybersecurity workforce The learning community provides the opportunity to focus both on cyber intelligence and technical cybersecurity topics. Broader impact of the project includes dissemination of the project team\u2019s experiences in cybersecurity education venues and in promoting a more diverse cybersecurity workforce. AU is uniquely positioned to increase the participation of underrepresented groups through existing relationships with Augusta Technical College and Clark Atlanta University and has a history of success recruiting diverse individuals for other scholarship programs.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
