 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps Hubs project is to catalyze an inclusive Mid-Atlantic innovation network to spur the development of deep technology startups that will have much-needed economic and societal impacts regionally, nationally, and globally. Research universities are positioned to support commercialization of scientific discoveries, and NSF I-Corps accelerates the growth and impact of university-launched deep technology ventures. The uniquely-experienced Mid-Atlantic Region I-Corps Hub team will build on the initial success of I-Corps Nodes to continue the cultural transformation at several of the country's top research universities to embed innovative practices into the conceptualization and conduct of research; to solve critical societal problems; and to create jobs, opportunities, and economic value. This Hub project directly aligns with the goals of the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act, which is critically important for previously industrialized regions such as the Mid-Atlantic region as it is experiencing significant economic turmoil due to shifts in American manufacturing industries, compounded by disruptions due to the pandemic. Also, the Hub vision and strategy prioritizes diversity, equity, and inclusion, particularly among underrepresented groups and underserved minorities and minority institutions like Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).\r\n\r\nThe I-Corps program curriculum is built on scientific methods that incorporate hypothesis testing, the build-measure-learn cycle, and continuous iteration. Multiple outcomes result from the program, teams: change research directions, get funding from grants or private investors, or form start-up companies and grow through revenue. Equally important, the impact of the program accrues over many years. The Hub model enables alignment of a systematic and comprehensive analysis of regional impacts, as well as the programmatic, environmental, and individual factors that mediate the efficacy of the program itself. Understanding for whom and under what conditions I-Corps programs are most effective, and what factors contribute to or detract from this effectiveness is critical to inform the continued growth and scaling of I-Corps.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
