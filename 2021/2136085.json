 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will bring together multiple communities that cross disciplinary boundaries and sectors to focus on shared Aquatic invasive species (AIS) data challenges in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). The Midwest Big Data Hub (MBDH) team will work in partnership with a committee of AIS experts and with national organizations including the other three NSF Big Data Innovation Hubs. Intended workshop participants include researchers, outreach and education specialists, and government agency staff.  AIS are a growing threat to freshwater resources, aquatic ecosystems, and wetland plant communities in the Midwest.  In the UMRB the potential for spread and impacts are especially high due to the proximity to the Great Lakes, the interconnected stream network, and an abundance of glacial lakes used for recreation. Much of the data needed to address the questions around aquatic invasive species movement and impact are currently being collected by various academic institutions, government agencies, and other stakeholders. However, the UMRB Region currently lacks a comprehensive inventory of the data available, information about accessibility, and data format standards. Further, AIS management is a multifaceted issue requiring data on numerous interconnected processes. Advances in technologies as well as data management skills are needed to advance data interoperability and replicability to address the challenge of AIS.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
