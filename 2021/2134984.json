New routes for the synthesis of stimuli-sensitive polymers.   2. Assembly of amphiphilic polymers in solutions into nanoscale structures.   3. Structural parameters controlling micelles vs. polymersome assembly in solutions.   4. Kinetics and thermodynamics of polymer complexation in solutions.    5. Interfacial stabilization of self-assembled structures.   6. Templated assemblies: 2D coatings and 3D hollow capsules.   7. Free-standing and free-floating films.   8. Structure-property-function relationships of polymer assemblies.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the symposium offers essential opportunities for junior faculty members, students, and postdoctoral researchers, including a significant number of women, to network with senior researchers.    The meeting talks will be publicized through the dedicated SERMAC website.  Students will be encouraged to present at a poster session, and there will be activities and workshops for faculty candidates and for students to explore career opportunities.\r\n.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
