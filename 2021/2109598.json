 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Identifying a cohesive theory of insect-host plant associations has proved one of the most challenging biological questions. While the ecological and evolutionary relationships between insects and their host plants often hinge on variation in a few key genes, we know relatively little about which genes drive host plant associations and how variation in these genes affects host plant selection or use. Where an insect lays her eggs has very real fitness consequences, making oviposition a strong candidate behavior to connect genetic variation and host plant use. This research will identify taste receptor genes involved specifically in oviposition and quantify variation in these genes within and across species of closely related hawkmoths that vary in host plant use. The Fellow will work within the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera Diversity to directly mentor scientists at the undergraduate and graduate level and to broaden knowledge of and interest in insect neuroscience both in students underrepresented in STEM and the general public. \r\n\r\nThis project tests the hypothesis that selection on oviposition-related sensory receptors acts as a primary driver in host breadth in Lepidoptera. The project focuses on gustatory receptors (GRs) because they are the primary sensory receptors used to sense plant surface compounds and elicit or deter oviposition. The Fellow will (1) test whether variation in gustatory receptor genes is associated with host use in species that vary in host breadth, (2) identify gustatory receptor genes involved in host selection by comparing sex-specific gene expression, and (3) test whether variation in receptor gene sequences and gene expression across populations are associated with population-specific host use. This fellowship will provide the Fellow with training in collecting and analyzing molecular data from an evolutionary perspective. Furthermore, the project will provide functionally relevant targets for gene editing in future neuroethology experiments and will serve as a model for studying natural selection on the nervous system; the Fellow\u2019s museum outreach activities and involvement of students in research ensures these ideas and training will reach a diverse, public audience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These fellowships have the special goal of developing human resource in biology. This award was granted under Competitive Area 2: Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment, and Phenotypes. Toward this purpose, the research conducted under this award was aimed at identifying genomic variation relevant to host plant associations in hawkmoths (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae).</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual merit</strong>: One of the primary aims of this research was to identify patterns of gene evolution associated host plant use across two clades of hawkmoths. As a necessary first step in this kind of research, high-quality genomes must be available for robust comparative analyses of gene evolution. Therefore, as part of this project genomes of three hawkmoths were sequenced and assembled: the whitelined sphinx (<em>Hyles lineata</em>), the bedstraw hawk moth (<em>Hyles gallii</em>), and the rustic sphinx (<em>Manduca rustica</em>). The first of these was presented at the Entomology 2022 conference and published as a genome report [1]. The other genomes are being used in active collaborations for gene family evolution research. In collaboration with Dr. Anna Hundsdoerfer, the <em>H. gallii</em> and <em>H. lineata</em> genomes are being analyzed for patterns of wing color, sensory, and detoxification gene evolution within the genus <em>Hyles</em>. In collaboration with Dr. Jay Goldberg, the <em>M. rustica</em> genome is being used to look a gene family evolution across the genus <em>Manduca</em> as it relates to host switches within the genus to toxic plants in the potato family (Solanaceae). In addition to genomic resources, research associated with this award produced two gene expression data sets that are being used to analyze chemosensory receptor expression in the antennae, proboscis (mouthparts), legs, and ovipositor of <em>H. lineata</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts</strong>: During this research three graduate students and three undergraduate students were mentored on moth-related trait plasticity, genomics, and neuroscience projects. This resulted in two undergraduate, first-author publications, and one graduate student, first-author publication. The PI used gene expression data that was collected to characterize chemosensory receptors in <em>H. lineata</em> in the design of a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) in the University of Florida Entomology and Nematology Department. In this course 31 students took part in hands-on research where they developed hypotheses about differential gene expression in male and female moth body parts, learned to use bioinformatics and statistics to test these hypotheses, and presented their results in a public poster session. A number of these students will continue to work with the PI to finish analyzing this data and write it up for publication.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentorship</strong>:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toshita Barve (undergraduate student, University of Florida)</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chelsea Skojec (PhD candidate, University of Florida)</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amanda Markee (MS student, University of Florida)</p>\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christian Couch (MS student, University of Florida)</p>\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isabel Aksamit (undergraduate, University of Arizona)</p>\n<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhys Campo (undergraduate, University of Florida)</p>\n<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rachel Walsh (PhD student, University of Florida)</p>\n<p><strong>Presentations and publications</strong>:</p>\n<p>Aksamit I, Dorig&#257;o-Guimar&#257;es F, Gronenberg W, <strong>Godfrey RK</strong>. 2023.
