 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this innovation is significant.  The US has more than 3 million miles of paved roads.   Roughly 3.5% of the network is repaved annually using a free-floating screed invented in 1930.  In the past 5 years, the paving industry in the US generated an average annual revenue of $25 billion. 3D paving lends itself to many possibilities, including correcting surface problems by applying a thin, variable-thickness lift, integrating color designs and striping, and imbedding objects such as sensors and solar panels in the pavement. If this process leads to a 20% cost reduction (conservative estimate) a cost savings of $5 billion per year could be realized.  \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project evaluates the feasibility of 3D paving.  There are two main technical challenges: 1) the ability to apply road surface mixtures using a nozzle (This requires engineering the paving mixture as well as the nozzle) and 2) the ability to control the nozzle position in three dimensions, independent of the vehicle frame and road elevation.    The project team will develop mix design parameters to enable nozzle application, a nozzle design to enable paving speed of 20 ft./min., a 3D nozzle control system to apply a surface independent of existing road profile, vehicle requirements, and a commercial feasibility study.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Reduce air pollution:&nbsp; A3DP will use only electric motors which are powered by Tesla POWERWALL with 13.5 KWh energy.&nbsp; Internal combustion engines will not be used to avoid releasing exhaust gasses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improve flexibility of operation and reduce road closure:&nbsp; Instead of one large typical asphalt laying machine, multiple small size A3DPs will operate at the worksite.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduce initial and operating costs:&nbsp; Manufacturing cost of the A3DPs will be drastically low compared to typical asphalt paving machines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manufacture unique patterns for speed bumps, rumble strips, aesthetics, or water permeability:&nbsp; Typical asphalt laying machines create a thick solid layer of asphalt block with flat top.&nbsp; Speed bumps, rumble strips, pothole supports are separately built.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/20/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Hesham&nbsp;Ali</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035768/2035768_10711467_1666237393424_Picture4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035768/2035768_10711467_1666237393424_Picture4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2035768/2035768_10711467_1666237393424_Picture4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The designed and manufactured autonomous asphalt laying machine.
