To ensure an equitable scientific future, we propose an ecosystem approach to educating and training the next generation of advanced researchers and social entrepreneurs that embrace the social sciences, arts and cultural relevance and responsibility. We propose a consortia of public education programs, minority serving institutions and technology companies to nurture and engage underrepresented students in advanced research leveraging connections from K-12 to PhD, with many career options along the journey. Together, addressing the gap in representation in advanced research and addressing high human impact research areas, we have an opportunity to reimagine the future of science and the potential for its\u2019 impact for social good.\r\n\r\nThis workshop aims to advance a technical framework for the acceleration of use-inspired convergence research in this area of national importance by bringing together practitioners from various public and private institutions including institutions of secondary and higher education, industrial and academic research organizations, social justice organizations, government agencies, tech companies and startups, along with students to discuss and address four topics: 1)Support for advancement of underrepresented groups in STEM 2)Social and human good research foundations 3)AI and technology supported education 4)Data trust development. An ecosystem approach to re-envision science and technology research topics, human good interests and interdisciplinarity to accelerate education in science technology and society has been proposed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
