Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. \r\n\r\nThe title of the project for this fellowship to Monica A. Lewis is \" The closed support problem over positive characteristic singularities\". The host institution for the fellowship is University of Minnesota, and the sponsoring scientist is Gennady Lyubeznik.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
