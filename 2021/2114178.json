 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant funds travel expenses for undergraduate and graduate students from US universities to attend the 2021 IEEE Global Communications (GLOBECOM) conference. Attending such a high-caliber technical venue is extremely valuable for students. Not only does this expose them to the state-of-the-art research advances in the field of communications and networking, but also affords the opportunity to interact with peers from institutions worldwide, meet with leading researchers from both industry and academia, and take part in discussions that may shape the future of the field, including technology, standards, services, and future challenges in communication technologies.\r\n\r\nGLOBECOM attendance will be particularly beneficial for the careers of graduating students, as the conference includes industrial sponsors offering job opportunities, and allows students to showcase their research and capabilities to potential employers. A recurring highlight of the conference is the Young Professionals week that exposes student attendees to professional opportunities, offers fireside chats with leaders from industry and major research centers, and features a best student paper award context, alongside tutorial sessions covering how best to approach research, development, and industrial opportunities that seek to hone future talent.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
