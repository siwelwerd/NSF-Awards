 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geoheritage and Two-Eyed Seeing (GTS) is an exploratory place-based project that combines Indigenous knowledge with geoscience education and research. A project team that crosses disciplines, generations and cultures will study dynamic and interconnected geologic and human stories about the landscape\u2019s past, present, and future.  The project will employ equitable knowledge exchange and other ways of knowing to understand the foundations of Earth processes. GTS aligns with the pressing societal need to expand and support diversity in the geoscience community. The project engages innovative interdisciplinary perspectives and new expertise, which challenges conventional ways of thinking about the Earth. The project aims to broaden considerations of the relationships between people, landscapes, and Earth systems processes. The work is expected to contribute to the evolving field of geoheritage in the United States. Results will demonstrate how braided knowledge system approaches nurture and complement deeper understanding of diverse perspectives and increase awareness of Indigenous histories, language, and knowledge of geologic landscapes among the broader public. The diverse team will also cultivate social consciousness through shared dialogue on critical issues related to belonging, access, justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (BAJEDI) through amplifying currently underrepresented knowledge sets in the geoscience community. The project will result in the creation of a geoatlas that includes geologic, geographic and cultural data, which will be available to a range of stakeholders in the Great Lakes Region.  The project also engages tribal and non-tribal youth in digital storytelling and geoheritage research.  \r\n\r\nIn this project setting, the Keweenaw region of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula on Lake Superior, GTS explores relationships with the Earth through the lens of both Anishinaabe-gikendaasowin (Anishinaabe knowledge) and Western science with two objectives: 1) the creation of a geoatlas \u2013 a publicly accessible, exploratory geoheritage database that combines physical, cultural, and geographic datasets that will serve the scientific community, educators, local tourist entities, land use planners, and the broader public; and 2) cultivate youth leaders by fostering cultural competency in tandem with other essential skills for career paths in the geosciences. To achieve these goals an interdisciplinary team of Great Lakes Indigenous knowledge holders, geoscience/geospatial researchers, and two cohorts of tribal and non-tribal youth will braid knowledge sets documenting the way that Nibi (water), Mishomis Grandfathers (rocks), Miskwaabik (copper), and geologic processes have guided and continue to mold culture and life. These qualitative data will be integrated as innovative geoheritage data layers in the geoatlas expressing these relationships in a holistic way offering potentially transformative impacts for the development of digital storytelling and long-term geoheritage research and increased cultural competency among the broader public. Further contributions of this work include: a) cultivating a diverse geoscience community by introducing youth to geoscience career pathways through multi- disciplinary, -cultural, and \u2013directional learning about Earth systems processes; b) creating foundations for transformative place-based, inclusive, and culturally-appropriate K-12 Earth science and higher education geoheritage curriculum, both informed by GTS project deliverables; and c) fostering a more diverse and equitable geoscience community through elevating currently underrepresented Indigenous knowledge sets in the geosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
