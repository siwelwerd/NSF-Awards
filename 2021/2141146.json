 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by convening a conference focused on increasing the number of higher education institutions that are committed to improving secondary mathematics teacher recruitment and preparation programs, ultimately improving access to high-quality mathematics instructions for 6-12th grade students. The Association of Mathematics Teacher Educator\u2019s (AMTE), Get the Facts Out (GFO) taskforce, and the Mathematics Teacher Education Partnership (MTE-P), will use this conference as a vehicle to address issues related to recruiting diverse mathematics teacher candidates, exploring transformational efforts relevant to teaching, and examining the role of equity in secondary mathematics teacher recruitment and preparation. New and existing partners will share tools and strategies for solving common challenges and develop ideas for local program transformation efforts. Broadening participation in who becomes mathematics teachers is vital; therefore, the project will approach recruitment and program transformation efforts from an equity perspective. \r\n \r\nAt the 2022 MTE-P & GFO Conference, participants will engage in focused discussions about the significant work of transforming preparation programs to more closely align with the AMTE\u2019s Standards for Preparing Teachers of Mathematics. The conference will be offered in a hybrid format, with participants invited to fully engage either in-person or online.  The in-person portion will be held in the same location as the 2022 AMTE annual conference, one day prior to the AMTE conference. An evaluation effort will examine (1) the ways in which the conference has expanded the network of partners who focus on secondary mathematics teacher preparation beyond the GFO and MTE-P communities, and (2) the degree to which the sessions address equity, diversity, and inclusivity; recruitment strategies; as well as supports for and dimensions of program transformation. Information and materials from the MTE-P & GFO Conference themes and sessions will be disseminated through the AMTE newsletter and the Teaching Mathematics Teachers podcast. By utilizing ideas of improvement science to support institutional transformation, participants will impact STEM educational experiences across K\u201312 and post-secondary contexts. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program support research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Since 2012, MTEP, a national NIC composed of K-12 practitioners and post-secondary personnel involved in school-university partnerships, has sought to improve the quantity and quality of prospective secondary mathematics teachers. Get the Facts Out (GFO) is an NSF-funded project between four national societies and the Colorado School of Mines, working together to repair the reputation of the teaching profession: the American Physical Society, the American Chemical Society, the American Association of Physics Teachers, and the Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators. To change the conversation around STEM teacher recruitment at institutions across the country, GFO produces research-based, user-tested resources and messaging that faculty can use to help improve their teacher recruitment efforts. The resources and messages are designed to celebrate the positives of teaching and to provide students and faculty with facts that address misinformation and common misperceptions about teaching. The AMTE GFO Task Force was established in July 2020 to meet one of AMTE&rsquo;s long-term goals to &ldquo;provide resources and strategies for recruitment, retention, and diversification of the mathematics teacher pipeline.&rdquo; The work of the GFO project is one of the organization&rsquo;s key efforts in working toward achieving this goal. The goal of this MTEP &amp; GFO conference was to engage participants in focused discussions about the challenging work of transforming secondary mathematics teacher preparation programs to more closely align with AMTE Standards using an explicit theory of change and evidence-based improvement methods. Participants learned about tools and approaches that could enhance their efforts at transforming secondary mathematics teacher preparation. In particular, participants: explored the foundational roles of equity in secondary mathematics teacher recruitment and preparation, in order to broaden participation in the portion of the STEM workforce who become secondary mathematics teachers; discussed mechanisms for forging partnerships across different types of collegiate, state, and school entities to aid in transformation efforts;explored and tailored tools that can support their efforts to recruit diverse secondary mathematics teacher candidates, adapted to the particular needs of their own local contexts; explored tools and approaches that help them to design, implement, and sustain their overall transformation efforts with a defined plan of action aligned with principles from improvement science and contemporary research on institutional transformation; and explored finer-grained dimensions of their transformation efforts, such as improving clinical experiences and mathematical knowledge relevant to teaching.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Both in 2022 (February 9, 2022) and 2023 (February 1, 2023) we conducted the conferences as hybrid events held the day prior to the annual AMTE conference, with the in-person portion occurring in the same location as the AMTE conference, and the online component via Zoom. In 2022, we had a total of 75 participants (43 in-person and 32 virtual); in 2023, we had a total of 123 participants (71 in person and 52 virtual). Both conferences featured plenary presentations by individuals and panels (focused on equity, GFO, and MTEP findings), as well as concurrent sessions for participants to further engage in the topics. All sessions included significant participant engagement components, with planned discussions and activities. Sessions were all well-attended, and remote participants appreciated the ways they were thoughtfully included in the hybrid sessions. In particular, we assigned zoom liaisons to each session, a person who was typically in the room (in-person) and able to call attention to questions/comments in the chat, as well as see if online attendees had issues with audio/video. The travel support that we awarded preferentially (higher amounts) to BIPOC attendees and participants teaching at minority serving institutions (MSIs) seemed to result in a higher proportion of this targeted group attending in person (75% of BIPOC and 80% of MSIs) than might be expected. Attendees had the chance to learn more about centering equity in the work of recruiting and educating future secondary mathematics teachers. Attendees further had numerous options to develop professional relationships with other attendees who are focused on similar issues.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified:
