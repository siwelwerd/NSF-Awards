 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chronic skin wounds resulting from burns, diabetes, ulcers, and other medical conditions can overwhelm the skin's regenerative capabilities, leading to persistent infections and even amputations in severe cases. Over 10 million patients with chronic wounds are treated yearly in the United States, with an estimated cost of more than US $ 40 billion in annual spending for treatment. Accurate diagnosis of chronic skin wounds, particularly in the early stage, can provide efficient and targeted treatment, ultimately reducing patient suffering. Current burn wound diagnosis and prognosis are limited to visual inspection by the physician and patients are physically required to be in the medical center to undergo expensive wound imaging approaches or the excruciating process of repeated bandage removals for inspection. Even with the latest advances in health, smart bandages can only aid in drug releases and do not provide real-time diagnosis nor monitoring. This proposed research aims to overcome the obstacles associated with existing burn wound profiling by developing transformational imaging and wound monitoring approaches that can be readily integrated with existing smart bandages to provide real-time information of the wound state without affecting their daily routine. This project will also foster workforce development in the rapidly growing area of bio-medical wireless engineering. New degrees and new curricula in biosensing and IoT technologies will be leveraged to promote STEM outreach programs and coordinate outreach activities. The latter will be aimed at recruiting larger cohorts of undergraduates and K-12 students from the local Miami-Dade and Broward counties to be trained in wireless engineering. Examples of our signature outreach programs to be leveraged include Engineers on Wheels, Engineering Expo, ENLACE (Engaging Latino Communities for Education), and the Miami PREP (Positive Youth Preparedness) programs.\r\n\r\nAccurate diagnosis and prognosis of a skin wound treatment commonly require the measurement of the wound area, maximal wound depth, the chemical composition of wound exudate, and type of tissue affected. In addition, sensors for non-intrusive diagnosis need to overcome the following challenges, namely 1) attenuation provided by bandages, 2) adherence to regulatory requirements while employing radio frequency (RF) sensors, 3) avoiding battery-powered electronics, and 4) accurate diagnosis across demographics. The proposed development of a non-intrusive, affordable, wireless real-time wound assessment device that can be easily integrated to a smart bandage is transformative as it unites the interdisciplinary research areas of biomedical engineering, network engineering, and electromagnetism towards a single goal. Specifically, the PI will be working closely with bio-medical researchers towards the, 1) Development of mmWave sensing system to estimate skin wound depth with ~0.1 mm accuracy, through electrical impedance spectroscopy, by computing the variation of the skin impedance as the wound depth varies, and 2) Realization of IoT-based wireless connectivity employing low-power low-cost protocol to transfer vital wound healing details obtained using integrated electrical, electrochemical and RF mmWave sensors, in a reduced SWAP-C package. The proposed research capabilities have the potential to revolutionize medical imaging tools for remote assessment of skin burn injuries, ulcers, and other chronic skin wounds, benefiting the global society by realizing a safe, accurate, and self-reliant burn-wound monitoring system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

More than 2.5% of the U.S. population, or about 10.5 million people, are affected by this costing the healthcare system $28.1&ndash;$31.7 billion annually. The prevalence is expected to rise with an aging population, higher obesity rates, and more diabetes cases, further straining Medicare and increasing patient suffering. Current diagnostic methods, including visual inspection, histological biopsies, and medical imaging, are either inaccurate, costly, time-consuming, or require physical presence, often adding to the patient&rsquo;s discomfort. This highlights the urgent need for a non-invasive, affordable, and painless monitoring system that eliminates the need for hospital or clinic visits.</p>\r\n<p>The objective of this proposed research is to overcome the obstacles associated with existing burn wound profiling, by developing transformational imaging and wound monitoring approaches that seamlessly integrate with existing smart bandages providing real-time wound state information. The goal is to create a non-intrusive, cost-effective, and wireless real-time wound assessment device that patients can wear without disrupting their daily activities. Towards this, the specific goals include, 1) development of mmWave medical sensing system to estimate skin wound depth with ~0.1 mm accuracy, through electrical impedance spectroscopy, by computing the variation of the skin impedance as the wound depth varies, and 2) developing a prototype to validate the proposed system. To achieve these objectives, the following tasks were completed during the course of this project.</p>\r\n<p>i)&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">Synthesizing first-of-its-kind arm phantom: </span></em>As a first-of-its-kind, we successfully synthesized a complete arm phantom comprising skin, fat, muscle, and bone layers (See Fig. 1). To achieve this, we utilized tissue-mimicking materials (TMM), commonly referred to as phantoms. While various tissue phantoms exist, each replicating specific properties of human tissue, our research focused on microwave-compatible phantoms. Seven distinct protocols were identified and employed to synthesize the skin, fat, muscle, and bone phantoms. The electrical properties of these phantoms, including permittivity and conductivity, were measured from DC to 20 GHz using a material analyzer kit (N1501A), as shown in Fig. 2. The accuracy of the dielectric properties of these phantoms, compared to those of actual human tissue, determined their suitability for inclusion in the arm phantom design.</p>\r\n<p>ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">mmWave Sensor Design and Development: </span></em>The unobtrusive prognosis of burn wounds relies on the principle of electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which identifies differences in the dielectric properties of healthy and burnt skin tissues to estimate the presence and depth of the wound. Burnt skin comprises a combination of dry (burnt) and wet (healthy) regions. The Maxwell-Garnet model is used to calculate the effective permittivity of this tissue mixture, leading to impedance variations. By measuring these impedance changes, the severity of the burn wound can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. This variation is captured through the S11 parameter (reflection coefficient). To enable this, a mmWave sensor (antenna) was designed using HFSS simulation software, incorporating a detailed recreation of human skin with varying burn severity levels. The simulated results and corresponding observations are shown in Fig. 3.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>iii) Prototype Development and Demonstration: </em></span>To validate our mmWave sensing system, we selected critical components based on the availability of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions. We adopted a modular plug-and-play approach using X-Microwave, allowing for flexibility in swapping and optimizing components to enhance sensor performance. Key elements included: a) a custom-fabricated mmWave antenna, b) two 18-GHz mixers, c) 18-GHz power amplifiers and low-noise amplifiers, d) low-pass and band-pass filters, e) amplifier biasing circuits, f) a local oscillator, and g) a microcontroller (Raspberry Pi). Additional accessories were incorporated to ensure secure transceiver development. This transceiver facilitated a proof-of-concept demonstration with the arm phantom. Results, shown in Fig. 4, present superimposed S11 plots for healthy skin and first-, second-, and third-degree burn tissue phantoms using mmWave sensors (antennas) 1 and 2 to ensure repeatability. As anticipated, the S11 response varies with increasing burn severity.</p>\r\n<p>iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">Self-Interference Suppression Approaches for full-duplex operation:</span></em>&nbsp; The mmWave transceiver design for sensing posed a unique challenge: suppressing Tx signal leakage into the receiver when using a single antenna for simultaneous transmission and reception within the same band. Unlike radar systems that rely on time-gating, continuous reception demands circuits with wideband and high isolation. To address this, we developed ferrite-based microstrip circulators, achieving, to our knowledge, a first-of-its-kind wideband isolation approach. Additionally, we addressed self-interference in multi-antenna systems through the innovative \"Twin-Array\" technique, providing &gt;20 dB suppression of self-interference and mutual coupling between neighboring antenna elements, all without additional circuitry. Block diagram representations of both methods are shown in Fig. 5.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/18/2025<br>\nModified by: Satheesh&nbsp;Bojja Venkatakrishnan</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2104879/2104879_10770577_1737218635359_Figure4_1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2104879/2104879_10770577_1737218635359_Figure4_1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Experimental validation of EIS\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2104879/2104879_10770577_1737218635359_Figure4_1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Experimental validation of EIS\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig 4.
