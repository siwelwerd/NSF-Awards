 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of small, portable technology for medical devices to improve the quality of life for patients.  Current point-of-care technology in healthcare is often cumbersome, requiring repeated charging, large area/capacity, and many device components.  The proposed technology reduces the number of device components, uses less power, and is lightweight while enhancing the measurement sensitivity.  The initial proposed application is to measure changing glucose levels for diabetic patients.  In addition, this design may be used for other sensing applications, such as disease tracking and other healthcare monitoring, the internet of things, wearable electronics, RF transceivers, photodetectors, military and space applications, electro-encephalograms (EEG), microgyroscopes, biohybrid robotics, and electro-cardiographs (ECG).\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of integrative circuitry that may boost the response signal of devices requiring low power and experiencing low noise or interference.   Based on technical models, simulations, and biosensing input data, the designs are expected to provide more accurate device responses, exhibit low input impedance, low input-referred noise current, low power consumption, low noise, high transimpedance gain, and operate at low voltage compared with current market integrated circuits for monitoring systems.  For example, this technology integrates a signal amplification device (transimpedance amplifier, TIA) that will convert the change of glucose levels to a more accurate measurable signal.  In addition, this device may be used for many different sensing applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
