 "awd_abstract_narration": "Daniel Vallejo is awarded a FY21 Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research (NSF MPS-Ascend) Fellowship to conduct a program of research and activities related to broadening participation by groups underrepresented in Chemistry at Georgia Tech.  The project being performed by Daniel Vallejo, entitled Triboelectric Nanogenerator Ion Mobility-Mass Spectrometry for Studying Cultural Heritage Materials, is to be conducted under the guidance of mentoring scientist Facundo M. Fern\u00e1ndez.  This project is supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.\r\n\r\nThe research project examines a new approach for analyzing the chemical constituents of cultural heritage materials based on the coupling of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) ion source with ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS). The approach minimizes sample consumption compared with traditional mass-selective methods of analysis, while also distinguishing structural differences of protein binding agents in paints and other cultural heritage materials that could not be identified using mass spectrometry alone. The research plan includes a systematic characterization of protein structure and stability in simulated samples, as well as development of a new database for compiling data that are relevant to the community. The broader impacts of the project include the importance of cultural heritage materials and the likelihood that studying these materials will broaden participation in STEM research by engaging students from diverse backgrounds. Activities supported by this project also bring together scientists and conservators at the intersection of science and cultural heritage research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
