 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fatemeh Bagheri is awarded a Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and education at University of Texas at Arlington. Bagheri plans to use a new technique to detect \u201cexomoons\u201d, moons orbiting around planets near distant stars. The technique allows the detection of exoplanets and exomoons through the radio emission produced by magnetospheric processes.  Her observational approach potentially opens a new window to exoplanetary research.  Bagheri\u2019s research efforts will involve undergraduates at a Hispanic-Serving Institution. She will also work to eliminate the known major barriers toward the inclusion of underrepresented scholars in science and engineering fields of research. \r\n\r\nBeyond detection of exomoons, Bagheri\u2019s detections would also inform the extent to which the surfaces and atmospheres of exoplanets are shielded and potentially habitable. Bagheri\u2019s research plan explores a method of detecting and measuring the magnetic fields of exoplanets via microlensing events.  She will work to break the psychological barriers to inclusion, by promoting a vision for excellence among students and training a generation of workforce with hard and soft skills.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
