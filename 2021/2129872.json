 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum computing has the potential of enabling the next revolution in\r\ncomputing. It can quickly solve problems that no classical computer could solve\r\nin any feasible amount of time. Recently, the impressive advances in\r\nquantum hardware have brought quantum computing from theoretical curiosity to\r\ntechnical reality. However, there is a significant gap\r\nbetween the theory of quantum algorithms and the realization of the algorithms\r\non physical devices. To bridge this gap, this proposal focuses on providing a\r\ncompiler framework for translating high-level algorithm specifications to \r\nlow-level hardware-compliant code. It enables programmers to take advantage of quantum\r\ncomputers without having to obtain significant domain expertise in the low-level\r\nhardware details.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this proposal focuses on the mapping and scheduling problems in\r\nthe compilation process for superconducting quantum computers. Superconducting\r\ntechnology, as the leading technology for quantum hardware implementation, has\r\nmultiple types of constraints that prevent the realization of the full potential of\r\ntheoretical quantum algorithms. The mapping and scheduling process deals with\r\nthe practical constraints of superconducting qubits, and are the most\r\nchallenging problems during quantum program translation. This\r\nproposal formally addresses the mapping/scheduling problems and models them as\r\ngraph-theoretic/AI problems. It not only advances the state of the art in the\r\nfield of quantum program compilation, but also pushes the boundary of the\r\ntraditional graph-theoretic and AI fields by linking them with unique challenges\r\nin quantum compilers. Ultimately it spurs the productivity of quantum\r\nprogrammers and unleashes the massive computing power of quantum computing\r\nthat will fuel the technical and economical innovations in society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
