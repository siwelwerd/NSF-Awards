 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Climate change represents a major threat to many forms of life on Earth. This is especially true for species already adapted to live in extreme environments like deserts. The pathways through which different species will adapt to persist under future climate conditions remain unknown. This research will investigate these pathways and their associated fitness tradeoffs in three species of desert-adapted birds in the southwestern United States. This project will provide insights into the mechanisms involved in organisms\u2019 adaptive evolutionary responses to a warming climate and improve conservation efforts by quantifying the likelihood for species to persist under future climate conditions. The Fellow will partner with local Tribal Colleges and Universities to support student-directed research and implement mentoring initiatives to increase success of students underrepresented in STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis research will use an array of advanced bioinformatic sequencing methods to quantify variation in the genomic, regulatory, and epigenetic pathways involved in the evolutionary responses of desert-adapted birds to climate change. The Fellow will use a heated nest box experiment to compare the physiological pathways and fitness tradeoffs involved in species\u2019 responses to increased temperature during development. By comparing gene expression, epigenetic profiles, physical development, and fitness of juveniles from heated and unheated nest boxes, the Fellow will test the hypothesis that species\u2019 historical abundance trends are associated with the effectiveness of their physiological responses to warmer temperatures. Understanding the associations between life history traits, adaptive response pathways, and the associated fitness consequences will fill critical knowledge gaps related to the evolutionary capacity of organisms to respond to rapidly warming temperatures in extreme environments. The Fellow will receive training in a variety of advanced genomic sequencing techniques and statistical methods as well as mentoring student-led research at area Tribal Colleges and Universities. Finally, the Fellow will develop and implement peer-mentoring programs focused on facilitating knowledge transfer and increasing the success of underrepresented groups in the sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
