 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways.  Extremophiles are a fascinating group of organisms that live in harsh and unforgiving environments; they thrive in the darkest depths and the hottest habitats. One of these extreme habitats includes the subsurface habitat of caves. Harsh conditions including no light, frequent flooding, and scarce resources have led to extreme adaptations that nonetheless are very similar in different animals (e.g. salamanders and fishes); this is known as convergent evolution. Research on convergent evolution in caves has focused on traits that have been lost (e.g., eyes), but characteristics considered constructive, or additive, have received little attention. Constructive traits include enhanced non-visual sensory perception, thought to be a crucial adaptive trait allowing these organisms to move about efficiently in their environment. Studies of constructive adaptive traits in cavefishes have led to breakthroughs in under-water radar technology, human biotechnology, and human medicine including an intravenous flow sensor. Understanding both the genetic basis and the physical attributes of these constructive traits will provide a greater variety of bioinspiration for technology. The future of biology is in biocomputing, and underrepresented groups are traditionally not provided opportunities by our systems to learn these skills. The fellow is dedicated to training the next generation of women and underrepresented scientists through workshops, class offerings, and active recruitment. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to better understand the molecular basis and morphology of the convergent hypertrophied (enhanced) mechanosensory (or tactile) lateral line system in cave-adapted fishes. The lateral line allows aquatic organisms to feel the movement of the water around them to navigate their environment. The first objective of the project is to examine the molecular (genomic and transcriptomic) basis for lateral line hypertrophy. The second object is to assess lateral sensitivity (i.e., degree of hypertrophy) through behavioral experimentation. The fellow will examine how the molecular basis of lateral line hypertrophy could impact the morphology and sensitivity of the lateral line through mechanosensory sensitivity experiments. This will be the first project to examine convergent evolution of a constructive cave-adaptive trait using both molecular and morphological means, opening the door to understanding the multiple levels of extremophile convergence in the dark.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

By examining organisms that have evolved in extreme conditions, we may be able to apply findings to organisms that are at-risk in their current environment. Fishes have successfully colonized numerous physiologically challenging environments, including the deep sea, sulfidic environments, and caves. Caves and cavefishes offer an ideal system to study adaptations to harsh environments since multiple lineages have independently colonized these habitats, turning them into &ldquo;natural laboratories&rdquo; with replication. Species within our study group &mdash;the North American amblyopsid (Percopsiformes) fishes&mdash; contain three levels of cave-obligate evolution (cave, surface-cave, and surface), with at least three independent colonization events into cave environments. While there has been significant progress in understanding the evolutionary relationships among amblyopsid species, the timing of their evolution, their colonization into caves, and the genetic mechanisms underlying their extreme morphological phenotypes (e.g., lack of pigmentation, blindness) remain unknown. With support from the National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology, Dr. Hart and her collaborators estimated a new time-calibrated phylogeny, tested for the macroevolutionary forces that may have instigated cave invasion, and examined intensity of selective pressure on genes related to cave-obligate phenotype. Phylogenetic reconstruction included all 12 extant and four extinct percopsiform species as terminal taxa, combining a morphological matrix and 1105 single-copy exon markers for a total-evidence dating approach. Our findings reveal a consensus with previous phylogenetic findings, recovering an eyed facultative cave-dwelling genus nested within a clade of blind cavefishes. Using macroevolutionary model testing, we found a positive relationship between global climate shifts and transition of fishes into caves. We estimated three independent cave invasion events, occurring between 11 &ndash; 29.8 mya, 4.1 &ndash; 17.3 mya, and 0.27 &ndash; 7 mya (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we explored signatures of selection intensity in 328 candidate loci by generating whole genome sequencing data for the 12 percopsiform species. We found genes under both relaxed and intensified selection in both pigment, vision, metabolic process, and cellular process-related genes (Fig. 2). Recovering signals of relaxed and intensified selection in genes relating to the same function evidences the complex interaction of evolutionary forces underlying cave-obligate and to a wider extent extremophile organismal evolution. This study helps our understanding of organismal evolution in extreme environments and links to impacts of global climatic shifts.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/17/2024<br>\nModified by: Pamela&nbsp;B&nbsp;Hart</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109469/2109469_10838956_1705513945883_fig1_15jan24--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109469/2109469_10838956_1705513945883_fig1_15jan24--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109469/2109469_10838956_1705513945883_fig1_15jan24--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Time-calibrated phylogeny of the Percopsiformes fishes and paleotemperature trends (Scotese et al. 2011).
