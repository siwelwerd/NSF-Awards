 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the University of San Diego, located in San Diego, CA, provides support for 10 students for 10 weeks of research and professional development each summer from 2021-2023. In this program, supported by the Division of Chemistry, students take part in projects representing diverse approaches and techniques, giving them a unique opportunity to explore the power of multi-disciplinary science. Beyond scientific gains, students will work side-by-side with faculty mentors to engage with issues of social awareness, justice, and responsibility in Chemistry. At least half of the students are recruited from local community colleges with otherwise limited opportunities for laboratory research. To increase the retention of these students in science, the site includes programming for academic, personal, and professional development on topics such as academic preparation, financial literacy, and career paths. Working closely with mentors, students will receive professional guidance, grow their scientific identities, and develop ownership of their research projects.\r\n\r\nStudents from first-generation, underserved, and diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds will be engaged in authentic mentored research that thoughtfully integrates social justice themes. In collaboration with faculty, student researchers will synthesize and study novel organic molecules, investigate nanoscale materials, colloids and active matter; and explore atmospheric, surface, water, and plant chemistry.  Participants also have the opportunity to examine protein chemistry and biomacromolecular interactions and engage in research projects related to climate change, renewable energy, clean water, and health. In conjunction with their research activities, participating students will also consider societal implications and impact of scientific research including issues of equity, environmental justice, and access to emerging technologies. The REU student cohort will also participate in discussions with mentors, peers, and invited speakers to explore issues of diversity, equity, inclusion and access in the scientific community and in society at large.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

REU students advanced knowledge in these field by synthesizing biologically relevant compounds aimed at improving the bioavailability of medicinal targets; atmospheric chemistry aimed at allowing climate models to more accurately simulate wildfire smoke plumes; the design and development of new electrodes for improving battery technology; synthesizing metal organic frameworks that are used in medical applications and sensor technology; developing methodologies to describe protein structure and function; developing new forms of optical microscopy for studying the motions of cells and DNA topology; and studying how diseases spread in populations using butterflies as model organisms. The REU students&rsquo; work led to 6 new publications in these disciplines and produced 19 new conference presentations. Multiple REU students from community colleges are now enrolled in 4-year universities such as UC San Diego, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and UC Santa Cruz. USD&rsquo;s REU program was successful in motivating and sustaining an interest in science among the participating students.</p>\r\n<p>Assessment of the USD REU program was completed using EvaluateUR and showed student gains in communication skills, creativity, autonomy in the laboratory as the summer progressed, in the students&rsquo; abilities to deal with obstacles, and in intellectual development. The assessment results also indicate strong growth in the REU students&rsquo; critical thinking and problem-solving skills, the practice and process of scientific inquiry, and an improvement in disciplinary knowledge, content knowledge, and laboratory skills and methodologies. Students and faculty mentors also indicated some gains in the students&rsquo; understanding of ethical conduct in science.</p>\r\n<p>A meaningful component of the REU program was that each student also considered the societal impacts of their science and projects. Students commented that:</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This REU experience helped me not only find a social aspect to my specific project but also work towards doing so in future ones. In understanding that research has historically been based on hegemonic thought practices, it is important to always take on our own values to make the research more inclusive, to think about how our communities have been related to the topic, and to understand how it can benefit our community.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;After my time working in a research lab for the NSF REU during the summer, I have a more in-depth understanding of our impact and how even the smallest finding and results can be of importance - especially when it can lead to a larger scale.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;My research project involved optimizing a video analysis algorithm by reducing the data required to perform light scattering experiments with artificial intelligence. The success of the project shows that artificial intelligence can be used for good. By supplementing hardware requirements with software, underfunded labs gain access to key analysis techniques.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This research experience gave me a new insight into how societal issues can be incorporated into STEM and how important it is to make sure that scientists are aware of these issues in the research that they are doing. Before this program, I wasn't exposed to many opportunities to address social justice issues so being able to incorporate that aspect into my research was very important to me and I will continue to be aware of these issues in my future research projects.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;My REU research experience had a significant impact on my understanding of social justice issues in science and among scientists. One notable example is the case of Maria Eduarda Contreira, a woman who earned a PhD in Organic Chemistry. Her journey is a powerful example of perseverance and success in an industry where women, particularly those from minority backgrounds, are underrepresented. Her accomplishments highlight the significance of representation and its influence on aspiring scientists. Seeing Maria Eduarda Contreira's accomplishments has inspired me to work harder and reinforced my belief that a PhD is achievable, regardless of current statistics. Her story demonstrates how determination, passion, and hard work can overcome obstacles, paving the way for future generations of women in STEM. Her presence in the academic community demonstrates the potential for all of us to achieve our goals. This experience has motivated me to strive for excellence and contribute to the advancement of science, while also emphasizing the importance of social justice in ensuring equal opportunities for all researchers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The overall experience and collaboration gave me a broadened perspective on the role an average scientists may play in an unending variety of social justice issues.&rdquo;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/10/2025<br>\nModified by: Tammy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Dwyer</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050846/2050846_10722318_1741650993552_USDBeach2022--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050846/2050846_10722318_1741650993552_USDBeach2022--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"USD REU Cohort Summer 2022\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050846/2050846_10722318_1741650993552_USDBeach2022--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"USD REU Cohort Summer 2022\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU students in the first week of the program visiting the \"beach\" at USD.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tammy Dwyer</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tammy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Dwyer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">USD REU Cohort Summer 2022</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050846/2050846_10722318_1741651084723_USDBeach2023--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050846/2050846_10722318_1741651084723_USDBeach2023--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"USD REU Cohort Summer 2023\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050846/2050846_10722318_1741651084723_USDBeach2023--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"USD REU Cohort Summer 2023\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU students in summer 2023 taking a tour of campus and visiting USD's \"beach\".</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tammy Dwyer</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tammy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Dwyer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">USD REU Cohort Summer 2023</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050846/2050846_10722318_1741651141221_USDBeach2024--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050846/2050846_10722318_1741651141221_USDBeach2024--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"USD REU Cohort Summer 2024\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050846/2050846_10722318_1741651141221_USDBeach2024--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"USD REU Cohort Summer 2024\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU students in summer 20234 taking a tour of campus and visiting USD's \"beach\".</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tammy Dwyer</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tammy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Dwyer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">USD REU Cohort Summer 2024</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
