 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national need of developing highly qualified teacher-leaders in elementary grade level science instruction. The quality of science instruction at the elementary level varies between school districts and schools. Yet, a critical national priority is to ensure that all students see science as relevant to their lives and see themselves as participants in science.  To achieve these goals, all students must have equitable access from an early age to high quality science instruction centered in students\u2019 experiences and communities. This project looks to improve elementary school science instruction by building capacity to develop elementary science master teachers\u2019 knowledge and skills.  These teacher-leaders will provide leadership to make the changes needed to provide equitable, high-quality science instruction in their schools.  This project will center on the needs and opportunities within the region that includes the university and district partners.  The results of this regional effort will inform an additional effort to examine similar issues statewide. Working with local schools and internal university partners, the project will explore and develop mechanisms to allow future teacher-leaders to more deeply integrate the Next Generation Science Standards into their teaching and professional communities.  \r\n\r\nThis project at Western Washington University includes partnerships with the Northwest Educational Service District and high-need schools in four districts in Northwest Washington:  Bellingham, Mount Vernon, Nooksack, and Sedro-Wooley.  Project goals include to: (1) Determine the needs and capacity for change toward equitable, Next Generation Science Standards-aligned science teaching in elementary schools in Northwest Washington; (2) Co-construct with school partners a sustainable model for teacher leadership development and support that enables the sharing of expertise across districts while being responsive to school contexts; and (3) Create a plan for science education faculty and elementary teacher leaders to engage in reciprocal learning that will result in aligned teacher preparation and science teaching in schools. Through this work, teacher-leaders will develop a community of practice and strengthen school-university partnerships. The model of teacher leadership developed by the project will contribute new knowledge to the community and may be adopted by other institutions. The project will be assessed by an evaluator with significant experience in elementary science education.  This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
