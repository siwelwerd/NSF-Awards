 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Zachariah A. Page of the University of Texas at Austin is developing light-selective boron containing dyes as catalysts for the synthesis of recyclable polymers.  The structure and reactivity of these dyes will first be optimized through systematic studies in order to understand their electronic and chemical properties.  Successful candidates will then be used to prepare dynamic poly(urethane) networks using light.  Poly(urethanes) are an important class of plastics which is extensively used to make coatings, adhesives and sealants.  The light that will connect individual building units into long polymer chains will also be used to disconnect them one at a time by simple changing its wavelength and intensity.  Hence, this light-toggling will lead to recyclability.  Studies associated with this research have the potential to provide fundamental chemistry knowledge associated with light controlled polymerization and how it can be used to efficiently prepare recyclable polymeric materials.  As such, chemistry emphasized in the proposed work also addresses the current and ongoing global issue of plastic waste accumulation.  This research will provide new opportunities for undergraduate and graduate student training in polymer chemistry.  Diversity seminars will be initiated, as well as development of a new course in undergraduate peer mentoring for organic chemistry.  Moreover, the work will also positively support public education and outreach.  Dr. Page will create an interdisciplinary polymer teaching module on light as a tool in science to engage middle and high school students from institutions with disproportionate populations of minorities in STEM fields.  Outreach activities involving intercollegiate student interactions with North Carolina State University will also be established. \r\n \r\nThis research will focus on development of wavelength-selective boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) photocages bearing benzyl sulfides as catalysts for controlled anionic photoredox polymerization.  The underlying strategy uses mild reaction conditions and visible-to-NIR (near infrared) light to reversibly cleave BODIPY derivatives and generate strong nucleophiles (thiolate anions) that can initiate polymerization.  Specifically, the preparation of recyclable dynamic polymer networks bearing (di)thiourethane and imine/hydrazone/oxime functionality will be emphasized as soft materials that remain largely unexamined using light-driven approaches.  Strong emphasis will be placed on the optimization of reactivities and kinetics through structural modification of BODIPY-based dyes in order to understand their electronic properties and responses to light with different wavelengths and intensities.  Proposed structure-reactivity studies could provide fundamental chemistry knowledge associated with the synthesis of recyclable polymers using photoredox initiated polymerization.  The proposed ability to control the polymerization by different light intensities and wavelengths has the potential to permit the precise 2D-patterning and 3D-printing of polymeric materials, with long-term potential scientific impact upon tissue engineering, robotics, optical coatings and image sensing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These efforts have resulted in a total of five publications in peer-reviewed journals, informing the community on design principles that govern the efficiency of this class of reactions and enabling next generation manufacturing, such as 3D printing, that reduces plastic waste.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>A summary of our efforts over the last ~3 years is provided herein. First, we began with the synthesis and characterization of novel BODIPY photocages bearing amine, hydrazine, and aminooxy cargo to prepare hydrogels as published in <em>Cell Reports Physical Science </em>(<a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(22)00503-3\">DOI: 10.1016/j.xcrp.2022.101185</a>) (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>). This study provided structure-reactivity relationships to improve the efficiency of releasing the basic cargo. We then wanted to apply this strategy to release more reactive cargo, namely tetramethylguanidine (TMG) as a strong organobase that had previously been shown to catalyze polymerizations between molecules bearing acrylate and thiol functionality. As a steppingstone to these molecules, we first examined a different dye class, coumarin, as a photocage scaffold, which was inspired by the work of Chris Bowman at CU Boulder. We synthesized a library of novel coumarinylmethyl photocages and governing principles that related intrinsic photophysical properties of these dyes to their ability to induce the desired polymerizations upon exposure to either violet or blue light. We ultimately published these results in <em>Polymer Chemistry</em> (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1039/D3PY00771E\">DOI: 10.1039/D3PY00771E</a>) (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>). Importantly, during our efforts on this project we discovered that several of the coumarinylmethyl derivatives displayed both the desired release of TMG, but also the formation of distinct reactive species (radicals) that led to an unwanted side reaction where acrylate functionality reacted with other acrylates as opposed to thiols as intended. This unwanted radical formation was attributed to bond breaking at a specific site in the dye molecules, which could be suppressed through installing a neighboring vinylic functional group. We also found that the radical side-reaction could be suppressed by adding a substoichiometric amount of TEMPO as a radical scavenger.</p>\n<p>We next began our synthesis of the original BODIPY photocage target, which contained TMG cargo. However, during this effort we identified two key features that led to additional fundamental research. First, we noticed that radical formation appeared to occur again, like what we observed for the coumarinylmethyl derivatives described above. Second, we noticed that despite our attempts to cage TMG it was not completely unreactive and was still able to activate the reaction between thiols and isocyanates in the absence of light irradiation to form polythiourethanes, a unique class of recyclable plastics. As such, this reactivity in the dark precluded the utility of these derivatives in light-based manufacturing. The first observation prompted us to again use TEMPO to quench the radicals, but we were surprised to find that stoichiometric amounts of TEMPO were required to quench the radical polymerization. Ultimately, we discovered that more efficient bond scission was occurring than with the prior coumarin scaffolds. We chose to exploit this as a new strategy where green light could be used to create radicals for curing acrylate resins given that contemporary systems operating by a similar mechanism required higher energy ultraviolet to blue light. These results were ultimately published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em> (<a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.3c05373\">DOI: 10.1021/jacs.3c05373</a>) (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>). We additionally completed our intended objective of creating a BODIPY photobase generator, which was 10x more efficient at releasing TMG than the corresponding coumarin derivatives. This work was published in <em>Chemical Science</em> (<a href=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/sc/d3sc04130a\">DOI: 10.1039/D3SC04130A</a>) (<strong>Fig. 4</strong>). The second observation prompted us to create an entirely new class of dye molecules capable of providing temporal stability, where the reactive cargo was only active upon exposure to light. We accomplished this by creating molecules containing quaternized phosphonium and ammonium functionality as the caged bases. Ultimately, we found that tetraphenylborate was a necessary counteranion to facilitate efficient uncaging and production of polythiourethanes. These findings were published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em> (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c07220\">DOI: 10.1021/jacs.4c07220</a>) (<strong>Fig. 5</strong>).</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/11/2024<br>\nModified by: Zachariah&nbsp;A&nbsp;Page</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2107877/2107877_10724069_1728655428911_Fig2_ZAP_outcomes--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2107877/2107877_10724069_1728655428911_Fig2_ZAP_outcomes--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2107877/2107877_10724069_1728655428911_Fig2_ZAP_outcomes--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summary of coumarin photocages bearing tetramethylguanidine cargo to create plastics upon exposure to violet and blue light.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zachariah Allen Page</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zachariah&nbsp;A&nbsp;Page\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2107877/2107877_10724069_1728655697738_Fig4_ZAP_outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2107877/2107877_10724069_1728655697738_Fig4_ZAP_outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2107877/2107877_10724069_1728655697738_Fig4_ZAP_outcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summary of BODIPY photocages bearing TMG cargo to catalyze aniconic polymerizations upon exposure to green light.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zachariah Allen Page</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zachariah&nbsp;A&nbsp;Page\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2107877/2107877_10724069_1728655522150_Fig3_ZAP_outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2107877/2107877_10724069_1728655522150_Fig3_ZAP_outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2107877/2107877_10724069_1728655522150_Fig3_ZAP_outcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summary of BODIPY radical photoinitiators to create plastics upon exposure to green light.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zachariah Allen Page</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zachariah&nbsp;A&nbsp;Page\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2107877/2107877_10724069_1728655318509_Fig1_ZAP_outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2107877/2107877_10724069_1728655318509_Fig1_ZAP_outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2107877/2107877_10724069_1728655318509_Fig1_ZAP_outcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summary of BODIPY photocages bearing amine, hydrazine, and aminooxy cargo to create hydrogles.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zachariah A.
