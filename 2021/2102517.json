 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry,  Vlad M. Iluc of Notre Dame University will study an important chemical transformation known olefin metathesis, using earth-abundant transition metal catalysts. The olefin metathesis reaction positively impacts numerous fields in academic research and industry, ranging from synthesis of value-added compounds to applications in materials science and biology. Catalysts currently employed utilize rather costly transition metals such as ruthenium. The proposed research seeks to fundamentally change this approach and could have a significant component of sustainable chemistry as an effective olefin metathesis reaction based upon an earth-abundant metal such as iron would reduce dependence on precious and toxic metals. Dr. Iluc and his team will integrate their scientific activities and results with the Center for Sustainable Energy at Notre Dame (ND Energy) and share their discoveries with the broader research community. The Iluc research group will work to enhance diversity in science by attracting women and underrepresented minorities to work on the proposed projects. The PI and several group members will continue their in person mentorship of teenagers at the Bashor Children\u2019s Home, a non-profit child welfare agency that provides assistance to troubled children and their families through residential care, and help with alternative education and other activities.\r\n\r\nVlad M. Iluc and his team at the University of Notre Dame will work to develop an alternative manifold for olefin metathesis based upon earth-abundant metal catalysts. Olefin metathesis reactions are well known for ruthenium catalysis, but those that utilize iron are only now being discovered. Recent workroom the Iluc group demonstrating that iron carbenes can mediate olefin metathesis reactions similar to ruthenium lay the foundation for the proposed work. The results from this project will likely provide foundational insight to guide future developments in iron olefin metathesis catalysis. In this project, Dr. Iluc and his coworkers will investigate the electronic structures and chemical reactivity of tethered iron carbene complexes and apply this knowledge to the synthesis and isolation of mono-tethered and untethered analogues for new catalytic applications. This research program is designed to increase broader participation in STEM through team-coordinated outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
