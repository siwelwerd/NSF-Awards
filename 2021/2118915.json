 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made for the acquisition of an 8000 m long, 14 mm diameter synthetic (Vectran) conducting cable that is part of a trace metal-clean oceanographic sampling system. It would be replacing an existing 12-year-old cable that has been damaged during water sampling in the Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans. Trace elements are crucial to biological and chemical processes in the world\u2019s oceans due to their roles as essential micro-nutrients or toxicants. However, conventional oceanographic sampling methods contaminate water samples for these constituents. Unfortunately, rigorous trace metal-clean procedures are labor-intensive, require specialized equipment, and are very slow, limiting our ability to study trace elements on ocean basin scales. As a part of the international GEOTRACES program a rosette/CTD sampling system that allows rapid, high resolution trace element sampling was developed using NSF funding. Since the cable is the only thing above the sample bottles, it has to be non-metallic wire to assure quality samples while still being as fast as that of conventional CTD/rosettes. The existing cable has been damaged after 10 years of use and must be replaced to continue high resolution trace element sampling in the world's oceans. There are two NSF-funded cruises in the next three years that require this cable. The request to the SSSE Program is:\r\n1)\tSynthetic conducting CTD cable, 8000 m x 14 mm\t$180,340\t\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Indeed, the trace element iron at a concentration of one atom of iron per trillion water molecules was found to be essential to the growth of the microscopic plants in the upper ocean, phytoplankton. These phytoplankton use the sun's energy to take up dissolved carbon dioxide gas, macro-nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, and certain trace elements like iron to grow via photosynthesis, just like the grass and plants you see on land. In fact, more than half of the photosynthesis on Earth occurs in the ocean. Therefore, if the oceans' phytoplankton have enough nutrients like nitrogen and micro-nutrients like iron or zinc, and light, they take up the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and actually affect the Earth's climate. Thus, biologists and chemists studying the ocean need to measure not only normal nutrients, but also trace elements like iron, zinc, and copper; is there enough or too little? However, they go on metal research ships to do their work and use conventional oceanographic sampling methods that contaminate water samples for these constituents. In the late 1970s to 1980s sampling methods using plastic sampling bottles and deploying them on plastic cables, then processing these samples in clean laboratories with filtered air and scientists wearing Tyvek plastic clothing and placing the water into acid-cleaned plastic bottles. Unfortunately, these rigorous trace metal-clean procedures are labor-intensive, require specialized equipment, and are very slow. To sample for trace elements like iron or zinc from the surface to the bottom of the ocean at 25 depths without contaminating them from the ship or handling could take 5 days, limiting our ability to study trace elements on ocean basin scales. As a part of the international GEOTRACES program (<a href=\"http://www.geotraces.org/\">www.geotraces.org</a>), a sampling system that allows rapid, high resolution trace element sampling without contamination was developed using National Science Foundation funding in 2008. This trace element sampling facility uses off-the-shelf components to minimize costs - a circular frame made of epoxy-coated aluminum called a rosette holding 24 plastic sampling bottles with ball valves (\"GO-FLO bottles\") that are electronically triggered to close at selected depths. However, to prevent contamination from the typical metal cable that powers and carries the signals from sensors on the rosette to the ship, we have to use an 8000 meter long (26,250 foot), non-metallic, Vectran conducting cable that is crucial to the functioning of the system. This cable is spooled on a large winch mounted on the research ship's deck, but it allows us to now sample the ocean for trace elements from top to bottom at 24 depths in less 8 hours (Figure 1); compare that to the days sampling time it took in the 1980s to 2008.</p>\n<p>The original Vectran cable was purchased in 2008 and has been used on research expeditions across the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans on 6 different research ships. It is very strong but it is sensitive to abrasion and working in the ice of the Arctic Ocean on the 2015 GEOTRACES expedition to the North Pole caused a lot of structural and electrical damage to the cable such that after its last use in 2021 it was time to replace it. This grant funded the purchase a replacement cable from the US company Rochester Cable and it was spooled onto our Dynacon winch (Figure 2). The sampling system of which the cable is an essential component is already scheduled to be used on an oceanographic expedition in the South Pacific Ocean from Tahiti to the ice-edge of Antarctica to Chile starting in December 2022.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/15/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gregory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Cutter</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2118915/2118915_10722483_1660543346710_GEOTRACESCarouselDeployment1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2118915/2118915_10722483_1660543346710_GEOTRACESCarouselDeployment1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2118915/2118915_10722483_1660543346710_GEOTRACESCarouselDeployment1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">US GEOTRACES Sampling System in use on a 2010 expedition in the North Atlantic Ocean.
