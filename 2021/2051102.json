 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve clinical outcomes for patients needing valves for vascular (veins) or urinary systems.  It is difficult to make artificial versions of the fluid control elements, such as valves, that are biocompatible and withstand the physical forces associated with their function, as well as the changing environment associated with aging. The proposed project advances a system to make artificial sutureless devices.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will optimize the materials and variables of manufacturing a polymer valve integrated with durable polymer encapsulation of a structural Nitinol frame. This Nitinol-polymer structure must withstand long-term challenging in vivo conditions while maintaining a physical interface that does not experience premature delamination and loss of device functionality. Polyurethane materials have excellent mechanical properties for rigorous applications and history of use in implants. This project explores the phase space of relevant parameters for manufacturing and deployment of these valves at scale.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The proliferation of medical devices to treat challenging diseases and conditions has led to broad improvements in the health and quality of life of people and pets worldwide. The advancement of the manufacturing technologies, such as Venarum?s proprietary integrated valve manufacturing process (?IV-Process?), has enabled creation of devices that previously were too complex to consistently manufacture. \nVenarum?s intended first commercial device using the IV-Process is its Canine INCONTrol Urethral Valve system (?K9&#8208;ICT?).  The K9-ICT is a novel urethral implant solution for the treatment of urinary incontinence (?UI?) in canines.  The transurethral, catheter&#8208;delivered K9&#8208;ICT is intended to work with the natural voiding initiation mechanism to control the flow of urine in order to reduce urine leakage and other complications of UI.  Treating canine UI in a durable single treatment would give both dogs and dog owners a significant, cost-effective and lasting improvement to quality of life. Successful development, demonstration and commercialization of a durable and biomimetic treatment for canine UI will provide valuable understanding for the treatment of urinary flow disorders. \n\nSoon after the onset of this Phase I development, the K9-ICT valve mechanism design was changed from a complex inverted valve with hysteresis to a relief valve, and with this, prong features were added to the frame.  The goals under the NSF funding were met and the new design and manufacturing development allowed each aspect of the flow performance to be controlled and adjusted as needed to meet device requirements.  The implemented improvements and controls reduced variability in orifice cut quality and dimensions, prong heat treatment and design, and valve coating thickness, which all contribute to overall device delivery, implantation, and flow performance.  The mechanical aspects of the K9-ICT implant were demonstrated through simulated-use bench testing, a holistic flow performance bench test, and later verified in chronic animal testing. The bench flow testing showed significant improvement in valve control and repeatability as a result of the completed grant work.

The canine exhibited normal urination over 3 days, as intended for the total in-life study duration.\n\nWhile the current product is focused on canine patients, we expect the outcomes will contribute to a path forward for a similar UI device for treatments of humans.  In general, the IV-Process provides the ability to make novel three dimensional fully encapsulated devices with an integrated centric valve, and ability to be implanted by minimally invasive procedure.  With the IV-Process, Venarum hopes to offer the medical device community implantable products where optimization of bodily fluid flow is paramount to success. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/06/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Janet Burpee"
