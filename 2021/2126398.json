 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the quality of life for people who suffer from debilitating forms of paralysis by restoring their lost functionality. There are 5.4 million people in the United States who suffer from paralysis. Not only do these patients suffer from the physical pain that comes with their condition but also, they are afflicted by financial and psychological burdens. The prostheses that are being used today are either passive and affordable or active and unaffordable for the majority of these patients. Active prostheses represent the forefront of brain-computer interfaces development. Current protheses suffer from drawbacks such as constant patient training, the necessity for bulky skin electrodes, variability in electrode positioning, and limited efficacy when worn and operated by the patients themselves. This device first targets incomplete paralysis by functioning as a neural relay station that bridges the disconnect between the healthy neural section above and below the site of injury.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to overcome the limitations of current brain-computer interfaces to not only restore functionality in people with paralysis, but to recreate a real-time, seamless experience for them. Most available neural probes rely on highly invasive, sharp shanks to penetrate neural tissue.  These probes cause considerable inflammation, ultimately leading to device failure. Current devices detect signals extracellularly which leads to a  low signal-to-noise ratio making signal extraction very challenging. This project will improve brain-computer interfaces by introducing nanoarchitecture to the sensing electrode in order to achieve intracellular sensing. This sensing dramatically increases the signal-to-noise ratio making signal extraction considerably simpler. This device is based on an active pixel complementary metal oxide semiconductor architecture which will turn neural signals into a string of ones and zeros making signal extraction considerably simpler. This process will minimize the patient-interface training time. This project will fabricate three-dimensional, nano-architected sensing electrodes with high-aspect ratio and high-density nanoneedles, mimicking the natural neural cell environment. The nanoneedles spontaneously penetrate neurons, achieve superior intracellular recording, and reduce chronic inflammation to promote device longevity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The major limitations of cortical devices are inherent to the brain?s architecture which is comprised of billions of neurons that are connected through an extremely complex three-dimensional network that is only partially mapped. For example, any given cortical neuron synapse is often competing with thousands of other excitatory and inhibitory neuron synapses. Due to this competitive complexity, recording from any given neuron fails to provide a sufficient, absolute value signal. As a result, a relatively large body of neurons needs to be interrogated to enable deciphering of neuronal patterns that are ultimately associated with a target behavior.

In particular, the white matter of the spinal cord is mostly composed of a set of one-way channels that connect the brain and periphery, which makes movement and sensation possible. The major carriers of motor and sensory information in the spinal cord are axon bundles which are organized in tracts that form a regional map of the body. For example, pressure applied to the big toe is relayed to the brain via a medial region of the fasciculus gracilis, while motion of the shoulder is localized in the medial region of the lateral cortico-spinal tract. As a result of this intrinsic map provided by the spinal cord, signal decoding becomes drastically easier than in the cerebral cortex, leading to minimal patient-interface training, which greatly simplifies the adoption of spinal interfaces.
