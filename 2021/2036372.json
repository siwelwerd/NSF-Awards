 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop networked, wireless chemical and biological sensing for use in wet laboratory and manufacturing environments. The technology to be developed addresses a $16 billion chemical and bioprocessing equipment market with a large growth potential. The ability to cost-effectively monitor these parameters from the research phase to large-scale manufacturing will accelerate the development of critical products such as vaccines and cell therapies, as well as better ensure the quality of everyday consumer goods produced from advanced chemical and biochemical processes.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project includes technical and manufacturing advances that must be made to bring these sensors to market. This effort combines engineering development in networked, wireless communication and miniaturization with analytical chemistry development of key sensing technologies. The innovations include development of manufacturing processes for a novel pH stir bar, development of wireless dissolved oxygen sensing modalities, and methods for achieving wireless sensing in larger-scale, metallic manufacturing vessels. Technology will be developed that enables wireless sensing of key wet process parameters such as pH and dissolved oxygen for chemical and biochemical process monitoring in research and larger-scale manufacturing environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
