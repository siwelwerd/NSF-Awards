 "awd_abstract_narration": "A state-of-the-art, high-quality volumetric capture system will support multidisciplinary research projects at the Institute for Immersive Designs, Experiences, Applications, and Stories (the Institute for IDEAS) at American University in Washington, DC.  Volumetric capture is a computer vision technology that enables recording the topology of objects and people rather than, as in traditional video recording, the projection of three-dimensional objects onto a two-dimensional surface. By using virtual or augmented reality headsets or CAVE systems, volumetric captures can be viewed and interacted with from any perspective chosen by the user at the time of viewing. Thus, volumetric captures allow for a \u201cholographic\u201d experience that combines the immersiveness of virtual and augmented reality with the realism of traditional video recording.  Volumetric capture presents an interesting, yet unexplored, research potential across many domains, such as healthcare, education, entertainment, visualization, and communication, etc. Yet, due to high costs of system acquisition, volumetric capture and its application is currently being research only at a handful of research centers (e.g. Stanford\u2019s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, the University of California San Diego, and Georgia State University). \r\n\r\nAmerican University Institute for IDEAS was created specifically to pursue research projects in immersive technologies, including volumetric capture and desires to better understand the affordances and applications ordered by volumetric capture technology and have the public benefit from it, as well as try to make more accessible and affordable.  The acquisition of volumetric capture system will allow the 24 full-time faculty fellows of the Institute, as well as faculty and students across the university and the region, to pursue multiple, multiyear research and creative projects involving volumetric capture, including some that are already funded by NSF, NEH, private foundations, or other federal agencies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
