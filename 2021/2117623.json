 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award supports the acquisition of a scanning X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) microprobe to serve a large community of scientists at the University of Texas at Austin. XPS is a surface sensitive technique based on the photoelectric effect that can enable spatially- and depth-resolved surface chemical characterization of materials. XPS data is of great importance to the understanding the relationship between structure, properties, processing, and functional behavior of novel materials. Advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology hinge on developing such an understanding. The advanced capabilities of this instrument will have a profound impact on the research and educational programs at the University of Texas at Austin. It will enable next-generation materials research, especially for renewable energy, catalysis, electronics, environmental sciences, and health. The XPS will serve as a research facility of excellence for remotely controlled studies of advanced materials for southern US universities and industries and enhance the mission of center-level research activities involving a diverse set of faculties. Research enabled by the instrument will foster the creation of start-up companies by providing the necessary research base with state-of-the-art and easily accessible instrumentation. This instrument will also have a strong impact on the education and training of the next generation of scientists from graduate students to faculty. The instrument will also be incorporated into outreach activities that involve K-12 programs, community college students and teachers, and the general public.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of a versatile and high-performance XPS with several unique, state-of-the-art features will allow analytical measurements with complementary techniques (such as Auger spectroscopy and reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy) and in-depth analysis of chemically sensitive materials. The instrument has high sensitivity, excellent micro-area spectroscopy performance, fast acquisition of imaging XPS data, effective charge compensation on insulating samples, excellent angular resolution, and facile identification of regions of interests, as well as full remote access with active control capability. This will enable a wide range of forefront research and discovery in the area of materials science and engineering, nanoscience, and nanotechnology, including the development of low-cost, efficient materials for solar cells, batteries for transportation and grid storage, solar-to-fuel conversion, fuel cells, catalysts, low-dimensional materials, nano-electronics, additive manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, drug delivery, as well as water purification and harvesting. These capabilities will thus contribute to the development of a broad range of research and educational activities, including those supported by major centers at UT-Austin, such as the NSF-MRSEC Center for Dynamics and Control of Materials, the NSF-ERC Nanomanufacturing Systems for Mobile Computing and Energy Technologies, and the NSF-ERC Center for Innovative and Strategic Transformation of Alkane Resources. This will create vibrant synergies among UT-Austin\u2019s diverse research, training, and educational enterprise.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
