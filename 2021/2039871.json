 "awd_abstract_narration": "To help develop the nation\u2019s engineering workforce, the National Science Foundation has invested substantial public funding in engineering education research over the past twenty years. This investment has helped markedly improve courses and programs at many universities by testing and sharing research-based practices that promote active learning, increase student motivation and engagement, diversify the field, and better prepare students for work. At the same time, the investment has typically focused on researchers collecting new data, resulting in hundreds of data sets that remain underexplored. These existing data sets have significant potential to be analyzed and even combined in new ways to further support large-scale changes in how we recruit, teach, and prepare engineering students for the demands and challenges of the 21st century. Currently, however, engineering education researchers do not have productive and effective ways for sharing and analyzing data beyond the original project. Thus the full potential of these data sets remains untapped. This project will address that gap by developing and promoting a viable approach that will enable researchers to leverage the rich data currently available. In doing so, it will simultaneously improve engineering education nationally and increase the return on investment of public funds. The project will bring experienced researchers together with those just beginning their careers to identify the major roadblocks to sharing and re-using data, develop strategies and practices for overcoming those roadblocks, and conduct a series of test cases that demonstrate how to put those strategies and practices into action. The results will help create a paradigm shift that can move both the study and the practice of engineering education in the U.S. to a new level and spur the kind of sea changes needed to keep the nation\u2019s engineering workforce at the forefront of the global marketplace.\r\n\r\nChanging the paradigm of single-use data collection is a high-risk proposition that requires actionable, proven practices for effective, ethical data sharing, coupled with sufficient incentives to both share and use existing data. To that end, this proposal draws together a team of experts to overcome substantial obstacles in data sharing and build a framework to guide secondary analysis in engineering education research. In particular, we will bring together established and emerging scholars to deliver a tested framework that outlines methodological best practices for formally and informally sharing data, making data sets public, combining data from different studies, performing secondary analyses of both qualitative and quantitative data, publishing and sharing the results, securing the needed funding, and ensuring that the work is valued in the field. To create this framework, the research team will hold a series of six workshops over two years. In the first year, we will bring highly respected, experienced researchers from institutions across the country together with newer researchers to create the initial framework for data sharing and data re-use. In the second year, we will test and refine that framework on two existing data sets. We will solicit data sets from the wider community, and invite teams of scholars to conduct secondary analysis on those data sets, in conversation with the original researchers. Importantly, in selecting both the data sets and the approaches to secondary analysis, we will emphasize methodological diversity to ensure that the framework is widely applicable. The outcome will be a framework document that will comprise a set of tested guidelines for data sharing and secondary analysis in engineering education research, distributed through both journals and workshops to promote widespread adoption.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n \n\n\nSecondary Data Analysis (SDA) involves the re-use of data collected in previous research projects and is an established methodology for data analysis. However, its uptake in Engineering Education Research (EER) has been relatively limited to date, and this project sought to increase its use in EER by developing practices and principles that can inform this approach moving forward.\n\n\nWe advocate for SDA because its advantages include (1) maximizing use of data collected with public funds, (2) reducing the load on participants (particularly those from populations marginalized in engineering, who may receive numerous research requests), (3) reducing time to publication (particularly for graduate students), and (4) increasing equity in the field through data transparency. We also acknowledge challenges with SDA, most notably, how to legally and ethically conduct SDA without sacrificing quality or harming participants.\n\n\nThis project drew together a broad team of participants including early career as well as established researchers, and jointly scoped out two mini-projects used to test approaches to SDA in EER that address ethical and quality challenges.\n\n\nThe first project explored SDA for training newer researchers. The data originator was an experienced researcher with a large dataset from a completed NSF funded project. While the original project met its goals, there was scope for further analysis of interview data conducted with undergraduate engineering students. The SDA project involved a researcher from another undergraduate-focused institution, who wanted to train undergraduate researchers in qualitative research using an existing data. These two researchers navigated Institutional Review Board approvals to allow for the SDA, and then embarked on an intentional process allowing for regular check-ins with the first researcher to make sure the analysis remained contextually grounded. A key finding of this project was an unanticipated benefit for the undergraduate researchers, who derived personal as well as professional growth from conducting this work.\n\n\nThe second project also involved a researcher who had completed an NSF funded project with a rich dataset. Here the specific challenge centered on conducting SDA on data gathered from marginalized populations, in this case Indigenous engineers. When participants are citizens of sovereign Native nations in the U.S., particular care must be exercised to acknowledge their sovereignty and handle the data in accordance with the laws of that nation. Navigating the approval process of tribal institutional review boards, though, is a necessarily slow and careful process of building trust and relationships; thus SDA offers an appealing avenue towards increasing research output and evidence-based knowledge gathered from such time-intensive work. However, it also creates new ethical and logistical questions that formed the focus of this project. A graduate student from another institution, working under the supervision of his doctoral advisor, used SDA with this data set as a component of his dissertation research. This project offered significant guidelines for conducting SDA with marginalized populations, and engaged deeply with emerging ethical questions such as when to return to participants for further consent and how new data analysis might or might not benefit the participants.\n\n\nTo develop guidelines for the research community based on these mini-projects, we built upon the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse) principles established recently by the scientific community, and further on the CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics) principles for Indigenous data governance, to propose the SHARE principles for qualitative data sharing and secondary analysis:\n\nStewarding collaborative relationships\nHonoring context of data\nAligning questions and data\nResponsibly reusing data\nExpanding capacity and ownership\n\n\n\nDetails on these guidelines have been shared in the open-access journal Studies in Engineering Education, and disseminated through workshops at national and international conferences.
