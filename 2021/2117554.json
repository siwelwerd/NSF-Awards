Funding will support acquisition of an ion chromatograph which allows the determination and quantification of important molecules in natural waters.  The IC would directly benefit ten ongoing projects in geochemistry, chemistry, mine-waste remediation, botany, and environmental science and engineering.   Intended studies of Arsenic and metal remediation at a local Superfund site has implications for public health and environmental recovery.  Planned engagement with a local watershed education Program would expose hundreds of K-12 teachers and their students to geochemical analysis applications to local mining related environmental issues. The instrument will support the research of early career and female geoscientists and research and teaching training at two primarily undergraduate institutions in rural Montana where first generation and Native American students make up a significant part of the student body.\r\n\r\nThe IC will support analysis of major cations, anions and organic acids in aqueous samples.  A particular focus of the PIs research agenda are investigations aimed at understanding how arsenic and metal contaminants cycle in the environment, study of bio-electrochemical methods to reduce nitrates from agricultural runoff, ecosystems remediation, and exploring extremophile mediated biogeochemical interactions in Yellowstone's hot springs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
