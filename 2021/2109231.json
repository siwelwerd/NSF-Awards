 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to advance a key technology known as a \u201cphotonic lantern.\u201d Photonic lanterns will allow for compact and stable spectrographs behind large telescopes. These spectrographs will deliver extremely precise measurements of various astronomical objects, most notably planets around other stars. The work to advance photonic lanterns will proceed in several key ways. First, to understand how to use lanterns to efficiently capture light from a large telescope. Second, to demonstrate that lanterns can sense the shape of light waves after they are affected by Earth\u2019s atmosphere.  This will enable correction for those shape errors and maximize the amount of light captured. Finally, to explore the potential of using a lantern for making images and measuring positions of astronomical objects.  This work will also be directly applicable to telecommunications and free-space optical communications.  Lanterns could play a key role in increasing the data volume and fidelity of data transfer with satellites. \r\n\r\nOperating at the diffraction-limit breaks traditional seeing-limited instrument scaling laws and allows a spectrograph to be the most compact for a given set of specifications. A compact instrument uses optics that are more likely to be manufacturable and of higher quality, is more robust to mechanical deflections, easier to thermally stabilize, and costs less. A Photonic Lantern (PL) allows conversion of a multi-mode fiber input to multiple single-mode fibers, thus enabling greater coupling at the input while maintaining the diffraction-limit into the spectrograph thus maintaining an ultra-stable spectral line-spread function (i.e. the shape does not vary with time or input illumination conditions).  The project seeks to understand how to efficiently inject light into PLs from wavefronts partially corrected by adaptive optics.  Further it will investigate if PLs can be used as focal-plane wavefront sensors, eliminating non-common path and chromatic errors, and boosting system efficiency Finally, the ability to use lanterns to do imaging and astrometry by separating the coherent and incoherent parts of the electric field will be investigated.  The outcomes from this project could have immediate significant impact on existing and future spectrographs on large telescopes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\n \nThe major outcomes of this program have centered on the experimental characterization of photonic lanterns for use in astronomy.  A photonic lantern is a device based on optical fibers that converts a complex beam of incident light into a compact array of stable outputs.  Our efforts have rested on a broad simulation effort to predict their behavior.  The team successfully fabricated several photonic lanterns, and in parallel we developed an experimental platform for testing them by leveraging infrastructure at the Subaru Telescope.  This platform has the ability to feed lanterns with an internal light source that has injected errors (mimicking light from a star that has passed through Earth?s turbulent atmosphere), as well as the ability to feed the lantern with real starlight.  Our lanterns were integrated with this experimental testbed, and we have experimentally characterized the response of these devices to a variety of injected turbulent errors, ultimately testing their ability to couple starlight.  This work has shown that photonic lanterns have advantages over standard fibers for feeding astronomical spectrometers.\nOur work explored the ability of these photonic devices to act as wavefront sensors through theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies.  Ultimately, we have demonstrated an ability to accurately sense injected wavefront errors, proving their ability to correct for aberrations that might result in coupling losses and inefficiency in astronomical spectroscopy.  Moreover, we have demonstrated the real-time feedback control of wavefront errors, showing that the photonic lantern wavefront sensor can be integrated with observatory adaptive optical systems. In addition, the wavefront sensing techniques and architectures developed as part of this project will be directly applicable to telecommunications systems, including free-space laser communications systems such as those to satellites and deep space networks and spacecraft. \nOur team has characterized the variation in lantern response with the wavelength of light.  These properties inform the design of photonic-lantern-based astronomical experiments aimed at several types of measurement.  Our team has also studied these applications, informed by the experimental results.  We have shown that lanterns can enable new forms of spectro-astrometry (which can detect and characterize young forming exoplanets very close to their host stars), coherent imaging (which can distinguish starlight from light scattered by circumstellar dust or emitted by nearby planets), and nulling (which blocks bright starlight so that faint structures can be seen).\nAll of these outcomes have come about with the full integration of student training and professional development.  Throughout this project, students have made the most of these opportunities by spending time in the laboratory, at the telescope, and have given multiple presentations at conferences on the forefront of astronomical research.\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/26/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nemanja Jovanovic"
