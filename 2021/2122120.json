 "awd_abstract_narration": "The labor market participation rate of persons with disabilities (PWD) is significantly lower than persons without disabilities. There are more than one billion PWDs in the world and constitute a source of talent for employment towards the development and offering of products and services. The challenges faced by this population in contributing equally in our society has implications not only to our economies, but also human rights, equality, equity, and diversity. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The workshop is innovative in that it is forward-looking (pre-emptive as opposed to reactionary) in creating a research agenda encompassing various emerging and expected developments in technology in conjunction with human factors, and social and behavioral sciences. In addition, by taking a comprehensive and universal design view, it plans to consider all the major disabilities (vision, hearing, cognitive and intellectual, physical and mobility, and combinations of these. The workshop will focus on developing specific assistive technologies to be designed to integrate PWD in future workforce and the associated education and training initiatives that will be required. The project will be informed by participants that span nonprofits serving PWD, employers of PWD, workforce training institutions, national disability inclusion advocates individuals with disabilities, researchers from academia and industry. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:Societal broader impacts include: 1) development of work tools and technologies (and associated tech transfer), that increases the workforce participation and productivity of people with disabilities and the general population; and 2) creation of a model for other similar future efforts (beyond work) to address disability inclusion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Why is it needed?</strong></p>\n<p>The overarching theme of disability inclusion in workplaces through technology is clearly a use inspired translational research area. This theme is borne out of years of challenges faced by people with disabilities (PWDs) in finding employment and progressing in their careers. Statistics indicate that 61 million adults in the United States (about 26% or 1 in 4 people) live with some kind of disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. However, 71% of working age Americans (aged 16 to 64) with disabilities are unemployed vs. 25% of Americans without disabilities, and these numbers have not changed for several generations.</p>\n<p>In addition, US employers are not and have not been able to adequately tap into the human capital available in persons with disabilities. PWDs as a population are generally not considered in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion efforts. Moreover, even if these employers wanted to hire PWDs, they typically do not have the knowledge and/or means to reach out, recruit, retain and mentor PWDs. By increasing the employment of PWDs, US employers could significantly increase and improve their human capital. Furthermore, striving for higher employment rates for PWDs is fiscally prudent as each employed person will contribute to tax revenue while not needing government support.</p>\n<p>Although significant increases have been observed in the STEM participation of many underrepresented groups, major disparities in related educational attainment and employment patterns remain for PWDs. To effect positive change, a comprehensive and systematic scientific approach is needed to improve awareness and understand the processes that led to this inequity experienced by PWDs. Thus, there is a pressing need for the broader scientific community to work with relevant stakeholders to address the challenge of disability inclusion in the workforce.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the convergent themes and why are they not only convergent but ready for acceleration?</strong></p>\n<p>The three convergent themes are:</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Theme A:</span> Design and Innovation of Assistive Technologies &amp; Access Design of new technologically-based accessibility tools to make foundational employment activities more accessible.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Theme B:</span> Hiring and Workplace Accommodations &amp; Policy/Economics Development of new social and economic-based initiatives directed toward making employment, hiring and workplaces more accessible and more welcoming to people with disabilities.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Theme C</span><strong>:</strong> Training, Workforce Development, and K-16 Education Design of new technologically based accessibility accommodations to make K-16 education more accessible to students with disabilities and design of improved re-training tools and methods.</p>\n<p>These themes necessitate the convergence of multiple stakeholders. The assistive technologies and tools that can be created in an accelerated fashion can make an immediate impact on a population that has historically lacked such interventions to be part of the workforce for the greater benefit of society. Given the many benefits (see below) of disability inclusion in the workplace and the fact that this population has been working towards solutions (but still away) for decades, an accelerated timeline is warranted.</p>\n<p><strong>Who would likely be the stakeholders involved?</strong></p>\n<p>Potential stakeholders involved will likely include partnerships between the following entities:</p>\n<p>PWDs, industry (across industry sectors, various sizes), researchers, advocacy groups, non-profits, non-governmental organizations, communities, educational organizations at all levels (Pre-K, K-12, undergraduate and graduate, postdoctoral), faculty, policy makers, standardization bodies, and practitioners (e.g., social workers, human resources, rehabilitation professionals, occupational therapists).</p>\n<p><strong>How will all this help PWDs, employers, etc. in terms of benefits?</strong></p>\n<p>A diverse workforce that includes PWDs is smart. Diversity facilitates novel and creative thinking and problem solving. It increases the likelihood of innovative solutions, processes, and products. The stigma and misconceptions about the abilities of PWDs together with misunderstood cost/benefit to hiring PWDs have resulted in missed opportunities for hiring qualified employees. These problems of stigma and misconceptions about the abilities of PWDs is compounded for women, persons of color, and people from other underrepresented groups of society who are also members of the disability community. The outcomes from this effort could significantly decrease barriers to entrance into the workforce, sustained and productive employment, and advancement into leadership positions. Having a larger portion of the workforce made up of PWDs, that includes women, minorities and other underrepresented groups with disabilities, will lead to a paradigm shift toward a focus on a person?s abilities, rather than disabilities. Also, it will ensure that outputs are inclusive, addressing needs of various users. Ultimately, accessible solutions will benefit everyone - inclusive and accessible workplaces support innovation and create a feedback loop that further amplifies these efforts. Inclusion and participation of PWDs leads to greater interaction and the design of products, environments, and experiences that are inclusive and accessible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/29/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Vinod&nbsp;Namboodiri</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2122120/2122120_10719525_1649174005704_Wattendees--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2122120/2122120_10719525_1649174005704_Wattendees--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Attending Organizations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2122120/2122120_10719525_1649174005704_Wattendees--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Attending Organizations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Workshop participant organizations</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vinod Namboodiri</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vinod&nbsp;Namboodiri</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Attending Organizations</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2122120/2122120_10719525_1649174095894_Partnerships--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2122120/2122120_10719525_1649174095894_Partnerships--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Partnerships\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2122120/2122120_10719525_1649174095894_Partnerships--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Partnerships\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Potential partnerships that can come about under the theme with some example organizations.There is expected to be a greater role for individuals with disabilities to play towards disability inclusionunder the convergence accelerator framework.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nils Hakansson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vinod&nbsp;Namboodiri</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Partnerships</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2122120/2122120_10719525_1649174304853_EconomicsSlide--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2122120/2122120_10719525_1649174304853_EconomicsSlide--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Economics of Disability Inclusion\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2122120/2122120_10719525_1649174304853_EconomicsSlide--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Economics of Disability Inclusion\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Main points on why disability inclusion in workplaces is also economically smart</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ted Conway</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vinod&nbsp;Namboodiri</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Economics of Disability Inclusion</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
