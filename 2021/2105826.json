 "awd_abstract_narration": "The doctoral dissertation project investigates plant establishment and soil formation in recently deglaciated alpine landscapes. Most mountain glaciers are predicted to disappear by the end of the 21st century, leaving significant ice-free land. People and ecosystems depend on these glaciers, but as the glaciers melt, natural resources (e.g., water and pastures, ecosystems services (e.g., carbon storage), cultural identities, and tourism decline. These new lands, however, offer opportunities to study social and ecological adaptations. This study will show how communities adapt to the loss of glaciers. One experiment will be to study the role of grazing animals in enhancing proglacial landscape formation. The project reinforces partnerships between local communities, governmental entities, NGOs, and researchers working across continents to promote scientific advancements of social and ecological adaptations in proglacial landscapes. \r\n\r\nMelting mountain glaciers are exposing large new land areas and this project investigates how postglacial ecosystems could contribute to indispensable services for local and downstream populations in future glacier-free valleys. This doctoral dissertation project uses plot studies of plant species, soil fertility, and geomorphic surfaces across a range of alpine landscapes where glaciers have melted over the last hundred years. By studying the migration of alpine plant communities to higher elevations and ecosystem formation, the research characterizes the main processes occurring in these ice-free landscapes. The study also combines intensive sampling, UAV (drone) surveys, satellite imagery, and an experiment to test if introducing grazing animals can accelerate ecosystem formation. By applying the same research design in multiple locations, this project provides reproducible data and generalizable knowledge regarding social and ecological adaptations in deglaciating landscapes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This will have significant implications for alpine ecosystems and society both near and downstream of the glaciers, thus affecting much larger areas and human populations beyond the deglaciating landscapes themselves. The project integrated intensive floristic and geomorphologic sampling, multispectral UAV (drone) surveys, and an experimental approach to study novel proglacial ecosystem formation. First, through the overall project, we carried out 620 floristic and geomorphic plot surveys within nine glacier forelands distributed between the Peruvian Tropical Andes and the French and Swiss Alps to study the upward migration of vegetation. In parallel, within the same nine sites, we collected 198 soil samples to study proglacial soil pedogenesis. Second, during the project period, we developed a low-cost, multispectral UAV remote sensing method adapted to proglacial landscapes. In this work, we carried out multispectral drone surveys in the nine glacier forelands studied. Our specific objectives were first to upscale our results for the previous floristic plot sampling carried out at the nine sites, to the overall glacier forelands; and second to enhance proglacial ecosystems mapping and measure ecosystem services (i.e., biomass, slope stability, and biodiversity) for future work. Based on the data collected between May and September 2021 (28,200 aerial images acquired within the nine sites) we built 9 Digital Elevation Models and nine 5-band orthomosaics at very high resolution (between 3 and 4 cm per pixel). Manuscripts are in preparation to map proglacial ecosystems and quantify ecosystem services, which use the results from the 620 previous plot surveys. This work has allowed us to create the building blocks to develop predictive models for how proglacial ecosystems become established and test adaptive strategies for the long-range goals to develop better management and policy. Third, through an Andean camelid experiment set up at the foot of the Uruashraju glacier (~4680 m.a.s.l.) in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru, in 2019, we tested if the presence of llamas (<em>Llama glama</em>) can accelerate ecosystem formation in these recently deglaciated lands. After 3 years, our results showed that the llamas act as soil fertilizer and enhance soil pedogenesis, through an increase in soil organic carbon and soil nitrogen. In addition, via an increase in plant cover and the presence of viable seed species?which were new to the area?in the llama latrines, the llamas have enhanced vegetation succession and ecosystem development within the experiments in recently deglaciated areas. Our results provide scientific support that a native Andean camelid may favor adaptation to glacier retreat and strengthen the conservation and management of novel proglacial ecosystems. Lastly, during the project period, we have continued to monitor our network of soil temperature sensors over the nine sites (~140 data loggers), collecting the data once a year and verifying their correct functioning. To date, the project has produced one peer-reviewed publication, one manuscript (llama experiment) submitted on 2-25-2023, and further papers nearing completion. In addition, this work was presented at 6 conferences, congresses, and seminars, including the Annual Meeting Association of American Geographers, the International Mountain Conference, Innsbruck, Austria, and the INTECOL Congress, Geneva, Switzerland.</p>\n</div><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/28/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ana\u00efs&nbsp;Zimmer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
