 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1: Non-technical description:\r\nGlobal climate warming is increasing the frequency and severity of low oxygen events in marine and freshwater environments worldwide, and these events threaten the health of aquatic ecosystems and the viability of fish populations.  The Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica has historically been a stable, icy-cold, and oxygen-rich environment, but is now warming at an unprecedented rate and faster than all other regions in the Southern hemisphere.  Antarctic fishes have evolved in sub-zero temperatures that have been stable over long periods of time with traits allowing them to thrive in frigid waters, but with diminished resilience to warming temperatures.  Presently little is known about the ability of Antarctic fishes to withstand hypoxic, or low-oxygen, conditions that often accompany warming.  This research will investigate the hypoxia tolerance of four species of Antarctic fishes, including two species of icefishes that lack the oxygen-carrying protein, hemoglobin, which may compromise their ability to oxygenate tissues under hypoxic conditions. The hypoxia tolerance of four Antarctic fish species will be compared to that of a related fish species inhabiting warmer coastal regions of South America.  Physiological and biochemical responses to hypoxia will be evaluated and compared amongst the five species to bolster our predictions of the capacity of Antarctic fishes to cope with a changing environment.  This research will provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral research fellow.  A year-long seminar series hosted by the Aquarium of the Pacific will feature female scientists who work in Antarctica to inspire youth in the greater Los Angeles area to pursue careers in science.\r\n\r\nPart 2: Technical description: \r\nThe overarching hypothesis to be tested in this project is that the long evolution of Antarctic notothenioid fishes in a cold, oxygen-rich environment has reduced their capacity to mount a robust physiological, biochemical, and molecular response to hypoxia compared to related, cold-temperate fish species.  Hypoxia tolerance will be compared among the red-blooded Antarctic notothenioids, Notothenia coriiceps and Notothenia rossii; the hemoglobinless Antarctic icefishes, Chaenocephalus aceratus and Chionodraco rastrospinosus; and the basal, cold-temperate notothenioid, Eleginops maclovinus, a species that has never inhabited waters south of the Polar Front.  The minimum level of oxygen required to sustain maintenance metabolic requirements (O2crit) will be quantified.  Animals will then be exposed to 65% of O2crit for 48 hours, and responses to hypoxia will be evaluated by measuring hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, as well as metabolites in brain, liver, glycolytic and cardiac muscles. Maximal activities of key enzymes of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism will be quantified to assess capacities for synthesizing ATP in hypoxic conditions.  Gill remodeling will be analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy.  The molecular response to hypoxia will be characterized in liver and brains by quantifying levels of the master transcriptional regulator of oxygen homeostasis, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), and hypoxic gene expression will be quantified using RNA-Seq.  Cell cultures will be used to determine if a previously identified insertion mutation in notothenioid HIF-1 affects the ability of HIF-1 to drive gene expression and thus, hypoxia tolerance.  The results of this project will provide the most comprehensive assessment of the hypoxia tolerance of Antarctic fishes to date.  Broader impacts include research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral research associate, with a focus on involving Native Alaskan students in research.  In partnership with the Aquarium of the Pacific, a year-long public seminar series will be held, showcasing the research and careers of 9 women who conduct research in Antarctica.  The goal of the series is to cultivate and empower a community of middle and high school students in the greater Los Angeles area to pursue their interests in science and related fields, and to enhance the public engagement capacities of research scientists so that they may better inspire youth and early career scientists in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
