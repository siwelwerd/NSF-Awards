 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Scientists evaluate biological diversification by studying how organisms are related to one another (phylogeny) and their geographical distributions through time and space (historical biogeography). Although the geographical distributions of extinct species (which are generally known from fossils) can be dissimilar to the distributions of living descendants, most biogeographical inferences are made from living species. The fellow will employ datasets to study the phylogeny and biogeography of Iguania, a diverse, well-known, and globally distributed lizard group. The project will exemplify an integrative biogeographical approach that can be applied to any group of organisms for which genetic data and fossils are available. Additionally, studying the historical distributions of iguanians is important for understanding present distributions and projecting future distributions of those lizards. The fellow will mentor undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds and train those students in the collection of morphological data. Results will be presented via outreach events, conferences, and publications.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to 1) infer phylogenetic relationships and divergence times among iguanian lizards, and 2) estimate a biogeographic history of iguanian lizards in a probabilistic framework. The fellow will collect phylogenomic and morphological data from ~200 living iguanian lizard species, and morphological data from >30 extinct species, leveraging fossils, skeletons, alcohol-preserved specimens, and tissue samples in museum collections. The study will employ a phylogenomic marker set (179 long and rapidly evolving exons) particularly well-suited for inferring the phylogeny of Iguania, and a published phylogenetic matrix of 150 skeletal and soft-tissue morphological characters specifically constructed for the group. Time-calibrated phylogenies of the combined-evidence dataset will be estimated and used in biogeographic analyses, which will infer the ancestral ranges of the various iguanian lizard clades across the ~150 million-year history of Iguania. The study will address whether specific climatic and geologic events can explain geographic range changes in iguanian lizards during the Cretaceous and Cenozoic. The fellow will receive training in next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic processing of genomic datasets. The fellow will create an online module to communicate the biogeographic findings to undergraduate students, including those underrepresented in the biological sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

There are around 2,000 extant species that are key elements of the ecosystems they inhabit, spanning arid deserts, tropical rainforests, and high mountain altiplano. Although iguanians are frequently studied across biological disciplines, the interrelationships of the major iguanian groups are yet unknown. This project addressed the evolutionary relationships, timescale, and historical biogeography of iguanian lizards using newly generated genome-wide sequence data with greatly increased sampling of species (&gt;200) relative to previous studies, and data from the fossil record that had not been previously incorporated into timescale estimates for iguanians. The novel phylogenomic dataset developed during this project incorporates a diversity of loci, including previously used and newly-developed phylogenomic markers, and leverages coding, non-coding, autosomal, and sex-linked markers. In particular, the phylogenomic data and analyses performed here showcase coding regions with high phylogenetic utility for addressing difficult systematic problems, which will be useful for many future projects in tetrapod phylogenomics. Analyses using these new data resolved and provide highly-supported relationships among many of the major iguanian groups, while providing additional insight into discordance between the history of individual genes and the relationships among species that has confounded understanding of the evolutionary history of this group. Additionally, newly incorporated fossils and cutting-edge methods were employed to estimate a rigorous timescale of the evolution of iguanians, demonstrating a Late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic radiation of most major iguanian clades. The paleontological component of this research also resulted in the discovery of the earliest known representative of modern collared and leopard lizards. A major impact of the project was the development of a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) designed to teach California landscape genetics and natural history to undergraduate students in introductory biology classes. The CURE is specifically targeted to provide a research experience to students who may not otherwise acquire research experience in their coursework and is especially suited for students in California. Other impacts included giving public tours of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology and presentations of research (e.g., UC Berkeley Cal Day), research mentorship of one undergraduate student from a historically underrepresented background and who completed a first-authored publication, and the presentation of research at academic conferences and submitted papers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/16/2023<br>\nModified by: Simon&nbsp;G&nbsp;Scarpetta</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
