 "awd_abstract_narration": "Blazars, one of the most extreme objects in the observed local Universe, occur when the jet emitted from a supermassive black hole is aligned in the general direction of the Earth.  An anticipated astrophysical accelerator for cosmic rays at the highest energies, very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays are observed coincident with these objects and provide a means to study the underlying processes.  This award supports scientists at the California State University - East Bay (CSUEB) to utilize observations of VHE gamma-rays with the VERITAS telescope, located south of Tucson, Arizona, to study the behavior of the most energetic galaxies within the local Universe.  The program provides the opportunity for hands-on experience in leading particle astrophysics research for undergraduates at CSUEB.  Using gamma-ray observations of extremely energetic galaxies, the students will study the different processes that can occur to high energy photons as they travel from the galaxy to the Earth and apply what they learn to the large-scale structure of the Universe between Earth and the energetic galaxy.  Relatedly, the program will advance target-of-opportunity real-time follow-ups of astrophysical events of interest for current and future VHE gamma-ray observatories. \r\n\r\nVery high energy photons and ultra-high-energy cosmic-rays (Energy > 1 PeV) ejected by a blazar have the potential to initiate a cascade process as they traverse the extragalactic distance from source to observer. Due to these interactions, the observed gamma-ray flux is not strictly that which is emitted at the source. Instead, the observed flux may be a combination of the absorbed intrinsic gamma-ray flux (primary emission) and the up-scattered gamma-rays that result from the cascade process along the extragalactic path (secondary emission). The portion of the gamma-ray flux resulting from cascade emission which continues to travel along the original line of sight depends on the magnitude of the intergalactic magnetic field. The proposed astrophysical mechanisms for generating large-scale magnetic fields predict little magnetic flux inside regions of lower integrated mass density, also known as voids.  Studying the location of gamma-ray emitting galaxies with respect to cosmic voids can provide insight on the strength of the magnetic field inside of voids. This project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe general goal of the project was to understand gamma ray photons which originate from outside the Milky Way galaxy. A holistic view of the photon is considered, from its origin (how they were made within other galaxies), its propagation (interactions with fields within the Universe along their travel to Earth) and how the photon is detected and studied (instrumental data collection of gamma-rays from the ground). In working toward the goal to understand the extremely energetic photons, this project enabled the PI to mentor undergraduate students in the collection of gamma-ray data using VERITAS, an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope located south of Tucson, Arizona, the development of software which will allow the study of gamma-rays which are indirectly detected from the ground with the next generation of gamma-ray telescope, and the investigation of how the distribution of gamma-ray galaxies compare to other, non-gamma-ray emitting galaxies. These projects were carried out by physics, computer science and computer engineering undergraduate students from California State University East Bay.\n\n\nThe work involved the continued collection of VERITAS data on gamma-ray galaxies, motivated by the uncertainty that surrounds where and how this gamma-ray light is made in these extreme objects. Gamma-ray emitting galaxies are some of the most energetic sources in the universe. The data was analyzed and cmpared against X-ray data from the Swift X-ray telescope in the same time period, allowing insight into the acceleration mechanisms which get charged particles up to sufficiently high energies to produce gamma-ray photons. The gamma-ray light from these sources can be affected by light and magnetic fields that reside between Earth and these sources. The amount of this interaction, and how it affects the gamma-ray photons which travel from the galaxies to Earth was a topic of additional work supported under this grant.\n\n\nThe detailed investigation of the line of sight to galaxies was completed through the parameterization of what is referred to as the voidiness of galaxies. The voidiness is a fractional measure of how much of a line of sight intersects with a large underdense volume of the Universe, referred to as a void. This parameter can be used as a rough proxy for the density of baryonic matter along the path to the galaxies. Evidence that gamma-ray galaxies appear to be detected along lines of sight with an overall lower fraction of void intersection was found, motivating additional studies on what type of gamma-ray interactions might lead to such a result.\n\n\nAs the next generation of gamma-ray emitting telescope is being constructed, the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), it is imperative to understand how new technology such as more powerful computing power and upgraded photodetection devices might lead to more sensitive instruments. Undergraduate computer science and engineering majors took on the development of simulation tool which could create a mock datastream for use in the characterization of a camera which will be mounted on a new type of telescope known as the prototype Schwarzchild-Couder telescope. With this simulation tool, the impact of an extremely high datarate and the IO bandwidth of the hardware could be tested while the camera was not mounted to the telescope structure.\n\n\nA significant impact of the proposal was that all projects outlined above were led by undergraduate students, who were able to share their results with the public, and partake in peer-peer mentorship through the high impact teaching practice of hands-on learning. The PI was also supported in their role as Deputy Spokesperson and Spokesperson of VERITAS, where they endeavored to improve the climate of the large science collaboration of VERITAS and move the collaboration into the next stage of gamma-ray astrophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AmyKFurniss\n"
