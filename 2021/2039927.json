 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cumulative environmental change is negatively impacting the sustainability of coastal communities. Archaeology provides a deep-time perspective into the impacts of climate change on human populations, as our species has coped with varying degrees of environmental change for most of our existence. This project seeks to investigate the relationship between settlement choice and environmental conditions in coastal foraging populations over the last 4000 years. This project will provide important insight into the interlinked social and environmental factors that affect settlement choices. By investigating community settlement choice in an area known for its extreme environmental conditions, we can better understand variability in human responses to environmental change. Clarifying the connection between human behavior and environmental change is vital, as environmental change impacts on livelihoods are intensifying. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, the methods proposed here will also assist communities in conserving their cultural heritage by systematically recording human activities on the landscape through time.\r\n\r\nThree main questions are posed by this project: 1) How important are natural resources in human settlement choice? 2) Are major climate events accompanied by shifts in the distribution and density of settlements? and 3) Do social factors, such as community ties or networks, influence settlement patterns, and if so, to what degree? Using an automated remote sensing procedure, this project will systematically record archaeological deposits in this coastal foraging community and researchers will survey and excavate identified locations to establish site chronologies. Next, environmental conditions over the past several thousand years will be reconstructed using fossilized corals. Finally, these data will be incorporated into spatial statistical models to analyze the relationship between environmental conditions and settlement distributions over time. The project would advance archaeological knowledge about human-environment interactions, and the role of mobility in human adaptations to environmental change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This is especially pronounced in many coastal areas where sustainability of fisheries and fragile marine ecosystems is under severe strain. The deep-time perspective offered by archaeology provides one means by which to assess the impacts of climatic and environmental change on human communities, as our species has learned to cope with a variety of extreme conditions throughout the world for hundreds-of-thousands of years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The results of this dissertation project have greatly expanded our understanding of the drivers and long-term impacts of settlement behavior on Madagascar over the past millennium. The analysis of satellite imagery, guided by machine learning and statistical methods, have allowed for a rapid assessment of the island's southwest coast. This has resulted in the documentation of hundreds of new archaeological sites. This new archaeological data provides insight to the driving forces behind human decision making in this region for the last several millennia. Based on this research, we know that social connectivity and community defense were significant contributing factors to the decision of Malagasy communities on where to situate themselves on the landscape. Environmental and climatic contexts, like resource availability and precipitation levels, were also highly influential in people's mobility or settlement decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project also generated evidence that Malagasy foragers in the Velondriake region developed social organizational networks that were resilient to a slew of environmental and sociopolitical shifts over the past millennium. As such, settlement and mobility strategies among coastal communities has served as an adaptive mechanism to risk posed by climate change, resource availability, and political violence for at least the past 1000 years. This holds important implications for future efforts towards sustainability and resilience in the face of increasing climate related impacts to coastal communities on Madagascar and elsewhere. By integrating traditional methods of mobility-based livelihood strategies into conservation policies, resource use can be better managed in ways that aid biodiversity efforts while minimizing the impact to Malagasy communities who rely on these resources for survival.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to improving our understanding of ancient decision making, this project work has also helped to document the long-lasting and significant impact that ancient foraging populations have made on Madagascar's landscape. Ancient communities altered the vegetation and soil properties throughout much of the study region, which resulted in an increased ability for soil and taxa to retain water in places where people have actively lived for the past several hundred to several thousand years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Excavations carried out as part of this dissertation uncovered several open-air village sites from the northern, central, and southernmost reaches of the Velondriake area in southwest Madagascar. Charcoal and faunal materials recovered from these sites reveal an extensive use of trees as fuel sources for cooking, marine resource exploitation, and the use of tubers, cacti, and shrubs in dietary contexts. The presence of starvation foods at some excavated areas signifies potential periods of environmental downturn, and these occupations overlap with climatic shifts from very wet conditions (ca. 550 - 450 cal. BP) towards drought conditions (ca. 450 - 300 cal. BP).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Excavations also provided the first and only evidence, to date, of stone-tool use in the southwest of Madagascar. A lithic blade recovered from the bottom of one of our excavations likely constitutes an early presence of foragers in the Velondriake region as early as 728 - 1235 years ago. This discovery is especially significant in light of the ongoing debate over when and where humans first arrived on Madagascar. The presence of stone tool use in the southwest adds to an ever-increasing collection of evidence of sustained human occupancy on the island for the past several thousand years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The findings of this work were shared with local Malagasy communities via a series of public lectures, translated summaries of project findings, and digital models that can be used to plan and conduct archaeological surveys in southwest Madagascar. All work conducted in this project was accomplished in direct collaboration with local communities and local archaeologists, and all findings have been shared in international scientific conferences in addition to peer reviewed scientific publications.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/20/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dylan&nbsp;S&nbsp;Davis</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2039927/2039927_10716288_1657216566057_Map_NSF--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2039927/2039927_10716288_1657216566057_Map_NSF--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Map of study region and the initial survey and excavation areas\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2039927/2039927_10716288_1657216566057_Map_NSF--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Map of study region and the initial survey and excavation areas\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Inset map shows location of study area on Madagascar.
