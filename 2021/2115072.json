 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent scientific studies have begun to disentangle the complex relationship between Arctic warming and the increased frequency of extreme weather events. Several mechanisms for this linkage have been hypothesized, and recent studies reveal that different mechanisms can vary by season and region. This research advances our knowledge of trends in past and future extreme weather events during winter and summer over northern hemisphere continents, and the role of rapid Arctic warming in contributing to changes in the frequency and persistence of those events. The realism of climate models in capturing these relationships are assessed, and results aid in improving model simulations. Increased frequency of extreme weather is already directly affecting millions, if not billions, of people across the globe. The results from this research project are valuable to planners, business leaders, and decision-makers in preparing for future increases in extreme weather events.\r\n\r\nThis study builds upon previous work related to Arctic variability and statistical associations with extreme winter weather events in which observational datasets were used to establish a link between episodes of Arctic warm anomalies and severe winter weather at locations in eastern North America. The research team expands this methodology to, 1) gridded data sets from reanalysis and climate model simulations, allowing exploration of relationships across all northern hemisphere midlatitude areas, 2) both winter and summer seasons, and 3) historical and future projections. The study will greatly expand our knowledge of statistical associations between amplified Arctic warming (AAW) to extreme summer and winter weather conditions that will inform ongoing studies of linkage mechanisms. This research specifically answers questions related to validation, variability, past and future evolution, attribution, realism of historical model simulations, and persistence. A better understanding and more accurate prediction of changes in the frequency, location, and severity of weather extremes are urgently needed by decision-makers at all levels of society. Results from this study inform and enhance various modes of outreach, provide valuable and actionable information to decision-makers, and create new data sets of extreme weather indices that can be incorporated into studies by other investigators.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nSince the 1990s, Arctic winter temperatures have shown an amplified warming trend referred to as Arctic amplification (AA). AA is strongest over the Arctic Ocean during the fall and winter seasons, while during the summer it is weaker and shifted over land. Over the same period, interior North America, Northern Europe and Northern Asia, land temperatures in winter actually cooled from 19902013 followed by more variable winters. The recent mid-latitude winter cooling period has coincided with an increase in severe winter weather events as shown in an earlier study.\n\n\nThe accelerated warming of the Arctic coupled with cooling or lack of warming in the mid-latitudes has resulted in a vigorous debate of whether AA and mid-latitude winter temperature cooling or muted trends coincidently or physically related. The pattern of a warm Arctic and cold continents (WACC) is the strongest observational evidence that some unaccounted-for mechanism has been offsetting greenhouse gas-forced warming over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid-latitudes though the support from global climate models is mixed or even contrary that AA can force mid-latitude cooling.\n\n\nIn our initial observational study published in Cohen et al. 2018, we wanted to explore how strong is the relationship between a warm or cold Arctic and severe winter weather, not just extreme cold but also heavy snowfall in the US. In this new study we extended the AWSSI from the US only to global by computing the same metrics using ERA5 reanalysis, which is an approximation of observational gridded data for the entire globe. We refer to this new global metric of severe winter weather derived from reanalysis as rAWSSI.\n\n\nWe found that the same strong, quasi-linear relationship between Arctic geopotential heights (a measure of atmospheric pressure) and severe winter weather in our initial study existed not only for the Northeastern US but also for Northeastern Europe, especially Scandinavia, and Northern Asia with the new rAWSSI gridded data and for a longer period of analysis.

However, in the mid- to late-winter when Arctic warming extends into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere and the polar vortex weakens, there are at least periods when severe winter weather is increasing in the period of AA. Though as we also show since 1950, severe winter weather is decreasing across all of the Northern Hemisphere, more strongly over the Arctic Ocean.\n\n\nWhether AA is contributing to more severe winter weather periodically and/or regionally across the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere continues to be vigorously debated.
