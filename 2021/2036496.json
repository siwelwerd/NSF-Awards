 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will significantly improve the way clinicians and researchers measure, study and treat pain.  Chronic pain affects 20% of U.S. adults and costs $600 billion annually. Opioids are often the first treatment option offered to patients with chronic pain. Currently pain is assessed using simplistic, subjective and generalized visual/verbal scales (1-10) with little ability to localize the origin. It is essential for clinicians and medical researchers to have calibrated and accurate measures of pain to assist patients in determining the underlying disease and directing patients to the most effective therapies. This project will develop a new biomedical tool to quantify pain data for multimodal treatment plans to potentially minimize opioid use. This tool will improve quality of life for people suffering from chronic pain and help those on opioids find better therapies. Furthermore, it will help clinicians with varied levels of training and experience achieve the highest level of exam skill.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will digitize a physical exam by capturing palpation location and pressure and patient pain expression via multiple biosensors to create a personalized \u201ccontour\u201d map of pain intensity onto a 3D image of the human body. This comprehensive and calibrated data set can then be used to assist clinicians in developing a more accurate differential diagnosis for the underlying pain condition. This project will advance the hardware and software components for future integration with augmented reality and artificial intelligence modules.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

PainScan engenders a collaborative process between doctor and patient with both participants working together during a physical exam.

Prior to this funded work there were no known methods to automatically track clinician touch and reproduce it on a&nbsp;3D digital twin&nbsp;of the patient.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our team outlined ambitious R&amp;D goals for this NSF SBIR Phase I Award. Many technical, business and customer discovery milestones were accomplished. The NSF Phase I investment helped show that the core technical risk of mapping clinician touch onto a digital twin of the patient is attainable. The accuracy of our version 1 system is not yet sufficient for clinical use, but the prototype developed is a compelling proof of concept for digitizing the medical physical exam.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The benefits of PainScan include personal precise 3D pain assessment, longitudinal calibrated pain tracking, and comparison of pain patterns across large groups of people to improve diagnostic categories and find effective therapies. PainScan is the evolutionary next step in pain assessment technology, providing a comprehensive, modern software platform and human body database that will be adapted over time to include multiple pain biosensors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With further investment, the system will be improved to a level of accuracy that offers clinicians, patients, and researchers the ability to confidently capture and document a holistic and comprehensive view of the full pain picture.
