 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to investigate socioeconomic variation in the impacts of culture contact, focusing specifically on conquest and colonization. Archaeologically, material culture provides a perspective that allows researchers to observe how people in the past coped with external stresses when facing broader sociopolitical changes. Previous research has argued that Quality of Life (QOL) embedded in inequality is a factor in how households incorporate or reject material elements from new traditions after culture contact. Their project will focus on ceramic hybridity, a common phenomenon in colonial societies where potters incorporate foreign cultural elements into the traditional ceramic production sequence. The project will contribute to the anthropological understanding of culture contact demonstrating that a great amount of cultural continuity is commonly overlooked when studying processes of conquest; and it will contribute to the methodological issue of identifying the agency of underrepresented groups in the past who did not leave their mark in the written records, usually created by colonizers. The project will demonstrate how inequality interacts with changes brought by colonization such as land use, forced labor, and health among unequal households, thus serving as an example to shed light on how inequality interacts with how people cope with catastrophes in the present. How are we different from populations who experienced epidemics in the past? What were the unfair circumstances that made it more difficult for unequal households back then? What can we learn?\r\n\r\nThe project will investigate cultural continuity of indigenous populations between the prehispanic and colonial eras. It will consider how unequal QOL impacted the ways in which households incorporated elements of European and African styles. It is argued that strongly negative impacts of colonization on QOL, as in populations that labored at sugar plantations, encouraged continuity in material culture to reaffirm indigenous identity. Populations that were not as negatively affected are therefore expected to have adopted a wider range of foreign styles. The project will use household inventories to assess the impacts of colonization from an archaeological perspective of QOL of indigenous communities at various points in time. The project will include members of the local communities, both in fieldwork and in the dissemination of the knowledge produced, also contributing to education working with archaeology students. This research will result in a more nuanced understanding of localized experiences when facing broad scale stress.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project focuses on the moment of Spanish arrival and conquest, when the Aztec empire already demanded tribute from the indigenous communities that inhabited the region. Conqueror Hernan Cortes chose this region for the construction of the first sugar mill on the North American continent, in an enormous grant of land in the present-day states of Veracruz and Oaxaca, which he named the \"Marquesado del Valle\" for his new title of \"Marques\". Arrival of a new empire signified changes in the indigenous lifestyle; introducing slavery, religious impositions, and other culturally significant structures. However, the historical records rarely tell the story from the indigenous point of view. Records are usually written by those in power, and rarely portray the lives of the rural workers that made colonial New Spain (and independent Mexico) possible. How did indigenous quality of life change after Spanish conquest? Did they freely incorporate elements of European and/or African style in their production of ceramics, textiles, and other artifacts? What aspects of the indigenous production of these materials remained after conquest?</p>\n<p>At each site, we performed topographic mapping, auger tests and excavations to investigate domestic contexts, as these are the best unit of analysis to observe people's quality of life. From these excavations, we recovered ceramics, stone and obsidian artifacts, and other evidence of the domestic life that spans beyond the time periods proposed, stretching continuously fom modern times over three millenia back to the Olmec culture. &nbsp;We obtained information not only on the transition between the indigenous and the colonial eras, but on the changes and continuities that people endured before, in events such as the integration to the Aztec empire. The houses that we excavated have been used for centuries, thus speaking of a resistance that entails the adherence to a place. This project provides a new perspective on colonization processes, specifically in a Mexican province where little research had been done on the topic. Archaeologically, ceramics and other materials obtained in excavation contributed to the anthropological understanding of culture contact, observing more nuanced elements of change and continuity.</p>\n<p>In Mexican archaeology, historical materials are not usually understood as an important part of the prehispanic communities that survived contact, as most of the archaeological research focuses on the prehispanic periods. This is part of a perception of the colonial era as a period to be analyzed by a different discipline. This project<strong> </strong>contributes to Gulf Coast historical archaeology by demonstrating that cultural continuity is commonly overlooked when studying colonization. Native populations constructed the present-day country of Mexico, in close contact with African communities whose influences have not been widely studied in the region's archaeology. Lastly, in the archaeology of the Gulf Coast of Mexico, we find that community approaches are limited because present-day residents of those geographic locations do not identify as direct descendants of prehispanic groups, but rather migrated into the area after the Mexican revolution or self-identify simply as \"Mexicans\". These groups of people, on the other hand, interact with archaeological heritage daily, and have created new networks of meaning around it. Working closely with the communities in recovering their historical connection to the archaeological past, this project has intended to alter the sense of distance people have toward their cultural heritage through the idea that archaeological sites did not disappear after conquest but were the scenes of new forms of identity and of the cultural configurations of the present day.</p>\n<p>The project involved Mexican archaeologists, Mexican undergraduates, and local workers; whose points of view added significantly to the research. Results obtained from the NSF funded fieldwork are an example of how place and memory are in the center of this region's cultural landscape and have helped us start visualizing what life looked like for agricultural workers in the past.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/08/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gabriela&nbsp;Montero Mejia</p>\n</div>\n<div
