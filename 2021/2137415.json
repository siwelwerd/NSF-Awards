 "awd_abstract_narration": "The timing of life history events (e.g. timing of migration, reproduction, hibernation), collectively known as phenology, remains poorly understood in the wild. Ecologists have been challenged in their ability to explain current phenological patterns, as well as predict how such patterns may change as our global climate continues to warm. Recent advances in molecular ecology, physiology, and demography, coupled with the cumulation of long-term, individual-based studies of animals in the wild, will considerably improve our collective understanding of phenological shifts within the context of climate change. By bringing together researchers focused on different hierarchical levels of organization (from genes and molecules to organisms, populations and communities) and different taxonomic groups, we hope to stimulate inter-disciplinary discussion and collaboration within this emerging field. The symposium provides opportunities for early career scientists such as undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, assistant professors, and junior research scientists. Recognizing the importance of diverse perspectives, our speaker line-up brings in balanced gender representation and includes contributors from underrepresented groups. All speakers in the main symposium will be contributing a manuscript for publication in a special issue in the journal Integrative and Comparative Biology, the flagship journal of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology. In addition to publication of the results in ICB, we will broadly advertise and disseminate findings of the symposium via social media. \r\n\r\nSeasonal variation in the availability of essential resources is one of the most important drivers of natural selection on the phasing and duration of annually recurring life-cycle events. Shifts in seasonal timing are among the most commonly reported responses to climate change and the capacity of organisms to adjust their seasonal timing, either through phenotypic plasticity or microevolution, is a critical component of resilience. Despite growing interest in documenting and forecasting the impact of climate change on phenology, our ability to predict how individuals, populations, and species might respond in their timing of reproduction to changes in their environment is constrained by our limited knowledge regarding 1) the cues animals use to adjust timing, 2) the endogenous genetic and molecular mechanisms that transduce cues into neural and endocrine signals, and 3) the inherent capacity of animals to alter their timing and phasing within annual cycles. By bringing together researchers focused on different hierarchical levels of organization (from genes to organisms, populations and communities) and different taxonomic groups, we hope to stimulate inter-disciplinary collaborations around these themes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
