 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative effort will contribute to the interagency-supported Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) program, that includes the NSF-funded Sustainably Navigating Arctic Pollution Through Engaging Communities (SNAP-TEC) project. This project focuses on chemical mechanisms for the conversion of sulfur dioxide to particulate sulfate under the cold, low-light conditions in Fairbanks Alaska. This research also will investigate the ability of snow chemistry to affect air quality. The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of the chemical mechanisms for forming air pollution in northerly regions, such as in Fairbanks. \r\n\r\nThe following two hypotheses will be examined through a combination of field, laboratory, and modeling studies: (1) Brown carbon drives the oxidation of S(IV) to particle sulfate through reactions involving BrC-derived triplet excited states (3C*) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); and (2) The persistent winter snowpack has a significant influence on the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere (e.g., through release of HONO), as well as on the processing of sulfur and nitrogen. \r\n\r\nOne of the broader impacts of this research includes the development of science modules for local middle school students. The modules will be made freely available to teachers, homeschooling parents, and self-guided students. For the homeschooling audience, the PIs plan to supplement the activities with projects that utilize data from air monitoring networks that leverage active-learning principles. The homeschooling sub-focus is particularly important for Alaska Native and American Indian populations, who rely on homeschooling much more than other groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis collaborative project was a part of the Alaskan Layered Pollution And Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) field experiment, which was a large international collaboration involving nearly fifty field researchers and dozens more who have been analyzing the data. The ALPACA study investigated wintertime air pollution emissions and chemistry outdoors in the cold and dark, how that pollution seeps into houses and how indoor sources affect indoor air quality and had a strong community engagement component including social science research into public preferences regarding the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual merits: Our collaborative project, which was funded by this grant, aimed to improve understanding of chemical process of nitrogen and sulfur that contribute to fine particulate matter. Before the work, it was thought that the cold and dark conditions would suppress production of chemical oxidants that are normally produced mostly by daytime photochemistry. We found that although about 62% of sulfate in fine particulate matter is directly emitted there is a significant contribution from oxidation of sulfur dioxide by oxidants formed through novel processes related to the cold climate and photochemistry even during the darkest part of winter. Another critical aspect of understanding pollution in cold and dark climates is the need to understand trapping of pollution by temperature inversions, which are common in snow covered basins when the day length and insolation is short. Temperature inversions trap colder air near the surface hindering mixing with warmer less-dense air higher aloft. Friction of the air moving over the rough terrain then slows horizontal wind speeds reducing horizontal export in addition to limiting vertical export of pollution. In this project we investigated the strength of the temperature inversion and its relationship to the vertical distribution of SO2 that was primarily emitted from home heating using sulfur-containing heating oil. We found that during strong temperature inversions SO2 was trapped in a layer between 20 and 50 meters thick. We further developed the platform for atmospheric chemistry and transport in one dimension (PACT-1D) model by adding a parameterization for the pollution layer height as a function of the measured near-surface temperature gradient. The model had very high skill (Pearson's R = 0.88) and indicates that the residence time of pollution in downtown Fairbanks has a median of 2.1 hours under temperature-inverted conditions. The model is being further developed to add snowpack chemical processes and mix air into the porous snowpack so as to understand the role of snow in Fairbanks pollution processes. The snowpack model development is also using in-field measurements of light penetration depth into the snowpack, temperature profiles within the snowpack, and depth profiles of snow chemical composition to drive and/or verify the model. The model is also being used to quantify contributions of the unique chemical processes discovered in ALPACA to improve understanding of their impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nBroader impacts: These field and modeling results are being provided to regulators in the Environmental Protection Agency and Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation to support development of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) that aims to achieve compliance with the fine particulate pollution standard set by the clean air act. Our team has communicated the results with the local community through meetings and articles published in the local newspaper, as described in the overview paper of the ALPACA-2022 field study. Although the study focused on Fairbanks, Alaska, the work has wide implications for cold climate locations across the Arctic, sub-Arctic, and in mountain basin cities.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/06/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: WilliamRSimpson\n"
