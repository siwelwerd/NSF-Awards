 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021,\r\nIntegrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes,\r\nEnvironment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that\r\nwill contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. The fellow will conduct research\r\nfocusing on polygenic traits, which are defined as the physical characteristics, or phenotypes, of\r\nan organism that are influenced by many genes located throughout an individual\u2019s genome.\r\nExamples of polygenic traits include numerous human diseases and the resilience of coral reefs\r\nto global climate change. The fellow will conduct experiments to understand: (1) how genetic\r\ndifferences between individuals give rise to differences in the physical expression of polygenic\r\ntraits and (2) how polygenic traits evolve in natural populations. Through this, the fellow largely\r\naims to lend insight into the extent to which genetic information can be used to accurately predict\r\nan individual\u2019s phenotype. Throughout the duration of this fellowship, the fellow will engage in\r\noutreach efforts that specifically aim to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in\r\nevolutionary biology.\r\n\r\nTo resolve the genetic basis and evolutionary dynamics of polygenic traits, the fellow\r\nwill study populations of Drosophila melanogaster as they rapidly evolve in response to seasonal\r\nfluctuations in the environment. This system provides a lens to directly observe evolution and\r\nselection, both on individual genes and specific polygenic traits throughout the course of\r\nadaptation. This work will focus on three polygenic traits in D. melanogaster with demonstrated\r\necological relevance in natural populations. The first aim of the fellow\u2019s research will involve\r\nmapping the genetic basis of each trait as it rapidly evolves between seasons. Through this, the\r\nfellow aims to determine whether the genotype-to-phenotype map is stable during evolution, or\r\nwhether the genetic basis of polygenic traits is altered by the evolutionary process. The second\r\naim will leverage these results, in combination with 7 years of existing data, to explore the extent to\r\nwhich those genetic polymorphisms that underpin the phenotypic variation of a polygenic trait\r\nare the same as those that respond to natural selection and drive the evolution of the trait through\r\ntime. The fellow will further gain extensive formal and informal training in preparation for a\r\ncareer of academic research and teaching.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
