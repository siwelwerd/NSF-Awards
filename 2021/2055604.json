 "awd_abstract_narration": "The world one lives in is geometric in nature where numerous everyday-life issues, as well as \r\nfundamental scientific mysteries, can be expressed in geometric terms. For instance, the study of \r\nphysical laws has led to the development of a refined mathematical framework where elaborate \r\ngeometric structures are able to depict and model the interactions of elementary particles and the \r\nsymmetries underlying quantum physics. Another example comes from networks, which are ubiquitous in modern society. From the \r\nWorld Wide Web and its powerful search engines to social networks, from telecommunication networks \r\nto economic systems, networks represent a wide range of real world systems. A network can naturally \r\nbe seen as a geometric object by considering the number of edges of the shortest path connecting two \r\nnodes in the network as a quantity measuring their proximity. The shortest path distance on a graph is a \r\nfundamental example of an abstract mathematical object called \"metric\". The notion of a metric space is \r\nan overarching concept that is pivotal in mathematical models of optimization problems in networks, \r\nand in a vast range of application areas, including computer vision, computational biology, machine \r\nlearning, statistics, and mathematical psychology, to name a few. This extremely useful abstract concept \r\ngeneralizes the classical notion of a Euclidean space, where the distance from point A to point B is \r\ncomputed as the length of a straight line connecting them. In numerous practical problems, \r\nthe heart of the matter boils down to understanding whether we can find a\r\nrepresentation of a given metric space, in particular a graph equipped with its shortest path distance, \r\ninside some other geometric object that we understand much better and that carries \r\nadditional structure. Our ability to perform such a task in a \r\nquantitatively efficient way has tremendous applications. The project will provide opportunities for \r\nundergraduate students to develop a global mindset and superior communication skills, and graduate \r\nstudents to acquire the algorithmic and programming skills that are crucially needed in the modern \r\nworkplace. \r\n\r\nIn this project, the PI proposes to implement in several instances the geometric approach, which is a \r\nstrategy that consists in understanding and solving problems of seemingly non-geometric nature via the \r\nuncovering of a hidden metric structure that allows the application of a wealth of powerful metric \r\ntechniques. Due to its versatility, the geometric approach has permeated virtually all fields of \r\nmathematics. Creating datasets with billions of entries has become a routine and ubiquitous task. \r\nOptimization, search, and data mining problems on these huge datasets are computationally extremely \r\nhard to solve. Graphs are natural mathematical models for many datasets, and a central computer \r\nscience task is the design of efficient and fast approximation algorithms for optimization and search \r\nproblems on various graphs. A graph is a combinatorial object of seemingly non-geometric nature. \r\nHowever, once equipped with a shortest path metric a graph becomes a metric space and the collection \r\nof all metrics supported on the graph carries geometric information that can be used to understand and \r\nstudy the combinatorial structure of the graph. After its rise in the mid-90's, there are by now numerous \r\nsituations where availing to geometric embeddings of graphs, most notably embeddings into tree-\r\nmetrics or into the classical Lebesgue sequence spaces, provides elegant, very often optimal, and on \r\nsome occasions the only approximation algorithms for computationally intractable problems.  The first \r\ngoal of this proposal is to advance significantly our understanding of the general problem of \r\nembeddability of finite metrics. In particular, we will investigate the connection between \r\nlamplighter metrics and Wasserstein metrics from an algorithmic perspective, and the geometry of thin \r\nLaakso structures in relation to the Metric Kadec-Pelczynski Problem. The second goal, which is \r\nmotivated by the geometric approach to the Novikov conjecture in topology and to Gromov's positive \r\nscalar curvature conjecture in Riemannian geometry, is to advance significantly our understanding of the \r\ncoarse geometry of Banach spaces and the asymptotic behavior of Banach spaces, most notably the \r\nrelationship between concentration inequalities on non-locally finite graphs and the Szlenk index.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
