 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve outcomes of medical endoscopy procedures through 3D imaging where only two-dimensional images were previously obtained.  3D imaging can reduce costs through improved and earlier detection of cancer and other disorders.  The proposed technology can also impact other specialties, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, where quantifiable depth imaging can have a profound impact. Additional opportunities for the proposed camera exist in mobile, consumer devices, and in-cabin automotive monitoring.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop technology for a compact, single camera 3D imaging system integrated with endoscopes to capture both high-resolution color images and measurable depth information. Current 3D imaging in minimally invasive procedures, captured by stereo cameras, is limited to laparoscopy using multiple trocars to perform surgery. The stereo cameras take an entire trocar by virtue of the space needed for the two cameras. Stereo imaging is not translatable to endoscopy, which houses all instruments inside a single tube. This new 3D imaging system works by integrating an optimized lens modification and back-end neural network to extract three-dimensional information from the imaged area. Because the proposed modification integrates within the single camera module, it can scale with size, enabling three-dimensional imaging capabilities in smaller endoscopes (e.g., for use in gastrointestinal tract, urology, or gynecology) where instrument sizes are constrained. This project will: (1) develop new algorithms to improve high resolution imaging and accuracy, (2) optimize for real-time performance, (3) miniaturize the imaging system toward endoscopy, (4) design a visualization system for the clinical workflow, and (5) validate the system for tissue imaging.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
