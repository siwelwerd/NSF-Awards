 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) award will serve to increase our understanding of snowmelt-induced landslides in cold regions and their changes over time, with a focus on the December 2020 landslide event in Haines, Alaska.  This landslide occurred following an extreme weather event that set records for rainfall and rapidly melted 24 inches of snow.  More extreme events should be expected with a warming climate, including greater and higher intensity precipitation, and more rain instead of snow during certain times of the year.  Through rapid data collection, we will document the extreme nature of the event, including amount and duration of rainfall and their effects on the mass movement, and subsequent reactivation with spring snowmelt.  Capturing perishable data from the Haines landslide will help to understand its origin, motion, and location relative to residential structures.  Results from this study will contribute to landslide detection, hazard mapping, modeling, and risk analysis, all of which are essential in community planning and adapting for long-term resilience while accounting for an increase in extreme weather events.\r\n\r\nThe primary objectives of this RAPID project are to understand why this particular slope failed during this record-breaking event, how it will respond to spring snowmelt, and how its surface will evolve with time. The research team will accomplish these objectives by collecting perishable field data; comparing digital elevation models of the landslide surface from multiple epochs; correlating timing of changes in landslide morphology to rainfall, freezing, snowmelt, and groundwater; and using historic and baseline data for long-term change detection analysis and landslide mapping.  Field data efforts will include: 1) collecting repeat aerial Light Detection and Ranging data and high-resolution images of the landslide surface, 2) characterizing the geology of the slide area, 3) capturing the emergency response, repair, and rebuilding efforts of the community, and 4) collecting local environmental data for analysis.  This landslide represents a unique opportunity to investigate the snowmelt-induced rockfall trigger that potentially initiated the destructive debris flow.  Analysis of repeated data collections will provide understanding of:   how landslide surfaces evolve and how their risk changes with time, especially for events in cold-weather settings for which there is little data; and the timing of community and infrastructure recovery, which will contribute to our understanding of geohazard interaction with the built environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We also conducted on-the-ground mapping of geomorphic features and discontinuities on and around the landslide, and collected soil and rock samples to obtain their strength and engineering properties.\n\n\nWhen first proposing this work, we focused solely on the devastating Beach Road landslide (BRLS), which took the lives of two people. It was not until visiting the community and talking with residents that we understood the tremendous impact the 2020 weather event had on the greater Haines area. Realizing the wider scope, our team collected additional data to describe more of the landslides in the Haines area.\n\n\nThe BRLS represented a unique opportunity to investigate a debris avalanche that transitioned into a debris flow, which was triggered by an atmospheric river with record-breaking rainfall and snowmelt in December 2020. From the collected data, we were able to difference the ground surface before and after the 2020 BRLS, calculating a total approximate landslide volume of 187,100 m3. Our on-the-ground measurements and analysis of the lidar data provided evidence of paleo-landslides in the area and displaced masses of rock, one of which was the source of the BRLS. This analysis is summarized in Darrow et al. (2022), which is openly accessible online (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10346-022-01899-3). The data collected during this project, available in DesignSafe, will facilitate future analysis of smaller changes in the BRLS surface as it adjusts to a new slope angle and responds to snowmelt and other weather events. The data collected from other landslides that occurred in 2020 will allow change detection for a broader area, the results of which can be incorporated into risk management and disaster response plans.\n\n\nWe also produced a StoryMap presentation from data collected during this project that describes the distribution and timing of the 2020 landslides (https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/611c5690489d46d09ef4e27555e9688c). The StoryMap serves as an interactive outreach tool to create awareness of landslides in Southeast Alaska.\n\n\nThis project supported seven undergraduate students, five of whom were from underrepresented groups. The students participated in the field work, conducted laboratory testing of soil samples, or processed terrestrial scanning lidar and UAV lidar data. Three of the students presented their work at a national science and engineering conference, and one of the students continued on to receive a Master's degree related to this research. This project provided professional development and specialty training for all of these students in areas that exceeded the typical undergraduate curriculum.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/12/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MargaretMDarrow\n"
