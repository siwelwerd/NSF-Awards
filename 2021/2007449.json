 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emergence of new infectious diseases or modification of existing diseases refractive to treatment, or with expanded host range, poses serious threats to human survival. This project will explore genetic and molecular underpinnings of such disease emergence, and may allow better prediction of emerging infectious diseases through host shifts. The fungi, members of the Microbotryum violaceum fungal species complex, that infect a large diversity of wildflower species in the Carnation family (Pinks), provide a unique model compared with organisms that cause disease on more genetically homogeneous agricultural plants. Since shifts of these host-specific fungi to new wildflower species has been observed in nature, understanding the range and limits of such shifts, as well as the genes and proteins involved could provide a unique approach for dealing with ever-increasing diseases that either directly or indirectly affect human health and survival (e.g., by threatening food supply). In the process of investigating such fundamentally and practically important scientific questions, this project will also provide training to a range of students and professional trainees (from undergraduate to graduate student to Postdoctoral), in areas of comparative population genomics and proteomics, and in technical training in state-of-the-art methods used in molecular biological and biotechnological investigations. Concerted recruitment efforts established by the PI target candidates from traditionally under-represented groups in the region of Kentucky and the Southeastern US (specifically, African-Americans, Latinx, women, Appalachians) that enhances their pursuit of an advanced degree. Moreover, a \u201cbridge year\u201d will be established to support recruits as mentors for subsequent minority students recruited. \r\n\r\nThe Microbotryum violaceum complex of fungal plant pathogens is a useful model of emerging infectious diseases through host shifts. As pathogens on genetically more diverse host plant populations, the M. violaceum complex provides an important alternative model to pathogens on agricultural generally homogenous hosts. Pathogenic fungi often secrete effector proteins to manipulate their hosts and these may be an important aspect of host specialization. In Aim 1, populations of Microbotryum on Dianthus host species will be compared to test the hypothesis that fungal small secreted proteins (SSPs) play important roles in localized host adaptation/specificity. Via comparative genomics, we already identified possible Microbotryum SSP effectors across 3 Microbotryum species. Here, comparisons will be added, of \u201cgeneralist\u201d Microbotryum species on Dianthus hosts with a \u201cspecialist\u201d species, limited to one Dianthus host species, to test predictions of local adaptations, reflected in effector function, within the same Microbotryum species. \r\nAim 2 will validate possible effectors in plant hosts.  Expression levels in each fungus, modified by over-expression of specific candidate effector genes via \u201cmix and match\u201d experiments, will assess ability of effectors from one fungal species to expand the host range of another species. CRISPR/Cas9 will be used to delete effectors in fungi and test such mutants in plants. Candidate effector genes in host plants, absent the fungus, will test the hypothesis that the candidate effector is responsible for plant pathology, possibly by modifying host development; such experiments will also provide localization in planta, co-localization studies of effectors and predicted host targets, and Co-IP.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our specific model system is that of a plant parasite, specifically, members of the <em>Microbotryum violaceum</em> fungal complex of species that infect and parasitize members of the Carnation family. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Intellectual Merit</span>: These organisms infect both male and female flowers of their respective host species and most of these fungal parasites characterized so far are highly host specific; i.e., they are Specialists on a particular host species and normally cannot complete their lifecycle on another host. However, some individuals have been found to shift to new host species, and thus, this system has been put forward as a model for understanding Emerging Infectious Diseases. Moreover, we examined the host ranges of some <em>Microbotryum</em> species in this latter category, that do not exactly fit the paradigm and can infect multiple host species, such that we may consider them more as Generalists. The characteristic that all <em>Microbotryum</em> species share is that they replace the host plant pollen with their own fungal spores. The work of this award was geared towards analyzing fungal proteins that are used for such manipulation of the specific hosts. This analysis encompassed bioinformatic (i.e., computer-based) analysis of the genomes from a series of Generalist fungal isolates from a variety of populations, as well as characterization of predicted gene expression differences among these isolates. Such analyses allowed us to identify candidate fungal proteins that could be involved in host manipulation and to examine how such proteins are evolving in different populations. Additional experiments investigated RNA Editing in such species, a phenomenon that involves changes in coding regions of RNAs <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">after</span> they have been initially synthesized. Importantly, we have characterized such RNA coding changes at all relevant stages of the lifecycle, including during infection. Finally, our second main goal was to functionally characterize the fungal proteins used for host manipulation, by identifying the plant proteins with which they interact. We have determined likely host targets for the fungal proteins for a number of these and also identified location of such proteins in infected plants. Moreover, we initiated experiments to provide a more &ldquo;global&rdquo; examination of fungal/host protein interactions during infection. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Broader Impacts</span>: The findings from this project have impact outside of the more narrow or specific area of investigation. Two highly-useful techniques have been developed or refined by our lab to provide the basis for understanding of 1) protein-protein interactions in complex living systems, e.g., in infected and uninfected plants, and 2) exploring the role played by RNA Editing in a variety of biological contexts, including systems that heretofore have gone unexamined.&nbsp; In addition to the extensive training of new scientists in the STEM field, the conclusions make important contributions to our understanding of fungal parasites and parasites more generally. They may also help us to predict eventually, if or when a parasite might shift to a new host, leading to new and potentially serious infectious diseases.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/05/2025<br>\nModified by: Michael&nbsp;H&nbsp;Perlin</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2007449/2007449_10713337_1743890228489_Trichomes--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2007449/2007449_10713337_1743890228489_Trichomes--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Expression of Microbotryum fungal protein in Arabidopsis plant\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2007449/2007449_10713337_1743890228489_Trichomes--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Expression of Microbotryum fungal protein in Arabidopsis plant\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Confocal fluorescent microscopy of A. thaliana plant expressing a fungal protein, localized to the trichome base.
