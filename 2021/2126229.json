 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) is building and deploying a modern, high-performance, high-throughput, and compute-on-demand cluster that balances the growing but distinct research needs for computing, storage, and memory in the diverse areas of astronomy/astrophysics, atmospheric sciences, biomedical sciences, engineering, freshwater sciences, physics, and other fields. This cluster enables UWM researchers to push the computational frontiers of their research, create cutting-edge computational tools, and scale their computations to run on national resources such as XSEDE. The system is also integrated into the Open Science Grid to enable full utilization of idle computing resources to enhance local, regional, and national scientific computational capabilities. Finally, the cluster enhances undergraduate and graduate education and research by providing superior access to large-scale computing resources for student research and computationally intensive classes.\r\n\r\nThe cluster has a total system capacity of 1,568 cores, 9 TB of RAM, 504 TB of storage, and 27K GPU cores.The cluster is comprised of a login/storage server, eight compute nodes, two high-memory nodes, two GPU nodes, a 100 Gbps InfiniBand interconnect, and a 10 Gbps Ethernet network. The nodes are locally accessible to UWM researchers, available to external researchers through the Open Science Grid, and secured with the best practices in cybersecurity and monitoring. The cluster achieves a balance between large CPU counts, GPU cores, large memory, and storage to provide a flexible and responsive resource for a diverse group of researchers to perform their complex computational analyses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIn 2021, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee obtained a 400K campus computing grant entitled \"CC* Compute: A Balanced Cluster For Science and Engineering in the Great Lakes Region\" to upgrade their aging computational infrastructure. The grant allowed the purchase of a new 1500 core cluster with 8 regular node, 4 high memory nodes, 2 gpu nodes, and 1.2 PB of storage to greatly enhance the high performance computational abilities of UWM researchers.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit: Computing forms the third stool of science behind theory and experiment. However, the availability or lack of computation can make or break research at the university level. It has become increasingly clear that the decade old cluster at UWM was aging and needed replacment and supplementation. With the grant, UWM was able to provide their researchers and students with a state-of-the-art computing facility this push the research of their faculty and students to a high gear. It was also crucial in the training of a entire cohort of graduate students participating in a computing summer school, which was also funded by the NSF, an excellent example of synergy across different Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure efforts.\n\n\nBroader Impact: Southeastern Wisconsin is the densest part of the state of Wisconsin population-wise. The availability of advanced computing facilities is key to enabling the economic development of this part of the state. The grant provide this equipment and linked that with educational and research efforts in training students to use cyberinfrastructure. This has enhanced the existing research of the faculty of UWM and nucleated a cohort of students that understand cyberinfrastructure.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/20/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: PhilipChang\n"
