 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of microsensor technologies for the oil and gas industry including monitoring pressure and temperature of production, pipeline/cement integrity, and abandoned wells.  Microsensors may provide an order of magnitude reduction in the cost and logistics of operations and maintenance as compared with other monitoring systems and infrastructure.  In addition, monitoring natural and/or engineered environments at scale creates a near instantaneous opportunity to respond to damage or disaster at low cost for the expected lifetime of the structure.  Other applications of the proposed technology include defense, infrastructure, transportation, and other industries, and it may be possible to create secure networks for monitoring operations such as for radiation, intrusion, or damage.  This technology also may provide inexpensive devices for monitoring stress/strain, corrosion, chemical detection, acoustic crack detection, loading, and vibration to allow maintenance and repair optimization.  The devices are designed to float in streams, rivers, sewers, city water supply, wastewater, pipelines, and sea currents to monitor system integrity, pollution, and other needed variables. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of miniaturized autonomous electronic microsensors and systems for monitoring and logging harsh environments that are currently size excluded, wireless, and wire-denied environments.  The proposed technology has been used to measure temperature and pressure in harsh environments such as oil, gas, drilling mud, well cement, and hydraulic fracturing fluid.  Measurements are stored in onboard memory and timestamped with a continuously running clock.  Upon return to the surface, the devices are read out wirelessly.  Current prototypes are 9mm in diameter, may function up to 125C and 10k psi, and are packaged in two polymer layers. The first polymer layer is designed for hermetic protection, and the second for buoyancy in oil and gas fluids and recovery from fluids produced at the surface. Research to date has shown that they survive lab testing and field testing downhole.  These microsensors are based on integration of downhole capable systems (sensors, high temperature battery, communications, memory, microcontroller, and harsh environmental protective packaging) creating discreet, wireless, autonomous, and millimeter-scale data loggers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAfter more than twelve years of development, involving five universities, a prototype 9mm diameter subsurface sensor microsystem has been created that has successfully measured and recorded timestamped pressure (15PSI-10K PSI) and temperature (20-120C) in a wellbore in connate fluids. This microsystem can also be used for monitoring distribution, pipeline, and flowline integrity, as well as contamination in resource storage wells.  There is no documented device at this size that can provide these sub-surface measurements in an actively producing well, on demand by being injected into liquid flow streams.  Other approaches require disrupting well or pipeline production/operation and or installing expensive and delicate fiber optics during well construction.  Our device can be flowed or pumped into horizontal wells, where data is often not taken due to expense and difficulty.  We envision this device being useful in remotely monitoring system security and health after natural degradation or deliberate disruption. Our stacked sensor platform can be expanded to incorporate additional sensors to address other physical, chemical, and biochemical analytes.\n\nWe learned that 20%-40% of today's horizontal frac stage clusters do not produce in today's wells.  This technology can directly measure these locations, possibly providing a production increase of 20%-40%.  This increased the value of the measurements significantly, as this is not possible today.\n\nFor Hydrogen, we learned that even hydrogen, has greenhouse effects, in that there are reactions that occur between emitted hydrogen and other molecules that result in releasing CO2.  The main negative impact with Hydrogen will be managing leaks in systems that are generating/extracting/compressing and transporting hydrogen.  Detecting these leaks and detecting CO2 are becoming areas of focus for our sensors as well as monitoring hydrogen generation in-situ (underground) from legacy oil and gas reservoirs.  We believe that monitoring and fixing hydrocarbon leaks in pressurized systems on the surface, as well as underground monitoring are important market areas for us.  Without fixing the leaks, even a carbon free energy source such as hydrogen will have global warming impact.  Detecting and locating leaks is a huge problem our microsensors could help with.\n\nWe learned that renewable energy has an intermittency problem.  How to supply energy when the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining.  We discovered two new market areas of focus to address this.  Our sensors have dual use for monitoring geothermal energy production that can supply baseload, low carbon energy.  In addition, we can monitor pressurized horizontal fracs that can act as pumped hydro energy storage and released when needed to make up for electric demand.  In addition, the subsurface sensors could be used to monitor radioactive waste storage.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/17/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Chapman"
