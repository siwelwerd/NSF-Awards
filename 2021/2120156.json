 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving STEM learning environments with a focus on engineering education. A key focus of the project is the introduction of creative glass science elements that enable the creation of a STEAM (STEM + Arts)\u2010infused engineering curriculum and co\u2010curriculum. This STEAM-based project will support the recruitment and retention of engineers and deliver quality science and engineering content to a diverse group of students and to the community. The project hypothesizes that positive student outcomes can be achieved through strategic curricular and co\u2010curricular modifications that integrate and embrace development of STEAM programs. The project builds on prior research that involves highly successful curricular and co\u2010curricular programming integrating arts into an undergraduate engineering degree program. Advances that result from the project have potential to inform and enhance STEAM teaching within programs in undergraduate engineering. \r\n\r\nThe South Dakota School of Mines and Technology proposes to create a degree program that incorporates glass science into an undergraduate materials engineering degree. The project aims to increase the creativity, innovation, collegiality, entrepreneurship, critical thinking, and intellectual diversity of students in the program, and possibly also improve its gender diversity. Specific aspects of the program include new curriculums in glass science and engineering, integration of STEAM laboratory and design content with inclusion of content from an embedded artist\u2010in-residence, and formation of a campus STEAM Council. The project\u2019s research elements address the sustainability of the proposed modifications through: 1) translation of selected programmatic elements to other campus engineering programs, 2) recruitment of students into the revised degree programs, 3) marketing to the campus, local, and state community, 4) involvement of private\u2010sector partners through STEAM\u2010influenced design projects, and 5) dissemination to targeted professional societies and associated stakeholders, including local art centers. A rigorous external assessment of the research will be conducted that includes use of Herrmann Brain Dominance Inventory and the Critical Thinking Assessment Test to determine the effectiveness of program outcomes. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
