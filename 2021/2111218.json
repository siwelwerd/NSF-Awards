 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dark matter is a ubiquitous yet invisible presence in our universe that makes up approximately 85% of the total mass.  It plays a crucial role in how large-scale structures like galaxies form and the observed motion of stars. Its true nature remains elusive, and one compelling explanation is that is made of hitherto unknown particles which interact weakly with ordinary matter. Very sensitive experiments are required for their detection, installed deep underground to shield the much larger flux of ordinary cosmic rays. The DAMIC experiment is designed to detect nuclear and electronic recoils induced by dark matter in charge coupled devices (CCDs). Scientific CCDs are commonly used in the focal plane of astronomical telescopes for the digital imaging of faint astrophysical objects. DAMIC has pioneered their unconventional use as dark matter detectors. This award supports the participation in the DAMIC experiment of the groups at University of Chicago and University of Washington. The groups will carry out the development and testing of the CCD modules, and the installation and commissioning of DAMIC detectors in the underground laboratories toward the analysis of the first dark matter search data. As a part of the award, the groups will provide immersive research experiences, engagement of the local community and the general public, and innovative partnerships bringing science to formal and informal audiences. \r\n\r\nThe nature of dark matter constitutes one of the most fundamental questions in science and the discovery of a yet unknown particle would have profound implications in our understanding of the Universe. First DAMIC CCD detectors have successfully been operated at the SNOLAB laboratory near Sudbury, Canada.  A kg-size detector \u2013 DAMIC-M \u2013 is now in development and will be uniquely sensitive to light dark matter (with mass smaller than that of a proton) thanks to a novel type of CCD that allows the detection of a single ionization charge.  DAMIC-M will be installed at Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane in France. In addition to the development of the CCD detectors, the US groups supported in this award are also responsible for the CCD controller electronics, and perform calibrations of electronic and nuclear recoils in the CCDs down to a threshold of a few ionization charges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
