 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to make  next generation, high-performance carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites available to broad commercial segments such as the sporting goods, automotive, and aerospace industries. Conventional CFRP materials, usually used in laminate form, give excellent engineering performance thanks to low weight and the superior strength provided by advanced carbon fibers. However, mechanical, electrical, and thermal weaknesses inherited from the polymer matrix substantially limit their potential compared with metals in many applications. The next generation CFRP materials demonstrate multiple notable improvements in in those properties, giving significantly better multifunctional performance that can be better tailored to the applications, compared to current CFRP and film adhesive products. Hence, the general quality of living (e.g., recreation, transportation, safety, comfort, energy efficiency, and environmental-sustainability) will be enhanced. These new materials may also contribute to expanding the envelope of the nation\u2019s space exploration and defense missions. The volume-manufacturing development and associated industrial collaboration will increase the usage and market size of CFRP in replacing additional metallic parts and enabling novel applications and technologies.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to develop roll-to-roll manufacturing of novel nanofibers z-threaded CFRP products (prepreg and film adhesive).  The researchers will launch commercialization activities to realize the nanomaterial's full potential in CFRP components. In this new composite, carbon nanofibers zigzag thread between the conventional carbon fibers. The resulting interlocking network strongly reinforces the material, distributing the mechanical, electrical, and thermal loads in all directions inside the composite. As a result, z-threaded CFRP is stronger and more comprehensively capable with tailorable multifunctional properties than conventional CFRP. Nano-resin film adhesive, an intermediate product and precursor of the z-threaded CFRP prepreg, allows customers to create their own prepreg using any fabric of their own proprietary design, or simply to bond two objects together with improved heat and electricity transfer. Thermal-fluidic principles and electric-field induced nanofiber orientation dynamics will be utilized in the innovative manufacturing process. The physical characteristics associated with the products will be exploited for quality control. Interaction with industrial collaborators will allow the team to understand each market\u2019s engineering needs and ecosystems and assist the industries to realize more innovative products using the significantly advantageous next generation CFRP technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The ZT-CFRP accomplished a theoretically-desired nano/micro-scale orthogonally arranged fiber reinforcement network in the novel composite material that consists of many through-thickness (i.e., z-direction) aligned nanofibers z-threading and mechanically-interlocking with many orthogonally orientated micro-diameter carbon fibers thus can overcome many well-known weaknesses of traditional CFRP due to the relatively weaker polymer matrix. Compared with traditional CFRP composites, ZT-CFRP samples have been tested and consistently shown significant improvements in all matrix sensitive properties including longitudinal compressive strength, interlaminar shear strength, in-plane shear strength, mode-I delamination toughness, through-thickness electrical and thermal conductivities. These matrix sensitive properties improvements have also been found useful for more precisely locating defects in a composite laminate with thermography non-destructive evaluation (NDE), improving the adhesive bonding between two composites parts, and improving the fire resistance of polymer composites. The ZT-CFRP prepreg has also be used for 3D-printing to produce 3D-printed composite samples stronger than traditional composites manufactured by conventional molding methods. The novel method to manufacture the ZT-CFRP prepreg and the novel performance of ZT-CFRP both open up many opportunities in future basic research, applied research, and commercialization.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The completion of the roll-to-roll ZT-CFRP prepreg production machine allowed the team at the University of South Alabama to produce ZT-CFRP prepreg samples swiftly and efficiently and use the samples and production capability to collaborate with other academic and industrial partners for the application areas of sporting goods, aerospace, automotive, and wind energy. Due to the innovation, potential impacts and commercialization values, the University of South Alabama has filed and held eleven granted patents and five pending patent applications of ZT-CFRP technology. The research results, especially the increased availability and production speed of the next generation ZT-CFRP, of his PFI-TT project will be utilized for two major directions: 1. Explore the commercialization development of ZT-CFRP technologies and products in various markets (automotive, sporting goods, aerospace, defense, and energy). 2.
