Even a tiny amount of a solid contains an enormous number of electrons, which, when they coordinate their actions, can induce remarkable effects and useful material properties, such as magnetism, switching, and superconductivity. This project seeks to discover new examples of such effects and expand our understanding of existing ones. In particular, the research will study unusual magnets and conductors, make theoretical predictions for experiments to probe their novel quantum capabilities, and determine how to manipulate the electrons within these materials using electromagnetic fields. A core component of the study is to incorporate recently developed abstract theoretical ideas about ways in which electrons can cooperate quantum mechanically, known as entanglement and topological order, into practical proposals for experiments. The results of the research may be the basis of new technologies and quantum devices. All the research will be continuously compared with and referenced to real materials and experiments, with this feedback refining directions for theory to ensure maximum impacts in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nTraining of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers is an integral component of this project. These junior scientists will learn forefront areas of condensed matter and quantum theory, as well as develop general scientific, communication, and computational proficiency, through mentorship and collaboration on the research. These skills prepare them to participate productively in the nation's quantum workforce.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical research on the quantum physics of quantum magnets and ordered topological metals, to discover the fundamental mechanisms in which electrons act together to produce new states of matter, and to predict what novel properties these states possess. The studies of quantum magnets will determine their dynamics in and out of equilibrium, providing experimentalists with clear signatures to seek in the laboratory, both for highly entangled (e.g. quantum spin liquid) states and for ordered ones. Furthermore, the research will design ways to control materials' properties in situ via oscillating fields. The projects on ordered topological metals address a different way to control materials' properties - their topology - through induced symmetry breaking order. The studies will determine how the topology of electronic states is modified by domains and topological defects of different types of order, such as magnetic domains and domain walls in topological magnets, and in turn, how this topology influences the properties and responses of those domains and defects.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nMaterials are the \"stuff\" that we build technology from. Learning how they work is enabling and also humbling: we see how nature creatively uses just three fundamental ingredients of electrons, protons, and neutrons to create a limitless diversity of substances. The theoretical challenge is to understand how she does it, and then use that deepened understanding to manipulate materials and their properties, or design new ones. This project applied methods of theoretical physics to develop practical and mathematical descriptions of what the electrons are doing inside of different types of materials, and how they can be controlled by accessible means in the laboratory such as changing temperature, applying magnetic fields, or exerting mechanical strains.\n\n\nOne of the major themes of this type of research is the phenomena of magnetism. Electrons can work together to produce magnetic moments, like tiny bar magnets, inside a material which can be arranged in a great diversity of patterns. The patterns in some cases can be visualized as a gradually twisting array in which from place to place these little magnets adopt different orientations, twisting into what is called a magnetic texture. Certain types of textures have the property of chirality -- they do not look the same in a mirror -- that is intimately tied to the flow of electrical current. It turns out that such textures induces \"anomalous\" current flow, in which electricity or heat moves perpendicular to an applied electric field. Such \"chiral magnetism\" is the most robust way known to produce anomalous currents at or near room temperature where it can be most useful. One major result of this project is a detailed theoretical model of how magnetic moments twist in the material Mn3Sn, which is perhaps the best-performing chiral magnet in this sense known today. This theory predicts and explains how the twisting texture changes in response to strain, magnetic field, and temperature, and is proven by comparison with experiments that measure both the texture and the electronic response.\n\n\nAnother thrust of the project was to describe excitations of magnetic materials. Due to the laws of quantum mechanics, the energy a substance be absorb or emit is quantized into discrete amounts which depend upon the momentum transferred to or from the material. The relation between these two is called a dispersion relation, and determining it, as well as the efficiency with which the energy transfer occurs, is a key step in understanding how magnetism works in a given solid. In some cases a mature method known as spin wave theory describes these properties. In this project, new methods were developed and applied that work when spin wave theory fails. The calculations explained surprising results of experiments in which dispersion relations were measured by scattering neutrons off of materials and measuring their energy and momentum change. Ultimately understanding and manipulating these unconventional excitations is enabling for quantum science.\n\n\nThe project also went beyond magnetism to study other emergent properties of quantum materials. The most notable result was an understanding of spontaneous \"nematic\" order in certain conducting solids composed of rather two-dimensional atomic layers. In these layers the atoms are arranged at room temperature in a highly symmetrical pattern known as a kagome lattice. As temperature is reduced to about 100 degrees K above absolute zero, the electrons spontaneous organize into a less symmetrical pattern. What was surprising is that a subtle directionality appeared in certain measurements, that did not seem compatible with the measured patterns within a single atomic plane. What the research of this project showed is that the directionality comes from the relative stacking of these patterns in different planes, and from a theoretical model how this stacking predicts the results seen in scanning tunneling microscopy and non-linear optical measurements of these materials. These results are enabling scientists to attack the next challenge in these materials: the appearance of superconductivity at lower temperatures.\n\n\nThe research provided training of next generation scientists wholearned the skills to carry out independent and collaborative researchin STEM disciplines. Three postdoctoral scientists and two PhD students were involved in the research and published peer-reviewed journal papers, attended conferences and delivered lectures, and in the latter case completed portions of their PhD theses as part of the project.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/03/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LeonMBalents\n"
