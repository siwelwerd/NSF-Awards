This project will extend the technology for real-time, full-frame Fourier transform spectroscopy based on a 2D-imaging, reference-scanning Michelson interferometer coupled to a high-speed camera with the data sent via a high-speed parallel optical fiber connection. The project will  impact education through training of two post-doctoral and several undergraduate students (through SRI's REU program which the PI co-directs). The project will also support SRI's unique mission in making connections between academia and industry.",

A particular emphasis of this research is on speed. With measurement of many more colors or wavelengths, there is much more data to collect than in a simple color image.
