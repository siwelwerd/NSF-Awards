 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). \r\n\r\nThis doctoral dissertation project examines variation in caregiving attitudes and practices, the resulting impacts on pregnancy outcomes, and caregivers\u2019 attempts to improve outcomes in general while navigating differential institutional conventions. Caregivers face tradeoffs between individualized care and broader organizational priorities, and this research investigates how caregivers balance those tradeoffs while effecting organizational change. This research valuably contributes to scholarship on the practice of health care amid divergent economic, ethical, and institutional challenges. By focusing on multiple comparable institutions, the research helps to characterize individuals\u2019 contributions to organizational change. The results from the study help to guide the implementation of health care in diverse contexts. This study contributes to the training of a graduate student in scientific methodology and analytical approaches. \r\n\r\nThis project examines how caregivers provide support and healthcare for pregnant and post-partum women in diverse organizational settings with limited infrastructure and access to resources, particularly prisons. The investigation focuses on tradeoffs imposed by the caregivers\u2019 concurrent attempts to effect positive organizational change while maintaining high standards of health care. Using a combination of methods, including observational approaches, interviews with a diverse sample of stakeholders, focus groups, and an analysis of social media content, the investigators examine how caregivers navigate these tradeoffs in multiple organizational settings. This comparative approach contributes to scholarship on the multifaceted factors that shape how healthcare providers advance and implement improvements to the systems in which they work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifically, this project looked at how doulas, as a particular type of healthcare (para)professional, care for incarcerated women; how they navigate the unique priorities, conventions, and complexities of medical and carceral institutions (e.g., prisons and jails); how they attempt to implement changes in those systems to help improve incarcerated clients' health and wellbeing; and in all of these, how the pursuit of reproductive justice is facilitated or constrained. As emerging professionals in relatively powerless positions, doulas must walk a \"tightrope\" between advocating for clients and maintaining relationships with carceral and biomedical institutions, whose priorities and conventions do not (necessarily) match doulas' orientations towards health and reproductive justice. The study thus examined the possibilities and limits for harm reduction strategies in complex institutional circumstances among stigmatized groups. Between 2021 and 2022 the co-PI spent 19 months conducting participant observation with four prison and one jail doula program; interviewed 50 jail/prison doulas, 4 formerly incarcerated women, 8 healthcare providers, 5 jail/prison staff and administrators, and 14 program donors, interns, and/or volunteers; and collected social media and documents across several programs. In total, she gathered data from 24 programs across 16 states.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Overall, the data showed that doulas use multiple strategies to \"care\" for incarcerated clients through different types of encounters, including group-based education and support, one-on-one emotional and informational support, labor/birth support, \"separation visit\" support (when women returned to custody without their infants), lactation support, and sometimes community-based support. Doulas contrast the ways in which they \"treat clients like human beings\" and provide nonjudgmental support to clients to the sometimes punitive and callous ways in which clients are treated in medical and carceral settings. Some doulas, drawing on reproductive justice principles, also work to \"horizontalize\" their relationships with clients by paying careful attention to power dynamics, elevating clients' voices whenever possible, designing programming explicitly based on client feedback, and working to \"meet women where[ever] they are\" in their parenting journeys. If clients are receiving inadequate physical and/or mental healthcare, doulas can both witness and advocate for improved medical treatment and provide emotional support where it is otherwise lacking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While doulas feel that these strategies can and do improve certain health outcomes for clients, their services are extremely dependent on the permission and goodwill of carceral staff and administrators. Doulas feel their positions to be extremely precarious (they can be kicked out at any time) given the uneven power dynamics, opacity, inconsistency, punitive attitudes, racism, sexism, and lack of communication that can characterize carceral settings. Doulas therefore try to strategically \"pick their battles\" when it comes to client advocacy, though this can lead to feelings of being complicit with harmful systems. Doulas that center reproductive justice principles thus characterize their intervention as a form of harm reduction that is necessary, but limited, in what can be achieved without the cooperation of institutional partners. Doulas fear that their care may be coopted if it is presented as a singular \"solution\" to the harms of prison birth.

In current systems, doulas provide an important intervention to improve physical and mental health outcomes for clients but cannot address the full scope of challenges that clients face inside and outside of custody.
