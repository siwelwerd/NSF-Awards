 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conventional agricultural practices are causing erosion rates that exceed the rates of soil production and threaten agricultural sustainability (Montgomery, 2007). Although climate models predict continued increases in the severity of floods and losses in crop productivity, they currently do not include the feedback loops for how the landscape changes over time. Virtually all models predicting impacts of climate change rely on topographic and soil maps that are assumed to stay the same. We know these assumptions are incorrect, but those static inputs are used because they are the best data available. The ultimate goal of this project is to assemble an erosion-deposition model for landscapes where the rate of sediment transport, not rate of weathering, limits the amount that those processes change the topography and soil properties of hillslopes. The recent implementation of highly accurate, remotely sensed elevation measurements more than a decade apart offers a unique opportunity to validate such a model at the regional scale. This knowledge is crucial for incorporating landscape change into models that predict impacts of climate change, such as effects on flooding and crop productivity. The model will also be used to generate scenarios of landscape change from real landscapes, which can be explored and employed as an educational tool through a publicly accessible, web map interface. Training and curriculum materials will be developed in collaboration with educators experienced with delivering Earth Science content to diverse student audiences.\r\n\r\nThe major barriers limiting the use of hillslope erosion-deposition models to predict topographic change for low relief landscapes are the disciplinary divides between geomorphology and soil science as well as the absence of data for full validation. Geomorphology studies tend to focus on high-relief landscapes. In contrast, soil scientists typically investigate lower relief, agricultural areas in the context of mass removed and effects on soil properties, such as carbon content. Therefore, an integrated landscape model is needed that combines the theories of geomorphology and soil science to predict landscape change in the areas that currently experience the most active erosion and that are crucial to securing food and feed needs in the future. The PI will study hillslope erosion-deposition models and calibrate them to multiple landform regions within the USA Corn Belt. These models will be validated and evaluated through the elevation differences observed between the 2009 and 2020 LiDAR-based elevation data collected for the state of Iowa. This project is jointly funded by the Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics (GLD) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
