And while great progress has been made in understanding the functions of diverse brain networks, their evolution remains less well characterized. This doctoral dissertation project focuses on a crucial network in the evolution of intelligence, the cortico-striatal system (CSS), which mediates learning and the regulation of behavior, two of the most outstanding cognitive adaptations in humans. The investigator measures the neuroanatomical variation of the CSS across many primate species, thereby enhancing our understanding of the evolutionary changes in the brain that led to the emergence of human intelligence and cognition. The project also includes public science outreach activities and generation of open source data. This research also has impact beyond the anthropological sciences by informing clinical research on species-specific vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases and addiction.\r\n\r\nThis project studies the relative size and connectivity of the CSS across primates. As specific subregions of the striatum mediate different modes of learning and stages of behavioral control, the investigator quantifies the variation of the relative volumes of the three striatal nuclei to understand how CSS-based learning and behav-ioral optimization have evolved in primates. The connectivity of the striatal subregions is measured across pri-mates to elucidate selection on cortico-striatal pathways that may relate to species-specific behavioral de-mands. The project employs phylogenetic comparative methods to model changes in scaling and rates of evolu-tion of functionally specific components of the CSS at different taxonomic levels (e.g., primate order, anthro-poid suborder, human genus).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While significant progress has been made in understanding the functions of diverse brain networks, their evolution remains much less well characterized. Yet explaining brain evolution is essential to understanding the origins of human intelligence and how it differs from other animals. Given that brains display morphological adaptations in response to environmental, social, and cognitive pressures, a proven approach to studying brain evolution is to measure the differences among living species in the neuroanatomical substrates for specific types of cognition. In particular, this project focus on a crucial network in the evolution of intelligence, the cortico-striatal system (CSS), composed of the neural connection of the neocortex and the striatum. This system mediates learning and the regulation of behavior, two of the most outstanding cognitive adaptations in primates, particularly in humans. The CSS has allowed the emergence of new cognitive domains, including different learning mechanisms, the optimization and automaticity of behavior, and the formation of habits. Despite the significance of the CSS to the generation of higher cognition, little research has investigated the evolutionary history of its components. Consequently, by measuring the neuroanatomical variation of the CSS across the primate phylogeny (organization of species according to their common ancestry), this research significantly enhances our understanding of the evolutionary changes in the brain that led to the emergence of human intelligence.</p>\n<p>This project studies the neuroanatomy of the CSS (relative size and connectivity) across primates (Image 01).

The whole striatum was captured in a total of 55 primate species (from all extant families), an unprecedented, elevated number of specimens for this type of high-resolution neuroanatomical comparative studies (Image 02).

The origins of human intelligence and these human-specific neuropathologies are fundamental scientific questions that cannot be appropriately interpreted without incorporating a comparative evolutionary approach as proposed in this project.
