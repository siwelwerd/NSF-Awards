 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integrated circuits and systems-on-a-chip in modern electronic devices have transformed virtually every aspect of daily life. In these devices, the need for efficient power delivery and management has never been more critical across applications from low to high power: smartphones to data centers, battery-powered components to renewable-energy-powered grids, and from stationary systems to robots and aircraft. The challenge is to satisfy increasingly demanding requirements for efficiency, size, reliability, and cost - all simultaneously. The Power Management Integration Center (PMIC) addresses these challenges. The University of California San Diego (UCSD) joins PMIC as a new site in addition to the original site at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth to significantly expand the overall capability for research and training students, adding new research capabilities to the Center. The UCSD site will work with PMIC to bring together leading academic and industry researchers to develop more efficient systems and higher-density integrated power electronics with the potential to transform transportation, communication, healthcare, and energy generation and consumption. The Center will integrate fundamental research with education in integrated power electronics and energy efficiency by attracting, training and mentoring a broad range of students, including students from underrepresented backgrounds to become leaders in this STEM area. \r\n\r\nUCSD's focus on power integrated circuits (ICs) complements University of Massachusetts Dartmouth's emphasis on passive components research and opens opportunities for collaborations combining UCSD ICs and Dartmouth passive components. In addition, the UCSD researchers bring unique expertise in high-voltage ICs, power management at very low power levels for applications such as Internet-of-Things devices, wide-bandgap technologies, and special techniques for power management in radiofrequency (RF) applications. UCSD also brings access to faculty expertise in related areas such as materials, devices, and systems. The UCSD site's research focus will be on three thrusts: (I) integrated power delivery and management circuits, including integrated converter topologies, architectures, circuits, and 3-D packaging for high-performance computing and battery management; (II) power management for next-generation communications systems with the focus on next-generation (5G/6G) transmitters and power amplifier; and (III) wide-bandgap materials, devices, and high-voltage circuits for power delivery and management. The contributions from the UCSD site can provide fundamental additions to help PMIC achieve its goals in enabling higher efficiency, smaller size, and reduced cost for a wide range of electronic devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
