 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nBasaltic volcanism throughout Earth history has profoundly shaped the evolution of Earth\u2019s crust and atmosphere, as well as the evolutionary path of life itself.  In this study, erupted basalts are used as windows into the underlying mantle from which they were formed.  The goal is to develop a new thermometer/hygrometer that enables both the temperature and water content of basalts to be readily and accurately obtained.  Its ease of use will help generate large data sets, which will allow questions to be addressed about global differences in basalts erupted from diverse tectonic settings and throughout Earth history.  The new thermometer/hygrometer will be made available to all interested users as a downloadable excel file. Two UM graduate students from diverse, under-represented backgrounds will work on this project. They will gain a broad range of skills, from expertise in conducting high-temperature and high-pressure experiments, performing thermodynamic calculations, and applying their results to better constrain mantle conditions that lead to partial melting.  In addition, undergraduates from the M-STEM program at the University of Michigan (UM) will be recruited to work on this project.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to continue the experimental calibration a new olivine-melt thermometer that is based on the partitioning of Ni between olivine and basaltic liquids (DNiol/liq), and to further test whether it is independent of dissolved water at both crustal and mantle depths. Currently, the most widely used olivine-melt thermometers (based on DMgol/liq) are strongly dependent on water, and their application to hydrous basalts requires that melt H2O concentrations already be known, which is not always the case. With an H2O-independent thermometer in hand, based on DNiol/liq, it can be applied to olivine phenocrysts in hydrous basalts to obtain accurate temperatures, without prior knowledge of melt water contents.  These temperatures can then be combined with Mg-based olivine-melt thermometers to obtain anhydrous temperatures and thus the magnitude of \u2206T, the depression of the olivine liquidus due to dissolved water.  Experiments will be performed to evaluate whether this depression of the olivine liquidus due to water is linearly and inversely correlated with the partitioning of Ca between olivine and melt (DCaol/liq), as indicated in preliminary work.  To extend the calibration of this new olivine-melt thermometer/hygrometer, experiments will be performed on a variety of basaltic compositions over a range of water contents, temperatures, pressures (crustal and mantle) and fO2 conditions.  Additionally, it is proposed to apply the new thermometer/hygrometer to a large number of natural basalts from a variety of tectonic settings.  The results will shed light on the thermal/hydrous conditions in the mantle during partial melting across a variety of tectonic settings, from subduction zones to mantle plumes to continental rifts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
