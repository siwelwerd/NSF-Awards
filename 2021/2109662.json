 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Insect herbivore evolution is tightly linked to changes in their host plants. Many plants possess defensive traits (e.g., induced production of toxic secondary metabolites) that enable them to naturally tolerate and/or deter insect herbivory. However, fluctuations in trait expression may promote insect adaptations to overcome these defenses (virulence). Climate factors associated with global climate change can disrupt plant defense expression, subsequently altering plant susceptibility to insect herbivores. Whether these changes also affect the development of virulence remains unknown, an important knowledge gap that this project aims to fill. Understanding these evolutionary interactions is critical for preserving global food security. Within agricultural production systems, insect resistant crops enhance plant productivity, but virulence threatens their longevity as a sustainable pest management tool. Results from this project will be broadly disseminated, with outreach efforts focused on increasing public awareness about insect resistant crops. The Fellow will develop and disseminate learning modules to high school students in traditionally underserved groups, and additional outreach to agricultural stakeholders will help growers consider genetically modified and naturally resistant crops when making planting decisions.\r\n\r\nUsing soybeans and soybean aphids as a model system, the project will characterize how one abiotic factor, water stress, impacts aphid adaptation to host plant resistance (HPR). Soybean phytohormone concentrations will be used as a marker to determine how combined aphid and water stress interact to alter HPR expression. The Fellow will then assess how these abiotic-induced changes to soybeans impact aphids by comparing fitness in virulent and susceptible aphids using life table analyses. Concurrent RNA sequencing will also characterize aphid stress gene expression under the different climate scenarios. Finally, experimental mesocosms will test whether water stress alters the frequency of virulence within an aphid population. Collectively, these experiments are expected to directly link host plant climate stress to population level responses in aphids, improving our understanding of the mechanisms by which climate change may facilitate virulence. Throughout this project, the Fellow will expand technical skills through training in molecular biology and bioinformatics. Additional professional skills will be developed through participation in mentorship training programs and outreach to non-academic audiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
