 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mississippi Alliance for Women in Computing (MAWC) project will identify factors that influence and motivate female students and female African American students in Mississippi to enroll and persist in an undergraduate engineering- or science-based computing major.  There is a particular need for programming that is inclusive of women and women of color who are from the southern region of the United States. These students typically have less access to extracurricular activities that encourage computing, and are less likely to visualize themselves in a computing major or career. This proposed research is to help girls to know that computer science exists and what jobs in computer science are available with a degree in computer science. A rich environment exists in Mississippi for an alliance focused on building co-curricular and mentorship opportunities.  A scalable pipeline model, expandable to a Southern Alliance for Women in Computing (SAWC), will be developed with three major objectives: to attract women and women of color to computing, to improve retention rates of women in undergraduate computing majors, and to help postsecondary women make the transition to the computing workforce. Activities to support these objectives include: scaling the National Center for Women and Information Technology Aspirations in Computing award program in Mississippi, expanding scholarships for Aspirations winners, expanding student-led computing outreach programs, establishing a Mississippi Black Girls Code chapter, informing and collaborating with the Computer Science for Mississippi initiative, creating a summer bridge and living-learning community for women in computing majors, and increasing professional development opportunities for women in computing through conferences, lunch and learn meetings, job shadowing, and internships.\r\n \r\nThe project will analyze whether the co-curricular activities of MAWC lead to computing self-efficacy and ultimately female students selecting to pursue and persist in computing majors and careers.  In order to understand student participation and efficacy changes, data collection for this research will be through demographic and background surveys administered to women entering an undergraduate engineering- or science-based computing major at a university in Mississippi and student surveys and evaluations in MAWC-sponsored programs.  Using discriminate analysis methods, specific research questions to be addressed are: 1) Which pre-collegiate experiences influenced them to enroll, 2) Which stakeholders influenced these girls in their decision-making process, and 3) What programs are effective in impacting their persistence in the major. Predictor variables for each respective research question are: pre-collegiate experiences, stakeholders, and programs. Outcome variables are: (a) a female undergraduate student with no involvement with MAWC programming, (b) MAWC activity participant, or (c) a MAWC participant having graduated with a bachelor?s degree in a STEM major. Results will complement published longitudinal research on the gendered and raced dimensions of computing literacy acquisition in Mississippi as well as research on effective CS role model programming.",

Activities designed to engage females with computing, emphasizing computational thinking and cybersecurity knowledge and awareness, and to illuminate a pathway forward were hosted and facilitated through MSAWC partnerships. MSAWC outcomes informed formal K-12 computer science education, documented the importance of mentoring and tutoring services in retention of computing undergraduate students, and connected workforce development entities with higher ed to provide alternative pathways to computing education and the higher wage jobs that result from that skills development. Through connecting people in Mississippi to stakeholders from outside the state, MSAWC conversations sparked ideas that resulted in a larger consortium to bring computer science and cybersecurity education to under-represented minority and female students throughout the United States and a non-profit to provide wrap-around services that help women persist in undergraduate computing majors.</p>\n<p>Data Collection through MSAWC activities, facilitated at the host institution, found that both tutoring and counseling services were the most influential among other campus student services in helping participants persist in a computing major. Summer outreach computing program participation, student interest in technology, access to high school engineering/computing courses, and familial and other mentors were all influential in the choice to select a computing major as an entering undergraduate student.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Significant Outcomes of MSAWC partnerships and collaborations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;Mississippi Coding Academies (MCA): MCA provides workforce development training, at no cost to participants, for rapid upskilling into higher wage technical jobs such as full stack software development, technology support, and cybersecurity. The non-profit MCA has collaborative governance with InnovateMS, The University of Southern Mississippi, Mississippi State University (MSU), and other industry, government, and non-profit stakeholders through its Board of Directors. Three-fourth of the trainees that have completed the program are from an under-represented minority group and around one-fourth are female.

A 3-hour credit course, \"Computing and Cyber Security Integration in the Classroom,&rdquo; for in-service teachers based on Attract-Inspire-Mentor was designed at the undergraduate/graduate level and is offered at Mississippi State University. In August 2019, The Mississippi State Board of Education approved a 12-hour pre-service computer science endorsement for Grades K-8 and an 18-hour supplemental endorsement for Grades 7-12. \"Computing and Cyber Security Integration in the Classroom\" was selected to be part of the grades 7-12 endorsement curriculum at MSU.</li>\n<li>Bulldog Bytes K-12 Student Outreach Program: Established at Mississippi State University, this program introduced over 1000 K-12 learners to computing and cybersecurity.

To close the gap in schools offering CS coursework, CSForAll, with NSF funding, provided leadership for this project with the US Airforce JROTC Headquarters, and an Advisory Consortium of industry and other stakeholders.
