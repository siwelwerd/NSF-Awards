 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Symposium on the Strategy for Resilient Manufacturing Ecosystems through AI is a series of three workshops that convenes the advanced manufacturing research and practitioner communities, relevant companies, federal agencies and national laboratories and the Manufacturing USA Institutes and experts in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications, information technology, and computer science to comprehensively assess the role of AI in manufacturing competitiveness. The workshop series, held under the auspices of the Subcommittee on Advanced Manufacturing and the Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence of the National Science and Technology Council, seizes on an accelerating convergence of the digital transformation of the manufacturing industry and the increasing power of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\r\n\r\nThe two researched workshops build on a successfully completed first Workshop on Aligning AI and U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Competitiveness and build on the report of that workshop.  They will be conducted using a professionally-managed, virtual teleconference that will emphasize the four strategic priorities identified in the first workshop: AI for the Factory Floor, AI for Industry-Wide Data Sharing, AI for Discovery of Capabilities and Solutions, and AI for Building Resilient Supply Chains.  The second workshop will identify R&D recommendations for AI solutions in each strategic area and determine how they integrate into an adoption cycle and the third workshop will organize R&D and implementation priorities into a national strategy in the form of primary workstreams and critical elements for advancing the adoption of AI in Advanced Manufacturing and maximizing its value for U.S. industry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
