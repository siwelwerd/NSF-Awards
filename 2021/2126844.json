This database can be used for outreach, benchmarking, and other applications.  The forecasts developed can be used to inform strategic resource allocation decisions and other discussions regarding environmental sustainability.  \r\n\r\nThis project integrates traditional carbon analysis methods, such as Life Cycle Assessment, with distributed ledgers and the internet of things to create a global carbon emission tracking system.  This system will incorporate data from a sensor network measuring air quality, water quality, atmospheric carbon levels, and other variables. This project will conduct design and development of a dynamic system of carbon tracking using blockchain to verify records over time, creating a centralized, tamper-proof record for global carbon emissions. The project will also develop improved models and forecasts on various regional, industrial, and temporal scales.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
