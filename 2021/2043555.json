 "awd_abstract_narration": "The history of medicine in the Middle Ages is often characterized as unusual, and considered far removed from modern medicine. But this ignores two important areas deserving further study: the medieval roots of many twenty-first century medical practices, and continuing concerns about the safety and efficacy of drugs. The fears of alternative medicine groups promoting homeopathy, essential oils, and \u201call-natural\u201d remedies can be found as far back as the Middle Ages. The goal of this project is to study the practice of pharmacology in the Middle Ages in relation to the Franciscan Roger Bacon\u2019s (d.1292) practice of medical alchemy, through which he attempted to produce medicines that would prolong human life. Bacon\u2019s medical alchemy exemplifies thirteenth century attitudes towards medical practice, which simultaneously deferred to classical authorities and advocated for experiment and the creation of new knowledge. By examining extant manuscripts written by Bacon in light of contemporary 13th century medical authorities, this project examines the ways in which Bacon believes the theories of alchemy - which teaches how both organic and inorganic substances are generated - provides the means to create more effective pharmaceuticals. This history of pharmacology is important both for historians of medicine and current medical practice: it clarifies understanding of the early use of inorganic materials and their manipulation in medicine. \r\n\r\nBy examining Bacon\u2019s alchemical and medical theories in light of thirteenth century medical education and practice, this project answers three central questions: (1) What types of medicines does Bacon think are useful in restoring health? (2) What physiological effects do these medicines have on the body, and why are they effective against disease when other medicines fail? And (3) How can we characterize the relationship between Bacon\u2019s medical theories and those taught in universities? In situating Bacon within the 13th century medical traditions that focused on creating panaceas such as theriac, this research shows that Bacon, while certainly unique in many of his ideas, is still a part of the thirteenth century intellectual culture and that his ideas are molded by advances in medicine and contemporary theological discourses. It is imperative that the originality of Bacon\u2019s ideas be established, as previous scholars have suggested that for the first 150 or so years after its introduction to the west in 1144, alchemy was focused more on the transmutation of metals than the making medicines. Thus Bacon is generally considered the first western author to unite alchemy and medicine. If it could be shown that Bacon\u2019s alchemical ideas were influenced by others, then the early history of western alchemy, especially its ties with medical practice, would need to be re-examined.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
