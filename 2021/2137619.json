In particular, this is to provide students with a unique experience through the virtual conference attendance where they can present their work at the Student Research Forum and meet with peers and experts in their research area. These funds will focus on women, underrepresented minorities,\r\nand non-author students and provide them the opportunity to virtually attend the conference and participate in its Student Research Forum.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
