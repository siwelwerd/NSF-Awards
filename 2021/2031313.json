 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and test a novel system to treat blockages of the blood vessel to the eye, known as Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO).  Approximately 32,500 people are affected by CRAO in the U.S. and currently no effective therapies exist for them.  This project will develop a treatment for this and related conditions caused by insufficient oxygen flow to the eye.  The proposed technology will increase quality of life and reduce the burden of treatment for these otherwise chronic conditions.\r\n \r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the development of dextran oxygen nanobubble (DONBs) for CRAO and other ischemic retinal conditions. Acute hypoxic injury from artery occlusions currently has no acceptable treatment. Mitigating the severity of insult due to oxygen deficit especially during the first 24 hours is vital, before the onset of permanent damage. The DONBs will be nontoxic, stable, have sufficient shelf life for long-term storage, with sufficient oxygen carrying capacity and release properties to rescue retinal tissue from hypoxia.  DONBs can be delivered through pars plana with a 30-gauge needle, allowing for safe delivery by injection into the vitreous cavity, a well-accepted technique in ophthalmology. Unlike most of the existing nanobubbles, the current formulation is perfluorocarbon-free, nanometer in size (100 \u2013 400 nm), nontoxic, and directly injectable into the eye.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
