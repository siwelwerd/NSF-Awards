 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance an improved system to sense and map  atmospheric conditions using nano-drones that are the size of small birds; these systems have benefited from recent innovations in miniature power electronics and flight control sensors.  The proposed project leverages the safety, cost and portability advantages of these small form factor aircraft in a system of coordinated drones flying in formation to measure wind, temperature, humidity and gas concentrations. Each flight of the swarm can cover hundreds of square miles, creating a high resolution 3D map of atmospheric properties. This enables the study of wind currents and gas movement for applications including detection of urban gas leaks, smog movement, and forest fire detection. Satellite measurements can be validated and improved through aerial measurements. This research will benefit public health.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project will advance new software to analyze and optimize nano-drones. This project will expand the understanding of miniaturized (under 100 g) drone performance and enable the development of advanced nano-drones to carry out valuable sensing missions. This project will: (1) validate an optimization framework with laboratory test data; (2) develop a novel, portable drone docking station allowing for easy launching, landing and charging of hundreds or thousands of drones by a single operator, eventually enabling fully automated use for continuous monitoring applications; and (3) develop visualization and analysis tools to facilitate data analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
