 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will improve infection control in public transportation.  There is currently no high-speed, autonomous method capable of decontaminating commercial aircraft and public transit vehicles. The proposed technology rapidly inactivates viruses and other potential biothreats in an automated robotic disinfection system.  \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes development and scaling of a system using radiofrequency (RF) directed energy to activate a benign chemical, producing biocidal reactive oxygen on surfaces.  Preliminary studies of MS2 bacteriophage viruses have demonstrated inactivation of 99.999999% of MS2, despite being 7-10x more difficult to inactivate than SARS-CoV-2. The proposed system consists of four subsystems: application sprayer, RF, robotics, and power. This project will optimize and integrate these subsystems. A key technical objective is identifying the power density threshold and appropriate frequency for virus inactivation without negative interactions with electronic equipment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
