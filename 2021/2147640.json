 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the modern era of big data, a crucial challenge is to discover useful information that is buried in highly redundant, seemingly irrelevant, incomplete, or even corrupted data sets. Such information is often contained in certain low-dimensional structures hidden within the high-dimensional space of the data, or may only depend on a small subset of the data. How to extract this information efficiently and automatically remains an open problem. This project brings together two emerging areas of research \u2014 hyperdimensional (HD) computing and geometric algebra (GA) \u2014 to tackle this problem from a new stand point by investigating the data representation and the intrinsic geometry of the data. This research is also the first in a systematic quest to uncover the potential of using the high-dimensional generalization of complex numbers in analyzing and discovering patterns in large-scale sensing data. The success of this research can help advance the capability of other machine learning models, such as deep neural networks, which are mostly based on real numbers today.  It also brings a powerful mathematical tool (GA) which is mainly known in the physics community into the machine learning community.\r\n\r\nHD computing is a brain-inspired framework for machine learning and artificial intelligence that is based on representing quantities or symbols as high-dimensional vectors and manipulating vectors with simple operations. In recent work by the investigators, it was shown that by using complex-valued vectors in HD computing it is possible to encode images in such a way that patterns can be effectively recognized by a factorization of HD vectors. To build on this direction, they are exploring the use of geometric algebras which generalize complex numbers to any n-dimensional space. The following thrusts form the core of this research: (1) explore ways of mapping data into the geometric algebra space;  (2) investigate how to integrate geometric algebra with the operations of HD computing;  (3) apply these methods to real application domains such as multi-microphone speech recognition or distributed sensing to evaluate their efficacy and computational efficiency.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nHyperdimensional (HD) computing is a brain-inspired approach to machine learning and artificial intelligence. By representing quantities or symbols as high-dimensional vectors and manipulating vectors with simple operations, it is possible to form data structures such as key-value bindings, and to perform symbolic operations such as search over keys or values. However it has been less clear how to represent and manipulate numerical quantities using this framework. Doing so is important because the ability to form metric representations of geometric objects and their 3D pose in a scene is central to perception and cognition. \r\n\n\nOur work under this project made a fundamental advance on this problem by utilizing complex, phasor-valued vectors to represent numbers. This allows for representing one's position in the world, or the pose of an object within a visual scene. Moreover, due to the algebra of HD computing, is possible to update and manipulate these representations, for example by shifting the representation of position as moves through the world. A key to making this robust and efficient is the use of residue number systems, which represent a number modulo a set of base numbers (or moduli). We showed in this work how residue numbers can be represented as HD vectors, and how a number can be factorized into its residues using a recurrent neural network we call a resonator network. We also discoverd a method for forming efficient, two-dimensional representations of position within a triangular coordinate frame using HD vectors that form a non-negative encoding of position along each coordinate. When implemented as a neural network, the sytem exhibits response properties similar to so-called 'grid cells' in entorhinal cortex.\r\n\n\nThe work of this project lays the groundwork for building autonomous systems that maintain and update internal representations of state variables, and which do soefficiently, at low-power, and in a manner that is robust to noise or hardware errors. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/14/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: BrunoAOlshausen\n"
