 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abigail Kopec is awarded an NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at the University of California, San Diego. Kopec will lead searches for signatures of particulate dark matter and neutrinos in the new XENONnT experiment, and investigate the sensitivity of a single-phase liquid xenon time projection chamber (TPC) to single-electron signals to enhance the detector\u2019s low-energy sensitivity. As a key part of the program, Kopec will mentor undergraduate and graduate students in the proposed projects and participate in department activities to promote a positive inclusive culture and plans to take on leadership roles mentoring newer members within the XENON Collaboration. \r\n\r\nThe particle nature of dark matter remains one of the greatest mysteries in physics today.  The study of neutrino properties has provided clear evidence that the Standard Model is incomplete, and the first confirmed particle dark matter detections would represent a signature of physics beyond the Standard Model.  The program to enhance the the XENONnT TPC low-energy measurements holds the potential for significant impact in both of these areas,  including increased sensitivity to lower-mass weakly interacting massive-particle dark matter, and harnessing solar neutrinos to provide the potential first observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nuclear scattering on xenon atoms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Her research uses liquid xenon-based particle detectors to look for dark matter or neutrinos interacting with xenon atoms. Over 70% of the mass of the Universe is expected to be dark matter, but it does not emit or reflect light, and we still do not know much about it. As part of the XENONnT collaboration, she works with graduate students and other postdocs around the world to understand the lowest-energy interactions detectable in XENONnT. These interactions are mostly expected to be by neutrinos from the sun but could also include dark matter interactions. On this topic, Kopec mentored two undergraduate students and two summer high school students in this research to understand detector backgrounds that may be confused with dark matter signals. In the laboratory at UCSD, she explored an alternative design for a liquid xenon detector that she determined could be a better technology to detect these lowest-energy interactions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The XENONnT detector is located a mile underground in Italy to reduce the number of particles (other than neutrinos or dark matter) falling from space that could interact with the xenon. To illustrate cosmic particles in outreach events, such as at the San Diego Festival of Science &amp; Engineering Expo Day 2023, Kopec built a cloud chamber to watch muons. During her fellowship, Kopec spent two months on site in Italy to ensure the detector was running smoothly and collecting useful data. She became the first female run coordinator for the experiment and managed the first all-female shift. The data she was able to take in Spring 2022 continues to be invaluable for studying the detector effects affecting the lowest-energy interactions. She organized an analysis workshop on this topic at UChicago in June 2023, attended by collaborators from Sweden and Germany in addition to graduate students and a fellow postdoc from UChicago and UCSD. Kopec guided undergraduates through research projects as part of this analysis, one of whom presented her results at an Undergraduate Research Symposium in Texas and to the collaboration in a weekly analysis meeting. During the summer of 2022, two high school students from Mexico also conducted a research project contributing to this analysis as part of UCSD's ENLACE program.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the first time, Kopec created the necessary conditions to observe the proportional electroluminescence of individual free electrons in liquid xenon. To date, major liquid xenon particle detectors have either drifted electrons to a gaseous xenon layer to create electroluminescence (such as in XENONnT) or collected electrons and ions in wires. Extracting electrons from the liquid to the gas for electroluminescence requires energy to overcome the phase transition, and some electrons get stuck and are not measured. Wires are not sensitive to individual electrons or ions. By taking advantage of the photoelectric effect of metal wires in a demonstrator at UCSD, Kopec knew when to look for a single-electron's electroluminescence and showed that the single-electron photon gain was consistent with extrapolations from more detectable interactions that produced many electrons and are therefore brighter signals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through the support of this fellowship, Abigail Kopec was able to search for dark matter with XENONnT and direct international efforts to further define known backgrounds that might obscure dark matter signals. She was also able to make the research accessible down to the high school level, present it at international conferences, and invite public interest in the field through outreach events. Additionally, she demonstrated a new type of detector that could aid in the search for dark matter.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/03/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Abigail&nbsp;M&nbsp;Kopec</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2137911/2137911_10836896_1696356897820_CloudChamber--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2137911/2137911_10836896_1696356897820_CloudChamber--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cloud Chamber Outreach\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2137911/2137911_10836896_1696356897820_CloudChamber--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cloud Chamber Outreach\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Third Grade Students look for the cloud tracks left by muons falling from the sky.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Abigail Kopec</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Abigail&nbsp;M&nbsp;Kopec</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cloud Chamber Outreach</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2137911/2137911_10836896_1696357100050_XENON_Ladies--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2137911/2137911_10836896_1696357100050_XENON_Ladies--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"All-Female XENONnT Shift\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2137911/2137911_10836896_1696357100050_XENON_Ladies--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"All-Female XENONnT Shift\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PI Kopec and an Italian female graduate student pose during routine operations on the XENONnT detector.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Abigail Kopec</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Abigail&nbsp;M&nbsp;Kopec</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">All-Female XENONnT Shift</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2137911/2137911_10836896_1696357387557_APS_2023--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2137911/2137911_10836896_1696357387557_APS_2023--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"APS 2023\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2137911/2137911_10836896_1696357387557_APS_2023--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"APS 2023\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PI Kopec presents analysis work at the APS April Meeting 2023 in Minneapolis, MN.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dacheng Xu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Abigail&nbsp;M&nbsp;Kopec</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">APS 2023</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
