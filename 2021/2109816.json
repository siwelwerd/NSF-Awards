 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. The Fellow will study microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc.) living in the gut of African elephant orphans brought to an orphanage in Kenya. Using dung samples, the Fellow will identify which microorganisms are present within the orphans in order to determine if microorganisms change as the orphans move from the wild to human care and eventually back into the wild. The Fellow will also investigate whether the elephants\u2019 health and behavior change according to which microorganisms are present. This research will therefore consider how living organisms are unified with other living things that live inside them. The Fellow is likely to discover new microbial species, and conservationists may use this new understanding of microbiome-host dynamics to increase the survival of captive-raised individuals of endangered species when they are released into the wild. Dissemination of this information will reach a diverse public audience, including through an international collaboration with Kenyans.  \r\n\r\nData will be collected from three areas within Samburu, Kenya: the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary (Reteti), Sera Rhino Sanctuary (Sera), and Samburu and Buffalo Springs National Reserves (the reserves) where a long-term monitoring project of elephants takes place. Dung samples will be collected every two weeks from the orphans beginning at Reteti and after their release into Sera. Wild elephants in Sera, who have the same environment as the released orphans, and wild elephants of the same age as the orphans at the reserves will also be sampled during the study. These wild elephant dung samples will be used to assess whether orphans can develop microbial communities similar to wild individuals. The Fellow will measure the environment, physiology and behavior of orphans with data including but not limited to body condition scores, diet records, weight records, intestinal worm loads, glucocorticoid levels, focal behavioral follows, and GPS collar fixes. The Fellow will be trained in laboratory techniques to identify microorganisms and arrange to employ and share these skills at a newly built laboratory in Kenya. The Fellow will lead data collection in collaboration with the sponsoring institution and several Kenyan wildlife organizations, exchanging knowledge and writing papers with Kenyan researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, what we know about host-associated microbiomes in wildlife is limited. We sampled the dung of wild African savanna elephants and sequenced their gut microbiome to add to our understanding of factors that influence gut microbiomes in wildlife.</p>\n<p>Our most significant finding was that livestock presence seems to change the gut microbiome of wild elephants. When more livestock shared space with the elephants, the elephants' gut microbiomes were less diverse, and the abundance of certain species within the microbiome changed. Although we do not know whether this is bad news for the elephants, we believe more research should be conducted to determine if it might make them more susceptible to disease; microbial species known to be good for human health decreased, and species found within livestock dung increased, when livestock were using the same areas as the elephants. Although livestock and elephants have coexisted for a very long time, recent decades have seen an explosion of livestock across the globe, and associated conservation concerns may not be limited to habitat destruction and changes we can observe with our eyes. It seems an overabundance of livestock may also trigger changes in host-associated microbiomes of wildlife species, microbiomes that are important to behavioral and physiological health. This is especially concerning for threatened and endangered species like the African savanna elephant.</p>\n<p>We also found that young elephant calves under two years of age have different microbiomes as compared to older elephants. This is important for the management of young wild orphans who are brought into human care for rehabilitation. Caretakers may increase the survival of these calves, both during rehabilitation and following release, if they supplement their milk replacement with microbes that will build the calves' microbiome to be more similar to that of adult wild elephants. Caretakers may also supply wild elephant dung for the calves to consume, as wild calves eat the dung of older elephants in their family group, and this may serve to develop their microbiome.</p>\n<p>Finally, many of the microbial species that we found in the elephant dung have yet to be identified; in other words, we found new genetic information corresponding to microbes that have not been cultured in a laboratory. Adding this genetic informatiion to a public database has furthered our recognition of these species, which may be cultured and given a name in the future. It is hard to understate the importance of cataloging the life we share this planet with, as recognizing a species' existence is necessary to understanding its function and actively preserving it.</p>\n<p>Being an NSF PRFB fellow allowed me to work with early-career researchers in Kenya, assisting them with data collection, analysis, and written and oral communication of their findings to their community, wildlife managers, and conservation practitioners.
