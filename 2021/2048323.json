 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support travel for 25 early career researchers in the field of cartography and geographic information science (GIScience) to attend the 30th International Cartographic Conference (ICC). This project targets the professional development of early career scholars who are currently completing a graduate degree, or are in the early stages of their academic, professional career. The ICC covers all aspects of cartographic research and is an ideal scientific venue for young scholars to present their research and to talk face-to-face with an international community of scientists. The merit of this funding is evident from previous young scholars who have attended the ICC, as reflected in their scientific publications and funding awards to support research. The broader impact of this support for students and early career scholars is research innovation and collaboration that promotes future global leaders in cartography and GIScience from the United States.\r\n\r\nParticipation in the ICC will lead to the development of cutting-edge research and will enable U.S. scholars to take the lead in these endeavors. These young scholars develop new research agendas that investigate key scientific and societal challenges, promote collaboration with the international community, and disseminate advances in cartography and GIScience through workshops, seminars, and peer-reviewed publications. These accomplishments result in the development of more innovative and productive research in cartography and GIScience that serves the Nation\u2019s interests regarding spatial information infrastructure. The event will provide new insights and approaches to cartographic research throughout the world, including the United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
