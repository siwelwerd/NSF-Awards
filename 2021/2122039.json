The  workshop series will build upon prior work and extant knowledge to further explore the topic in the context of the Convergence Accelerator. The workshop discussions will be centered around the theme of \u201cbuilding confidence\u201d, where \u201cconfidence\u201d is defined as (1) scientific or empirical certainty that the elections were performed accurately and securely and (2) that winners identified, in fact, received more votes than the losers, and that the election was conducted fairly.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview\n\nFour facilitated workshops spanning 16 hours were held in the spring of 2021 aimed at creating an agenda for the translation of fundamental science into methods to improve the administration of elections in the United States. The 110 experts who were brought together were drawn from state and local election administrators, election technology providers, scientists, technologists, federal officials, and policy experts. \n\nThe final report is available at https://electionlab.mit.edu/events/election-science-c-accel. \n\nParticipants applied their expertise to identify specific areas of important research that had developed to the point that they could benefit specifically from the discipline of the C-Accel program.  After sifting through the work product generated by workshop participants, the PI Committee distilled fourteen challenges to election administration that would benefit from the program:\n\nEvaluating Tools for Election Administration\nEnsuring Usability within the Voting Experience\nImproving Access to Voting\nCommunicating Effectively with the Electorate\nDetecting Anomalies in Election Management Systems\nSharing Election Results for Research, Dissemination, and Anomaly Detection\nVisualizing Election Data\nEnhancing Voter Identity Verification\nSecuring Electronic Ballot Delivery &amp; Return\nImplementing End-to-End Verifiability\nImproving Cybersecurity for Election Administration\nManaging Election Geography\nPromoting Sustainable and Scalable Sharing of Election Technology\nDeveloping Next-Generation Voting Technologies\n\n\nThrough the C-Accel program, the NSF has the opportunity to challenge the election science community to focus its efforts over the next few years on making tangible progress toward translating exciting fundamental and applied research into action. In addition, the NSF has opportunities through its more traditional grant programs to help foster election science research that will pay dividends in the future.

Thus, the NSF, working in partnership with other federal agencies, has a vital role in providing the resources to encourage ongoing fundamental, applied, and translational research in election science.\n\n \n\n Intellectual Merit\n\nUnderstanding and building confidence in the outcome of elections is a topic that has been the subject of scholarly study for many years, often in response to events in the nation that have called the confidence in question.  These workshops provided an opportunity to assemble a proactive strategy based on established science to establish partnerships between the scientific and practitioner communities to develop confidence-building policies, practices, and technical innovations.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe goal of these workshops was to strengthen elections, which are the foundation of American democracy.  Improving and securing elections cannot be accomplished through societal actors working in isolation.  It requires collaboration.  The findings of the workshops, reflected in detail in the final report, provide a roadmap to guide many fruitful collaborations in the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/26/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles Stewart"
