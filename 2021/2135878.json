 "awd_abstract_narration": "CSforALL will convene a workshop of Computer Science (CS) education, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science (DS) leaders to explore education pathways to careers in AI and AI-related fields. The workshop will be followed by a report with guidance for decision makers regarding implementation of these important topics, and recommendations for policy that will ensure equitable implementation across the landscape.  An emerging movement has centered the related computational disciplines of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science, and numerous organizations and curriculum projects are advocating specifically for these flavors of CS education in classrooms. The workshop seeks to leverage the current moment in time to create coordinated community efforts to significantly impact trajectories for learners through the US education system with an outcome of (1) better preparation of all students to live in a digital world where AI and Data Science significantly impact everyday life, (2) strengthen pathways for computing professionals with appropriate preparation to use AI and data science in their careers, (3) excite the next generation of AI and Data Science researchers to contribute to the landscape of technology in the world, and (4) broaden the participation of women, Black, hispanic, indigenous, and other underrepresented populations in the educational pathways that result in the outcomes listed.\r\n\r\nArtificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and data science (DS) are key to innovation, today and into the future. There is a national need to create a more diverse and inclusive workforce of AI innovators, and create fundamental understanding of AI in all. The workshop aims to (1) create clarity around the CS education movement and mechanisms for equitable change resulting in broadening participation in CS and AI, ML, and DS pathways; (2) review of current movement goals  and national CS standards to update guidance; and (3) inform movement trajectories that align with promising practices for equity and broadening participation in AI, ML, and DS pathways.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
