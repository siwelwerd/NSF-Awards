 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to increase the number of Black male youth who can be successful in advanced mathematics while in public schools. The researcher will use a mixed-methods design to gain a comprehensive and culturally appropriate student perspective. The project includes the implementation of a group counseling program for Black male students beginning in seventh grade and following them through eighth grade. The researcher will gain the knowledge and skills necessary to integrate quantitative and qualitative data from students and stakeholders to provide a theoretically sound foundation for future STEM education-related research. These data will be analyzed using two theoretical frameworks to create a baseline of new knowledge to develop culturally appropriate strategies for math instructors and school leaders.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to advance programs, knowledge, and skills targeting Black male middle school students so that they can gain access to, and be successful in Algebra 1.  This study will be guided by the following research questions: a) to what extent does the group intervention model increase the racial identity, resiliency, and mathematical identity scores of Black male seventh-graders compared to a wait-list control group? b) to what extent do stakeholders\u2019 perceptions, understandings of structural challenges, and perceived support contribute to Black male seventh-graders successfully accessing Algebra 1 in the eighth grade? c) is there a relationship between the Black male students\u2019 experiences with successfully accessing Algebra 1 in the eighth grade and their stakeholders\u2019 perceptions? and d) what are the recommendations Black male students and their stakeholders offer as strategies for successfully accessing Algebra 1 in eighth grade and persisting to advance level math courses in the future? Developing a strong racial and mathematic identity for Black students is necessary for engaging in general school practices. STEM access, persistence, and other related predictors have been explored, but identifying strategies to help Black males sustain an interest in pursuing STEM fields is needed. This study will be among the first to use a triangulated explanatory mixed-method design to explore both Black students\u2019 experiences, their stakeholders\u2019 perceptions, and the integration of these findings when accessing Algebra 1 in eighth grade.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For the student survey, four constructs were included: (1) the Math Identity Scale (MIS) with 20 items, (2) the Multi-Ethnicity Identity Measure (MEIM) with 12 items, (3) the Math Support System Questionnaire (MSSQ) with 16 items, and (4) the Math Confidence Scale (MCS) with 18 items. For the student surveys, all four constructs achieved acceptable level of internal consistency with Cronbach&rsquo;s &alpha; above .7 (&alpha;<sub>_MIS</sub> = .884, &alpha;<sub>_MEIM </sub>= .862, &alpha;<sub>_MSSQ </sub>= .723, and &alpha;<sub>_MCS </sub>= .923). However, the internal consistency for MSSQ school-staff version was low with Cronbach&rsquo;s &alpha; only .062. This indicates that MSSQ was not a consistent measure to access school staff&rsquo;s perceptions on math-related supporting system for students, and there was more than one underlying theme existing in this construct. To examine the relationship between students and school staff regarding their perceptions on math support within in the community, the overall Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated using sum scores for each items in MSSQ, with the value of .56. However, due to the relatively small sample size, the statistical power for this correlation was not significant, which is common in small sample sizes. Nevertheless, the correlation of .56 still modestly indicates the positive correlation between students and school staff regarding their perceptions on math supporting system, meaning generally, their perceptions are coherent with some level of discrepancy. For further quantitative investigation, we attempted to filter out the items that presented the most discrete opinions from two sides. To do so, we used the frequency as the indicator and checked the modes for each item in both student-version MSSQ and school-staff version MSSQ. We found that six out of 16 items had the most opposite responses. Students and school staff tend to have the most distinct opinions on adult support, peer support, and school support. Students tend to believe they have sufficient adult support in math in the community from neighborhood and family members, whereas school staff do not think so. However, school staff tend to believe adults in the community positively reinforce students for behaving well, whereas students have the opposite opinion. School staff believe the school has a quality support system to help students learn math outside of the classroom, but students do not think so. Lastly, students are positive in believing that their peers can successfully perform in math, but school staff hold a relatively negative opinion about this. More data is needed to provide a clearer picture of the supports and barriers that exist within the students, the community and/or the school. Furthermore, findings from this study are incomplete as the study started with the goal of using a triangulated explanatory mixed methods to explore both Black students&rsquo; experiences, their stakeholders&rsquo; perceptions, and the integration of these findings when accessing Algebra 1.
