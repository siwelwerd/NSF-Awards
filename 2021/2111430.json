Engine emissions directly impact the environment, public health, and wildlife. Improved engine design can operate in parallel with other  energy-efficient measures with minimal need for new infrastructure.  The proposed project advances a new engine architecture designed for efficiency and reduced emissions. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will yield a new engine technology for a low-cost, high-power density, environmentally-friendly two-stroke engine. The proposed system will: address shortcomings of a traditional two-stroke engine, eliminate oil from the combustion process, offer durability, and control combustion and emissions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
