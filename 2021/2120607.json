 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes an interdisciplinary network of biologists and artists to develop and implement teaching practices that integrate artistic expression with biology education.  This approach builds on the demonstrated cognitive and academic benefits of art-enhanced instruction in biology courses to increase creativity, course engagement, and concept comprehension by diverse students:  traditional and non-traditional, and biology majors and non-majors.  This project\u2019s rationale is rooted in two national trends.  First, undergraduate students are becoming increasingly \u201cnon-traditional\u201d, and these students show lower degree completion rates and more difficulty integrating into university life than their traditional counterparts.  Second, this proposal is a response to recent calls from national advisory bodies for the integration of education in biology and the sciences with the arts and humanities, as well as emphasis on the college graduate as a scientifically literate member of society.  To engage diverse students with diverse learning preferences, this project emphasizes concrete, immediate expression of concepts in biology, and encourages thinking about concepts from diverse perspectives.  By providing opportunities for students to interpret and express course material in personal, creative ways, this project addresses the achievement gap faced by non-traditional students and enriches the course experience of biology majors and non-majors.  \r\n\r\nThis project has two main objectives: establish a collaborative network of biologists and artists to develop and implement methods and techniques of art-enhanced instruction in undergraduate biology courses and increase course engagement and concept comprehension among biology-majors and non-majors through art-enhanced instruction.  To achieve the first objective, the network will hold a series of meetings to develop feasible art-enhanced course material, as well as appropriate assessment approaches and metrics for project evaluation.  Ten art-enhanced biology instruction and ten non-art-enhanced biology courses will be implemented at four institutions (two HSIs, a teaching-focused university, and an international institution that includes programs offered through a Native American education center); three courses for non-majors and seven for majors. Major courses will include lower level (General Biology) and upper level (Invertebrate Zoology, Ecology, Cell Biology, and Microbiology) biology.  Formative evaluation will assess the processes through which the network develops and implements the integration of artwork in biology courses and summative evaluation will examine the outcomes of implementation through assessment data on student course engagement and concept comprehension.  \r\n\r\nThis project is being funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, as part of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The network successfully grew to 47 members at 38 institutions:&nbsp; R1 and teaching universities, community colleges, museums, and NGOs.&nbsp; These institutions serve diverse students, including Hispanic/Latino students, rural populations, military veterans, and working adults.&nbsp; Network membership is international, with members at universities in Canada and South Korea.&nbsp; Members are at diverse career stages, including full professors, early and junior faculty, adjunct faculty, and graduate students; 70% of members are women and persons of color.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With regard to implementation of artistic expression, 15 biology courses at 10 universities and colleges incorporated artwork (10 courses for biology majors; five for non-majors); enrollment in these courses was 348 students.&nbsp; In addition to these courses, seven biology courses served as \"control\" courses (four courses for biology majors; three for non-majors); enrollment in these courses was 120 students.&nbsp; One course with artistic expression, Invertebrate Zoology at National University, was completed relatively early in the Incubator year, and therefore enabled preliminary analysis of assessment data on student performance.&nbsp; Analysis reveals that students score substantially higher on concepts on which they do artwork compared to concepts that do not involve artwork.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Major project activities included regular project meetings, four exhibitions of student artwork, and a teaching workshop to develop biology instructors' skills in art fundamentals.&nbsp; Project meetings occurred on a monthly basis via Zoom, during which network members discussed principles of biology education and how best to incorporate artwork.&nbsp; Biology through Art organized four student artwork exhibitions in collaboration with museums in San Diego.&nbsp; These exhibitions enabled in-person interactions among network members, as well as opportunities for students to gain experience in presenting work in a poster session format.&nbsp; The exhibitions' venues provided outreach opportunities to communicate and interact with the visiting public.&nbsp; Three exhibitions were at the San Diego Natural History Museum.&nbsp; The fourth exhibition was at the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego, which included participation by students at a local high school.&nbsp; The teaching workshop was a two-day exploration of techniques in drawing and color theory and how to include them in biology courses.&nbsp; The workshop was in San Diego, and project funds enabled out-of-town members to attend.</p>\n<p>Biology through Art's products communicated results to educators as well as the general public.&nbsp; The project developed a website (bioart.qubeshub.org), and connected to other projects that focus on undergraduate biology education.&nbsp; \"Biology through Art\" has been created as a Special Interest Group in SABER (Society for the Advancement of Biology Education Research).&nbsp; Network members presented ideas and preliminary results at four education conferences, including SABER West (2023) and Cultivating Ensembles: Exploring Across STE{A}M (2022).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/07/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;R&nbsp;Maxwell</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2120607/2120607_10749045_1680844928784_feb2022-b--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2120607/2120607_10749045_1680844928784_feb2022-b--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Venus fly-trap\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2120607/2120607_10749045_1680844928784_feb2022-b--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Venus fly-trap\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student drawing venus fly-trap after lecture on plants (Survey of Bioscience, National University).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mike Maxwell</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;R&nbsp;Maxwell</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Venus fly-trap</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2120607/2120607_10749045_1680845045319_sep2022-2b--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2120607/2120607_10749045_1680845045319_sep2022-2b--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Magnolia\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2120607/2120607_10749045_1680845045319_sep2022-2b--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Magnolia\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student presenting acrylic painting on concept \"magnolia\" at exhibition at Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mike Maxwell</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;R&nbsp;Maxwell</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Magnolia</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2120607/2120607_10749045_1680845186203_sep2022-b--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2120607/2120607_10749045_1680845186203_sep2022-b--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Exhibition at Museum of Contemporary Art\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2120607/2120607_10749045_1680845186203_sep2022-b--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Exhibition at Museum of Contemporary Art\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student artwork exhibition at Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego.
