 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smart spaces are characterized by the presence of smart services built on emerging sensing, computing, and communication technologies. This planning grant will create a multi-university Center for Smart Space Research (CSSR) involving Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and the University of California, Irvine (UCI). CSSR takes an integrated approach to make them versatile and adaptable to situations by ensuring the availability and accessibility of data, knowledge, and services. This planning grant will identify research challenges to build application-focused smart spaces. Applications encompass health and disease monitoring systems, smart buildings, public spaces and cities, mission-critical systems, transportation, intelligent manufacturing, collaborative robotics, and others.\r\n\r\nThe center\u2019s focus will involve four main areas of relevance to industry, university, and society: creation of adaptive computing and communications infrastructure; trustworthy acquisition, processing, interpretation and sustainability of data and knowledge; applications that span all aspects of life and the environment; and creation of diverse and competent workforce.  UCI researchers will collaborate with industrial organizations, technology developers, and users, to investigate: adaptive and resilient multiscale network communications; data-driven real-time adaptations for mission-critical applications; multi-tier and edge-cloud computing methods, IoT data management and security/privacy techniques for instrumented spaces. These collaborations will facilitate transition of research to practice in smartspaces.\r\n\r\nThe planning phase of CSSR will impact research and pedagogical activities at UCI and stimulate technology transfer to collaborating industries. Our work will emphasize smartspace applications to improve quality of life and enhance community resilience in challenging situations. CSSR will leverage ongoing and future projects to reach underprivileged populations with varying socio-economic backgrounds. UCI is a Hispanic-serving institution with a  diverse student body. The planning grant workshops will promote interactions with industry and create opportunities to recruit and mentor diverse groups of students in undergraduate capstone projects, graduate courses and internships creating a future workforce in the area of smartspaces. \r\n\r\nIn the near future, access to smart spaces and smart infrastructure will impact every individual and will greatly improve quality of life. CSSR activities in fostering innovation in accessible smart spaces will play a major role in the future world. The planning phase will serve as a platform for meetings, discussions, and workshops, to identify critical research to guide the development of smart spaces. CSSR will maintain a publicly-accessible repository comprising meeting materials, workshop information, research topics and details, and publications. This repository will be maintained at a publicly accessible URL at RIT for the lifetime of the center.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Initially, the center will have 2 sites: RIT will be the lead site, with a partner site at the University of California, Irvine. \n\n \nDuring the planning grant phase, we conducted a range of activities including seeking potential industry partners through a discovery process.  A part-time staff member, Sabine Kunrath, was hired at UCI to help out with the process of partner discovery and to help with the logistics of the numerous meetings both for UCI and RIT.  Local PIs and staff went through the bootcamp material provided by NSF to understand the discovery process.  Numerous  meetings (over 200) with industry partners from diverse verticals and layers of the technology stack provided us with insight on what would be useful projects to incorporate into the proposed center. The academic team visited local industry partners and engaged with them in understanding their market, goals and needs.

All of these activities led to a planning meeting with several stakeholders/partners to select a subset of the proposed projects.  A Phase 1 proposal was submitted. \n\n \nA planning workshop for the center was held virtually on April 11 and 12, 2022. The meeting was co-hosted by RIT and UCI; the NSF team, and representatives from 18 organizations attended the meeting, in addition to about 50 faculty and students from the two universities.

This was followed by  closed-door discussions and voting by the industry members. Based on the voting the top 6 out of 10 proposed projects were selected to be performed at CSSR as noted in Intellectual Merits. The projects that were not selected for immediate pursuance were titled, \"Data Staging in Smart Environments\", \"Integrated At-Home Physical and Mental Health\", \"Smart Spaces for Behavioral Health\" and \"Dynamic Neural Pipelines for Real-Time IoT Systems\". Subsequently, the UCI and RIT team worked together to refine tprojects selected by the IAB members for the initial round of the Phase 1 proposal.    The project identified multiple broader impact and educational opportunities for students and researchers at both institutions.  This spurred further efforts in the direction of projects identified in the planning meeting such as follow-up workshops and meetings with industry partners.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/25/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nalini Venkatasubramanian"
