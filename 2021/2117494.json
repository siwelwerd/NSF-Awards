 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Loyola University Chicago (LUC) to purchase a Transmission Electron\r\nMicroscope (TEM) in support of research, teaching, and outreach. This equipment will be used\r\nby LUC researchers as well as graduate and undergraduate students in STEM fields. Through\r\ndidactic courses and research mentorship, over 100 LUC undergraduate students will gain\r\nvaluable training on this machine annually. Two undergraduate courses at LUC will utilize the\r\nTEM as will two courses at neighboring undergraduate institutions. The TEM will have the\r\ngreatest impact on high school students engaged in summer research at LUC. Each year, LUC\r\ninvestigators host 40+ aspiring scientists from Chicago area high schools. This high school\r\nresearch experience will include training and hands-on exploration using the TEM. Thus, the\r\nTEM will promote student training both at LUC and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis TEM enhances research at all levels. It enables imaging, sizing, and elemental mapping of\r\nsamples for a diverse ensemble of scientific fields ranging from biology to materials chemistry to\r\nenvironmental sustainability. Representative examples include imaging of bacteriophages, the\r\ncellular structural stability of malaria parasites, microscopic structures of lizard scales, bacterial\r\nbiofilm formation, cartilage and bone formation in fish embryos, and peripheral nervous system\r\nstructure. Furthermore, this machine can examine the chemistry that occurs at the surface of\r\nprototypical small molecule organic semiconductors as well as element-specific measurements\r\nof metal accumulation in living tissue. Thus, the TEM instrument will stimulate the productivity of\r\nthe existing research projects as well as train the next generation of scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
