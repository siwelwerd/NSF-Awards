 "awd_abstract_narration": "Urban areas are home to more than half the global population and showcase powerful synergies between climate and human activity. In urban areas, modification of the land surface by humans is especially evident and impacts climatology from local to regional scales. Urbanization causes significant changes to local and regional climate due to major modifications of surface energy, water, and carbon budgets. The outcomes of this research project aim to improve understanding of how greenspace in urban areas impacts energy, water, and carbon dynamics, which will inform emerging and evolving approaches to adapt to and mitigate the negative environmental impacts of urbanization. The outcomes of this work will inform efforts to intentionally modify near-surface climates through the strategic use of urban vegetation. Furthermore, a workforce that is trained in the unique science and management of urban areas is increasingly important. Providing integrated research and learning opportunities for undergraduate students is a priority of this project, especially for women and underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis project explores emergent questions and hypotheses in urban ecohydrology using an iterative and integrated combination of local observations, eddy covariance networks, remote sensing data and modeling approaches to assess the role of dynamic urban greenspace in energy, water and carbon cycling. Small scale processes investigated in ground-based field efforts will be linked with large scale processes using modeling approaches and remote sensing products. These research activities will provide a better understanding of the controls on land surface-atmosphere interactions and how they influence larger scale feedbacks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Urban greenspaces, despite their growing spatial extent, their impact on the land surface and its feedback with the atmosphere, and their direct societal relevance, remain one of the most relatively understudied land cover types. Understanding how water, energy, and carbon dynamics are affected by the greenspace in urban areas can help mitigate and prepare us to adapt to some of the potentially negative effects of urbanization. Increased knowledge could support efforts to intentionally modify near-surface climates to our advantage through the strategic use of urban vegetation.\r\n\n\nThe project highlighted three main findings:\r\n\n\n(1) While temperatures are generally increasing in urban areas globally, these increases are lower in shrinking cities than those cities that are continuing to experience urban growth. We also observed slightly lower increases in precipitation from shrinking cities in a wet period from 1970s to 2010s. We did not see seasonal wetness change across all the cities over the years.\r\n\n\n(2) Vegetated areas developed as green infrastructure has great importance in large shrinking cities with aging and outdated infrastructure; however, the water, carbon and energy cycling of this green infrastructure is not well understood. Our research suggests that that plant characteristics such as water use efficiency impact thewater, carbon and energy cycling within bioswales. Retrofitted bioswales will need to be adapted over time to meet environmental demands associated with projected shifts in precipitation to adapt to changing rainfall patterns and continue to provide important ecosystem services.\r\n\n\n(3) Due to the timing of this project, the unique circumstances associated with the COVID-19 pandemic allowed our team to team to make use of a temporary reduction in traffic to evaluate the role of urban greenspace on carbon dynamics. Using the city of Detroit as a case-study during the COVID-19 pandemic, our research suggests that urban vegetation may have greater carbon mitigation potential than traffic reductions.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/27/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ShirleyAPapuga\n"
