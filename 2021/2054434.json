 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's Indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This Targeted STEM Infusion Project (TSIP) aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the body of knowledge on traditional fishpond restoration and management.\r\n\r\nThe University of Hawai\u2019i\u2013West O\u2019ahu will enhance math and ecology instruction through studying the restoration and management of traditional Hawaiian fishponds. An integrated data-driven wetland ecological restoration, based on traditional ecological knowledge of land and ocean, will increase research opportunities for students and improve relevancy of math and ecology courses. Students will utilize western science and traditional knowledge in ecological restorations and deliver presentations to community groups and scientific audiences. The project will strengthen relationships between the institution and community, while supporting STEM student pathways between community colleges and the university system. The project\u2019s focus on data collection, analysis, and modeling will provide strong data skills for students, while using a systems-approach to understanding fishpond restoration. An interdisciplinary plan will expose students to a variety of fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
