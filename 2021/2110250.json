 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future technology, such as quantum computation or advanced electronics, is predicated on gaining control and understanding of quantum mechanical systems with large numbers of interacting degrees of freedom.  High precision experiments involving lasers, optical cavities and cold atoms have become the ideal setting to demonstrate this control and uncover the principles which can be exploited.  This project involves using the tools of theoretical physics to model these experiments, seek organizing principles, explore novel phenomena, and enable future progress. The intellectual merit of this research lies in developing a deeper understanding and better control of the natural world, which may have associated broader impacts in quantum technology. The scientific projects address both long-standing challenges such as exotic \"strange metal\" behavior in transition metal oxides as well as novel developments in dissipation engineering. \r\n\r\nThis project will model non-equilibrium and emergent many body physics in ultracold atoms and Rydberg polaritons. The research is organized around three interconnected themes: transport in strongly correlated many-body systems, control of open and out-of-equilibrium quantum systems, and modeling 1D quantum systems. The first direction involves modeling experiments in which ultracold atoms emulate the behavior of electrons in \u201chigh temperature superconductors.\u201d  Through this modeling, it is hoped the mechanism behind high temperature superconductivity may be constrained, providing progress towards room temperature superconductivity.  The second direction involves using ideas developed in the quantum information community to control quantum many-body systems. It is motivated by ongoing experimental challenges around equilibration in atomic, molecular, and optical systems. The third direction involves producing new numerical algorithms for exploring the behavior of continuum one-dimensional systems. This will be key to answering fundamental questions about equilibration, and modeling experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
