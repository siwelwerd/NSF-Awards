 "awd_abstract_narration": "Online videos are becoming increasingly popular with young children. This presents a challenge for parents and educators who want them to watch educational videos but may lack the ability or time to distinguish educational from non-educational content within the rapidly growing universe of online video. To our knowledge, there are currently no machine learning methods for classifying educational video content; current methods rely on humans to identify video content. But human content reviews cannot keep pace when, on average, approximately 500 hours of content are uploaded to YouTube every minute. The goal of this project is to develop Technology to Review Online Videos for Education (TROVE), a machine learning-based tool to identify early childhood mathematics content in a high volume of videos. This capability will enable new approaches to increase young children\u2019s exposure to developmentally appropriate mathematics content in videos, which has been shown to improve mathematics learning outcomes. TROVE will lay the groundwork to identify a range of subjects in videos, including literacy, science, and social-emotional content. Further, the technological advances developed under this project will have applications in other fields, including adaptive learning, social media analytics, propaganda detection, and video summarization. \r\n\r\nOur multidisciplinary team of education and machine learning researchers will develop a content classification engine to identify mathematics content in online videos. We will define developmentally appropriate mathematics content at the toddler, preschool, and kindergarten levels based on the Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework and Common Core State Standards. To train the content classification engine, researchers who have demonstrated reliability in identifying the target mathematics content will annotate the mathematics content in 100 hours of online videos. The project\u2019s central research question asks, how accurately can the content classification engine identify early childhood mathematics content in videos, as compared to humans? To answer this, we will compare the mathematics content identified by TROVE to that identified by researchers in a set of videos that were not used to train the classification engine. We will share our findings with education technology researchers and developers, educators, and policymakers via a peer-reviewed journal article and blog post. TROVE has transformative potential to support young children\u2019s learning through exposure to high-quality, developmentally appropriate educational videos. Further, this technology may enable large-scale research on the impacts of children\u2019s exposure to educational and non-educational video content.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As young children have begun watching more online videos than television programs, it has become more difficult for parents and educators to identify high-quality, age-appropriate videos to support young children&rsquo;s learning. To help parents increase children&rsquo;s exposure to high-quality early math videos online, we developed a machine learning tool to automatically detect prekindergarten and kindergarten math content in online videos for young children, called Assisting Parents to Review Online Videos for Education, Prekindergarten and Kindergarten-Math (APPROVE PreK &amp; K-Math).

(1) How accurately can the machine learning model detect early math content in online videos? The machine learning model is 83% to 87% accurate in detecting early math content in online videos on average.

(2) How accurately can the machine learning model detect indicators of educational quality in online videos? The machine learning model demonstrated variable accuracy (27-95%) for detecting five indicators of educational quality, as compared to human annotators. Accuracy was highest for detecting videos whose purpose is to teach early math. This is unsurprising, as videos in this sample are screened to include early math content. By contrast, accuracy was lowest for detecting videos that use math to solve authentic problems. We find that few videos on YouTube use real-life problems to teach early math, so there were fewer examples of this quality indicator on which to train the model.
