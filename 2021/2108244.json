 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the nature of gravity at microscopic distances is one of the most important open problems in fundamental physics. Although General Relativity provides an extremely well-tested framework for describing gravitational effects at large distances, its connection with quantum mechanics and other fundamental interactions remains elusive.  Indeed, the development of a quantum theory of gravity that can be incorporated into the Standard Model of fundamental interactions is a central goal of physics, with broad implications for our understanding of particle physics and the mysterious nature of the \"dark energy\" that appears to permeate the universe. Many theories attempting to provide a consistent microscopic framework for gravity (e.g., those involving extra dimensions) predict that gravity could deviate from the familiar inverse square law at sub-millimeter distances. Such deviations are extremely difficult to measure experimentally due to the small strength of gravitation and the presence of residual electromagnetic interactions.  This grant funds the continuation of an experimental program in this area that has just started providing results.\r\n\r\nPrevious measurements at these distance scales have employed techniques derived from human-size devices in which mechanical springs are used as part of force sensors.  In the last few years, with the support of the NSF, the PI has developed a drastically new technique, using the light field of a laser to confine and measure the motion of micron-size quartz microspheres.  In the last year the first full search for deviations from the inverse square law in the 10 micron range has been completed.  While not yet competitive with the most sensitive measurements, this represents the first demonstration of the new technique that more directly measures forces at the range of interest, instead of extrapolating with objects that are larger than such range.  In addition to this, the systematics are expected to be very different from those of other measurements and there are indications that background force models will soon be within reach. Additionally, the new technique used has been found to have many other applications in other areas of fundamental as well as applied physics. In the first category are searches for millicharged particles or tests of neutrality of matter, while inertial navigation and vacuum technology are examples of the second.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nGravity is the most obvious of the fundamental interactions of Nature (after all, this is why we fall to the ground when we stumble!). Yet, at a fundamental level, it is also the interaction that we understand the least. In particular, we don't seem to have a proper way to reconcile gravity, as described by Einstein's general relativity, with quantum mechanics, the formalism describing Nature at the smallest scale. Ordinarily, these difficulties have minor consequences, as gravity is very weak and, at very short distance, the amount of mass that gravity can couple to is tiny. But, from a point of view of principle, it is rather unsettling that these two areas of physics, each tremendously successful by itself, don't work together.\nThis program continues to tackle the related issue of measuring the force of gravity at distances between 1 micron and 100 microns, to investigate whether its behavior still follows the inverse-square law known since the times of Newton. A result deviating from such a law could be interpreted as due to new, extra dimensions of space-time at short distance, or the emergence of new types of fundamental interactions. Either way, such a result would upend our understanding of the natural world, making this the kind of high risk, potentially revolutionary outcome program that the NSF is meant to support. In addition, this program is developing a novel technique to measure the force of gravity, a technique that can be applied to many other measurements in science and technology.\nIn the grant period that just concluded, the first paper searching for new, gravity-like forces at micron scale was accepted and published, as was a paper describing a new method to identify and remove background forces deriving from dipole interactions from residual electric field gradients. In the same period a very substantial effort was entertained to reduce noise in the force readout of the traps and backgrounds of optical origin. The result are two traps obtaining the lowest noise ever achieved in this area, and substantially reduced backgrounds for the measurement of forces requiring near-by attractors. Data taking towards better sensitivity for new forces is in progress. In addition, the excellent noise performance now possible will be exploited to further improve the sensitivity for very small differences in the absolute values of electrons and proton charges.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: GiorgioGratta\n"
