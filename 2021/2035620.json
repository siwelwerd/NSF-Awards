 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research SBIR Phase I project is that it will answer the quest for developing a new type of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft combining the competitive advantages of winged aircraft with those of helicopters.  Accordingly, this project will enable the production of a new type of VTOL aircraft that will be able to cruise at 640 mph; to operate at altitudes up to 35,000 feet; will be cheaper to build and maintain, easier to fly and less prone to accidents; and will provide the comfort and low noise level winged aircraft enjoy. These competitive advantages will make this new type of VTOL aircraft more attractive to Helicopter and Business Aircraft manufacturers and customers, which will boost the $55 Billion/year helicopter and business aircraft Industry.  In addition, this project will enable the production of small/medium-sized, electric, VTOL Aircraft for use in metropolitan areas, which will provide U.S. communities with a fast, convenient, low-noise means of transportation for use in metropolitan areas. \r\n\r\nThe current SBIR Phase I project aims at confirming the feasibility of an innovative lift-generating mechanism to enable the production of a new type of VTOL Aircraft. The lift-generating mechanism employs two novel components, a compound propeller having a cascade of specially-designed low angle-of-attack blades positioned in close proximity to one another, and an airflow pattern modifier. The feasibility of these two components was suggested with a multi-element airfoil CFD analysis tool, motivating the prototype proposed here.  This project will broaden our understanding of blades operating at low angle-of-attack and positioned in close proximity to one another. The main objectives of this project are to assess the performance of the compound propeller and the effect of using the airflow pattern modifiers on the performance; and to estimate the overall disc loading and hover lift efficiency of this proposed lift-generating mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The current research effort was undertaken to investigate the feasibility through experimental validation of an innovative lift-generating (LG) mechanism intended for use in future VTOL vehicles, which was believed to have some competitive advantages compared to currently in use technologies. The proposed LG mechanism configuration includes flow directing (FD) blades placed at strategic locations to increase the net thrust generated. A sub-scale technology demonstrator was designed, built, and tested. Following the experimental investigation, design optimization was performed leveraging CFD simulation, and the net thrust generated was increased by 3 to 5 times the initial design.</p>\n<p>The prototype assembly was tested at the North Carolina State University (NCSU) FREEDM Systems Center. The prototype was designed to enable investigating the performance of three main components of the LG mechanism individually and in combination with one another. The prototype was tested with several configurations to properly evaluate the value added to the LG mechanism by each of the three components. Collected performance data included values from sensor recordings (i.e., the load cell, the AC/DC Clamp Meter, AC/DC Multimeter, and Digital Sound Level Meter). Performance data was recorded at various blade tip speeds ranging between 180-270 meters/second. Collected raw data was processed and used to calculate the lift-generating mechanism?s disc loading, hover lift efficiency, and intensity of noise generated at various operating speeds for all the cases. The net thrust produced by the system was relatively lower than the initial predictions. It is believed that due to the negative camber of the FD blades, a force is produced downstream of the rotor blades. Consequently, the net thrust produced by the system is decreased as observed during the experiment.</p>\n<p>An effort was made by leveraging CFD analysis of the system to further understand the phenomena and to optimize the system. ANSYS Fluent was used to predict the flow conditions during the experiment. To model the rotating blades and the stationary duct, a frozen rotor in a moving reference frame approach was chosen. The methodology was validated by performing an analysis to the NACA 4-(3)(08)-03 propeller for which experimental values are available. Numerous designs including FD blades were analyzed. Although the net thrust was increased 3 to 5 times compared to the initial design, the FD blades had adverse effects on thrust on all designs considered. Therefore, the FD blades were disregarded moving forward.
