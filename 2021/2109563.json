 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Species are often affected by multiple human-created stressors simultaneously. However, disentangling the singular and additive effects of these human made stressors remains challenging. The fellow will use a technique called landscape genomics, which allows you to identify relationships between the environment and genetics of organisms, to build a model to understand the effect of human induced environmental change (urbanization, climate change) on a freshwater turtle, the Puerto Rican Slider, in Puerto Rico. This species is impacted by both habitat loss to urbanization and the spread of an invasive species, the red eared slider. Additionally, the fellow will facilitate community engagement at various levels. Firstly, the fellow will work with Puerto Rican science educators to facilitate the use of iNaturalist, which is an app used to discover, identify and report local biodiversity. Secondly, the fellow will facilitate training in molecular laboratory techniques for underrepresented high school students near the sponsoring institution in New York. Thirdly, the fellow will help connect students to graduate programs, fellowships, and professional opportunities through a Facebook group called Jicoteando created for this fellowship and also via various oral presentations.   \r\n\r\nThis research will require the application of population genomics, spatial analyses, and ecological studies. Thus, the fellow will be provided training in many new skills and in interdisciplinary work. The landscape genomics models will test the singular and additive contributions of biotic and abiotic factors in relation to the species\u2019 functional genetic connectivity. To accomplish this, the fellow will first sequence genomic DNA and then sample relevant landscape and ecological covariates across the study area. Covariates will then be transformed into resistance surfaces characterizing their permeability or resistance to the movement of genetic variation. This transformation will be used to contrast singular and additive resistances arising from the measured covariates. The fellow will build important collaborations with conservation agencies with the goal of writing a management plan for the species informed by the impacts of landscape features and hybridization. The fellow will also gain outreach experience working with students at various career stages.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Nearly half of the known turtle species are vulnerable to extinction. Yet, some species are heavily understudied.

In Puerto Rico, local conservation agencies are concerned that Red-eared Sldiers are competing with&nbsp; the native turtle and that the species are interbreeding resulting in hybrids.

Our genetic study confirmed the presence of hybrids and that these hybrids can reproduce with both species. The reproductive viability of hybrids suggests that conservation plans should consider preserving the genetic diversity of the Puerto Rican Slider.
