 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Christine Thomas at Ohio State University is studying the fundamental design of new, more sustainable, catalysts for hydrofunctionalization reactions. Catalytic hydrofunctionalization reactions provide an environmentally friendly method to convert widely available chemical feedstocks into synthetic intermediates that can easily be converted into value-added products with uses in pharmaceuticals, consumer products, and the commodity chemical industry. The project aims to uncover new catalysts that are easily produced from naturally abundant and inexpensive precursors, particularly taking advantage of Earth-abundant metals such as manganese, iron, and cobalt. This project is directly contributing to the rigorous training of both graduate students and undergraduate researchers in preparation for their careers as scientific researchers.  In efforts to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in chemistry, Professor Thomas serves as the faculty advisor to the student organization for women in chemistry at Ohio State (Females of Chemistry Uniting Scientists, FOCUS), is an active member of the NOBCChE (National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers) Collaborative, and will be launching a new summer undergraduate program in the Ohio State Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry specifically focused on providing research opportunities for underrepresented minority students (CoNQUER, Collaborative NOBCChE Quintessential Undergraduate Experience in Research).  \r\n\r\nWith the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Christine Thomas at Ohio State University is studying the design of new multidentate ligand frameworks in an effort to promote metal-ligand cooperativity with Earth-abundant first row transition metals (e.g., iron, cobalt, manganese).  The project aims to uncover more sustainable catalytic methods by using metal-ligand cooperative processes as a strategy to make and break chemical bonds without relying on two-electron redox cycles that are often inaccessible to first row metals. Ligand design is at the heart of this project, and the Thomas group is evaluating several different approaches in this regard.  A tridentate PPP-based pincer ligand featuring an N-heterocyclic phosphide fragment has been shown to actively participate in metal-ligand cooperative reactions in which sigma bonds are cleaved across the metal-phosphide linkage, and ongoing studies focus on the expansion of established stoichiometric reactions and their incorporation into catalytic cycles for the hydroboration, hydrogenation, and hydrosilylation of unsaturated substrates.  In addition, Thomas\u2019s research team is exploring a new tetradentate PNNP-based ligand that contains two amide donors as potential sites for metal-ligand cooperativity. The coordination of this ligand to Fe, Co, and Mn and the stoichiometric reactivity of the resulting (PNNP)M compounds towards the activation of substrates such as hydrogen, silanes, and boranes across the two metal-amide bonds is under investigation, with the ultimate goal of incorporating these fundamental reaction steps into catalytic hydrofunctionalization reactions. Lastly, a newly discovered metal-templated procedure for the elimination and substitution of phosphine substituents will be leveraged to synthesize an expanded family of ligands, including tetradentate ligand derivatives that feature both phosphide and amide donors as potential reactive sites, PPP- and PNNP-based ligands with more electron-rich alkyl substituents, and tridentate and tetradentate ligands with P-chiral functionalities for use in asymmetric catalysis. The new synthetic method will provide researchers in the field with a new economical and straightforward method to synthesize large families of multidentate ligand derivatives including P-chiral variants without the need for expensive precursors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Cataltyic hydrofunctionalization reactions provide an environmentally friendly method to convert widely available chemical feedstocks into value-added intermediates and products with uses in the pharmaceutical, consumer product, and commodity chemical industries. First row transition metals such as manganese, iron, and cobalt are cheapter and more Earth-abundant the &ldquo;precious metals&rdquo; (e.g. rhodium, iridium, palladium) that are more commonly used in catalysis, but their utility in catalysis is often limited by their reluctance to undergo multi-electron redox changes. The approach taken by the PI and her team was to design and develop new multidentate ligand frameworks that function cooperatively with the metal center to make and break chemical bonds without relying on the two-electron redox cycles that are often inaccessible to first row metals. During the course of this project, three different ligand designs were investigated. First, a tridentate (PPP)<sup>-/+</sup> pincer ligand featuring a central N-heterocyclic phosphide fragment was coordinated to Mn and the ligand was shown to undergo ambiphilic behavior exemplified by bond activation processes across the Mn-P bond (Figure 1). &nbsp;Bond activation across the metal-phosphorus bond in compounds of this type was also explored. Cobalt complexes bound to the neutral (PP<sup>H</sup>P) ligand were found to be active precatalysts for both alkene hydroboration and hydrogenation and, although a metal-ligand cooperative mechanism was initially hypothesized, the PI&rsquo;s team found that replacement of the H with even more tightly bound substituents such as CF<sub>3</sub> led to more robust and active hydroboration catalysts (Figure 2). Thus, rather than a metal-ligand cooperative mechanism, it is now believed that the central N-heterocyclic phosphine aids in catalysis via its strongly &pi;-accepting nature, prompting the synthesis of a large family of electronically differentiated ligands (Figure 3). The PI&rsquo;s team also explored a tetradentate bis(amido)bis(phosphine) ligand and its coordination to Fe and Co.&nbsp; The two amide donors of the ligand serve as effective sites for metal-ligand cooperativity, allowing stoichiometric activation of B-H, Si-H, and C-H bonds across the Fe-amide bonds of (PNNP)Fe, and a metal-ligand cooperative mechanism for catalytic alkyne dimerization was established (Figure 4). While the (PNNP)Co derivative did not undergo similar metal-ligand cooperative bond activation processes, it was found that the ligand could be converted to a redox-active form via post-metallation hydrogen atom abstraction reactions (Figure 5). &nbsp;These represent important breakthroughs in base metal catalysis and highlights the importance of ligand design in enabling catalytic transformations with first row metals. The NSF funded project resulted in 9 peer-reviewed publications detailing our extensive studies into the coordination chemistry, reactivity, and catalytic activities of metal complexes containing (PPP)<sup>-</sup>, (PPRP), and (PNNP)<sup>2-</sup> ligands.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project also contributed to the rigorous training of 8 Ph.D. students, 1 M.S. student, and 8 undergraduate researchers in laboratory skills as well as written and oral communication skills in preparation for their careers as scientific researchers. The broader impacts of this project included K-12 outreach and efforts to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in chemistry. The PI and members of her team participated in two annual outreach events held at OSU, Breakfast of Science Champions and WestFest, geared towards middle school students and families with young children in Columbus, OH (Figure 6). The PI served as the faculty advisor for a graduate student organization for women in chemistry at OSU, and participated in the NOBCChE Collaborative, a group of 6 institutions working together with the National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE) to increase the opportunities for the recruitment and retention of black chemists in academia. The PI organized and hosted the 2023 NOBCChE Collaborative Spring Meeting at Ohio State (Figure 6) and launched a new summer undergraduate research program (CoNQUER, Collaborative NOBCChE Quintessential Undergraduate Experience in Research) in the Ohio State University Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry specifically focused on providing research opportunities for students from HBCUs and NOBCChE Collaborative institutions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/25/2024<br>\nModified by: Christine&nbsp;M&nbsp;Thomas</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2101002/2101002_10730109_1729882166202_Figure_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2101002/2101002_10730109_1729882166202_Figure_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2101002/2101002_10730109_1729882166202_Figure_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">E-H bond activation across the Fe-amide bonds of (PNNP)Fe (E = C, Si) and incorporation of this reactivity into a catalytic cycle for alkyne dimerization.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Christine M.
