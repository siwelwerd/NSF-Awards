It is the first interdisciplinary symposium on this topic at an MRS Meeting, drawing on scientists with training in Materials Science, Chemistry, Physics, and Electrical Engineering. The two-day virtual symposium features 48 oral presentations, of which 29 are invited speakers. 11 of the invited speakers are female and 9 are untenured junior faculty or postdocs. Speakers are drawn from all over the world, including North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Support by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program and the Condensed Matter Physics program in the Division of Materials Research facilitates the participation of students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty.\r\n\r\nTechnical summary:\r\n\r\nIntermetallic compounds host a broad range of quantum, topological, and multiferroic phenomena, including chiral spin textures, Weyl and Dirac states, novel superconductivity, heavy fermion behavior, ferroelasticity, and magnetocaloric behavior. This diverse range of properties rivals that of the well-studied transition metal oxides; however, outstanding challenges remain in controlling stoichiometry and defects, fabricating atomically precise interfaces, and characterizing the fundamental electronic and magnetic structures. This symposium brings together experts to explore common themes across the various families of intermetallics, including Heusler compounds, lacunar spinels, Weyl semimetals, rare earth compounds, skyrmion compounds, and others. The symposium, support by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program and the Condensed Matter Physics program in the Division of Materials Research, highlights recent advances in bulk crystal and epitaxial film growth, advanced characterization, materials prediction/design, and new device concepts for intermetallic compounds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
