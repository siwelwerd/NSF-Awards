 "awd_abstract_narration": "Governor Mike DeWine allocated $12.1M through the Governors Emergency Education Relief (GEER) program to upgrade OARnet's last-mile internet connections to 40 smaller higher education institutions (HEI) through a unique opportunity. This funding is a result of growing reliance on cyberinfrastructure to support in-person and remote teaching and research. For smaller institutions, having access to additional advanced CI enriches existing programs while enabling new opportunities for research and training that rely on external, shared, and co-developed resources. To foster full use of new connectivity resources, OARnet and a team from nine smaller HEIs (Northwest State Community College, Chatfield College, Lorain County Community College, Terra State Community College, Franciscan University of Steubenville, Sinclair Community College, Columbus State Community College, Xavier University, Baldwin Wallace University), service providers (OSC and the CWRU Electron Microscopy Facility) supported by national entities (EPOC, The Quilt, InCommon/Internet2, Trusted CI), are planning two CC* proposals - 1. \"Regional Connectivity for Small Institutions of Higher Education\" track and 2. \"CI-Research Alignment\" track. \r\n\r\nThe regional proposal will develop statewide research and teaching DMZ and VPN networks and a federated identity management system for secure access to shared network-accessible resources in classrooms and labs. The CI-Research Alignment proposal will provide human infrastructure and processes needed to co-develop shared educational resources and curricula, such as interactive laboratory simulations and other virtual environments for STEM training that will also enhance the high school to higher education STEM pipeline (College Credit Plus Program.)\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Identify network-enabled education, training, and research applications and their requirements</p>\n<p>Key University programs and resources were identified which would benefit from federated identity services and enhanced network connectivity. These include the Case Western Reserve University electron microscope lab, the Ohio Supercomputer Center high performance compute and storage facilities, Kent State network research lab, and OhioLINK ? an innovative leader among library consortia. Additionally, OARnet engaged Columbus State Community College, Lorain Community College, Northwest State Community College, and Sinclair Community College in discussions regarding classroom technology used to extend the campus environment. Also, an Engagement and Performance Operations Center (EPOC) deep dive engagement at Sinclair Community College (SCC) was performed to provide insights for various data intensive applications and data flow.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;B. (i) Chart a course toward a statewide federated identity management system</p>\n<p>Engagement with InCommon/Internet2 to provide virtual InCommon BaseCamp workshops.</p>\n<p>OARnet conducted a Federated Identity Survey for the 10 Ohio schools and used the responses to inform content for the purposes of this workshop. OARnet approached Internet2 to help educate organizations about operating within the InCommon community/environment. A series of four workshops were developed for VROhio participants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>B. (ii) Chart a course toward DMZ/VPN network segments for sharing educational and research services</p>\n<p>A requirement for private network connectivity was identified between Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) to help facilitate high speed data transfers between the two locations. A private network was provisioned between CWRU and OSC across the OARnet backbone to facilitate the dedicated connectivity. This work built upon the existing physical 100G (CWRU) and 40G (OSC) network connections to OARnet with only software configurations. Future engagements with research communities throughout Ohio may reveal other unmet networking needs.</p>\n<p>During a larger community discussion on the VROhio project, a desire for dedicated non-production networking infrastructure in Ohio was indicated. Connectivity to the Internet2 R&amp;E network is typically shared with the campus Internet connection and mixed at the campus border. While this architecture enables Internet2 usage for all campus users ubiquitously, it fails to meet the needs as a ?disruptable/experimental network?. To address this gap, OARnet has proposed utilizing a 200G dedicated/redundant connection to Internet2 out of the total 400G connection. This new network is currently in the early stages of deployment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>C. Build a community to identify and encourage the development and adoption of shareable resources needed by under-resourced higher education institutions (HEIs)</p>\n<p>Fifty VROhio project participants, including Department Chairs, Educators, Researchers, Technical experts, System Administrators, Network and System Engineers, Administrators, and OARnet outreach and client services staff, participated in workgroup activities. Additional participants included subject matter experts from national organizations such as InCommon/Internet2 and EPOC/Energy Sciences Network (ESnet). This diverse group met regularly throughout the year to provide updates on activities, which led to rich discussions on current and future needs for institutions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>D. Engage national resources to assist in the development of internal operations at institutions to facilitate development of research capabilities</p>\n<p>Between October 2021 and March 2022, staff members from EPOC met with researchers and staff from Sinclair Community College and OARnet with the purpose of performing a Deep Dive into scientific and research drivers. The goal of this activity was to help characterize the requirements for several campuses use cases and to enable cyberinfrastructure support staff to better understand the needs of researchers in the community. This review included case studies from the following campus stakeholder groups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> GIS Education</li>\n<li>Automotive Education</li>\n<li>Unmanned Aerial Systems</li>\n<li>Automation &amp; Control of Robotics</li>\n<li>Cyber Security, Data Analytics, and Computer Science</li>\n<li>Information technology</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li> OARnet proposes to explore additional options for joining Federation, such as (1) aggregate purchasing agreements for Gateway/Bridge software into InCommon, (2) use of a separate, state-wide Federation which could be shared among 40 small and medium institutions in Ohio, and (3) using InCommon as a Federation framework for 40 small and medium institutions in Ohio, using an aggregation business model.</li>\n<li>While a significant effort will be required to enable Ohio research and education (R&amp;E) institutions to offer, utilize, and benefit from Federated identity services, we do see a path forward for identity management especially by creating a centralized pool of Cyberinfrastructure Engineers and aggregate purchasing mechanisms, thereby lowering the total cost of ownership, and increasing adoption.</li>\n<li>OARnet has proposed utilizing 200G out of the 400G Internet2 connection in Ohio for R&amp;E traffic and other experimental/disruptable traffic as a dedicated and redundant connection to Internet2, backed by dedicated optical transport and networking hardware in Ohio.
