 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyber SMART is one of the first IUCRC to strategically combine computer science (CS) and the related NSF social and economic sciences (SES) and behavioral and cognitive sciences (BCS) programs to cyber research. This multidisciplinary approach enables better understanding by industry, educators, students, and government of the impact of cyber. This comprehensive approach opens significant new and under-utilized avenues of enquiry, particularly at the intersection of CS, SES and BCS. The Center\u2019s unique skill-set significantly increases the depth and breadth of research available to organizations, the research and education opportunities available to academics and students in a range of disciplines, and informs policy, standards, and regulation. \r\n\r\nCyber SMART\u2019s CS expertise covers distributed ledger technology and standards, secure information systems, artificial intelligence (AI), including neuroscience and neurotech, cybersecurity and secure communications, post-quantum cybersecurity, finance/economics, business management, digital identity, cyber law/regulation, policy, psychology, and ethics.  Across the Center, each Site has specific, complementary expertise. While all Sites have strong CS, SES, and BCS capability, each site has leading expertise in specific areas. For example, the University of Notre Dame is known for its expertise in crime investigation and national security; digital ledger technology, biometrics anti-spoofing and bio ethics, and its leading expertise in human cognition and behavior complements and supplements the capabilities of other Sites. \r\n\r\nCyber SMART is uniquely positioned to produce research that comprehensively addresses the consequences of increased digitization. In broader impact, the Center\u2019s work will benefit industry, individuals who use products and services, educators and scholars, regulators, and society in general.  Applying CS, with relevant SES and BCS expertise enables comprehensive understanding of all the issues, better framing of research, and development of targeted and feasible solutions. Most importantly, new cross-discipline collaboration will bring innovation in education and training and greater inclusion. The Center\u2019s industry engagement and outreach is specifically designed to engage women, girls, and underrepresented minorities for career motivation, training and employment.  \r\n\r\nCyber SMART will maintain a Center-wide project repository including research data, code, results, emulators, simulators, scientific papers, etc., for at least three years after the end of the IUCRC. The Center lead site at Georgetown University has an institutional repository that will outlast the life of the IUCRC.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
