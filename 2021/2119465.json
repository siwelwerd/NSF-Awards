 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nThe geoscience learning community will help students from historically excluded communities build their STEM identity through authentic research experience, mentoring, and introduction to geosciences careers. Students will learn about air pollution, gain experience with instrumentation, practice computer programing and data analysis, and communicate scientific results by participating in real research with prosocial impact. This project addresses three GEOPAths Program goals: (1) increase the number and diversity of students in geosciences; 2) prepare students for geoscience careers; and 3) contribute to the evidence base for effective student engagement, learning, and retention in STEM. The data collected through this project will be of sufficient quality to contribute to community discussions about how best to reduce air pollution and better protect public health, particularly within vulnerable communities.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to employ several established evidence-based strategies for the success of students from historically excluded communities. A focus on student success in STEM will include authentic collaborative undergraduate research experiences, sustained mentorship, and engagement in research with a direct link to community benefit. By combining authentic prosocial research and mentoring, the PIs aim to build a sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and STEM identity in two cohorts of students and help with their successful transitions to STEM programs related to the earth sciences. This project specifically proposes to create geoscience learning community that engages undergraduate students from historically excluded communities in research to measure and attribute air pollution in two Chicago neighborhoods that differ in socioeconomic status, demographics, and proximity to industrial facilities. The PIs will recruit a cohort of undergraduate participants at Loyola to join a research-intensive learning community each of Year 1 and Year 2 of the project. Student participants will work closely with scientists and the community-based organizations to design and carry out research that addresses community concerns about air pollution. The Project's aims are to 1) provide an applied, socially relevant research experience for student participants; 2) understand how particulate pollution in Chicago varies over space and time; and 3) provide air quality data for community use.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

CARE engaged 16 Loyola undergraduate students, eight in 2022 and eight in 2023, to study air pollution in Chicago neighborhoods. Through seminars, field trips, and a four-week summer research intensive, students learned about and conducted socially relevant research while exploring career opportunities in geosciences.</p>\n<p>The 16 CARE participants came from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds (Figure 1), contributing to increased diversity in the geosciences. CARE fostered a supportive learning community in which students gained authentic research experiences and developed essential career skills. As a result, participants reported increased science identity (Figure 2), greater confidence in scientific skills (Figure 3), and improved collaborative skills (Figure 4).</p>\n<p>CARE expanded air quality monitoring in Chicago neighborhoods. Research conducted by CARE participants documented that:</p>\n<p class=\"zfr3q\">1. Air quality improvement in Chicago is not equal, with the south side seeing less improvement than the north side.</p>\n<p class=\"zfr3q\">2. Fine particle pollution (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) remains a real concern for Chicago residents, with occasional spikes in pollution levels that pose health risks. Wildfires elsewhere aggravate this concern.</p>\n<p class=\"zfr3q\">3. Traffic is a major source of fine particle pollution in Chicago. Residents living within 450 feet of busy roads should be alerted of the potential health impacts of air pollution.</p>\n<p class=\"zfr3q\">4. Greater efforts are needed to track and address the unequal air pollution burden in Southeast Chicago.</p>\n<p class=\"zfr3q\">Out of the 16 CARE participants, 12 have expressed interest in applying for graduate programs, and among the eight who have already graduated from Loyola, five have been accepted into graduate schools, including one PhD candidate. Additionally, seven students obtained competitive summer research positions with organizations such as the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates program, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Glacier Institute. The project findings have been disseminated through conference presentations (Figures 5 and 6), shared with community partners, published in peer-reviewed journal articles, and included in a public air quality database.</p>\n<p>CARE also supported two female graduate students, one specializing in environmental justice and the other in atmospheric science. These graduate students not only supported undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds but also enhanced their teaching and mentoring skills in both formal and informal settings. One of them has since pursued a PhD degree in environmental sociology, while the other has been hired by the US EPA Region 5 office to support their air sensor monitoring program.</p>\n<p>CARE has not only made a notable contribution to diversifying the workforce in geosciences but also demonstrated strong potential for sustainability and growth. It has been integrated into several undergraduate courses at Loyola such as <em>Energy and the Environment</em>, <em>Climate Change</em>, <em>Data Science Consulting</em>, and <em>Science and Society</em>. Through these courses, nearly 60 additional undergraduate students have participated in service-learning projects benefiting Chicago communities. Moving forward, CARE will expand to include Chicago middle school teachers, through a collaboration with the Center for Science and Math Education, supported by funding from the Schreiber Venture Foundation in 2024&ndash;2025.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/22/2024<br>\nModified by: Ping&nbsp;Jing</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2119465/2119465_10753958_1727450083184_Picture2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2119465/2119465_10753958_1727450083184_Picture2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2119465/2119465_10753958_1727450083184_Picture2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Average self-reported gains in identification as scientists among CARE participants (n=15).
