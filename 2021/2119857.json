 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nThe WaterCorps program will build an experiential learning pathway that emphasizes workforce development in the geosciences.  Students will engage in a professional learning community that provides a parallel environment to real-world, project-based work settings, such as the environmental consulting industry.  The unique structure of the program enables students to gain geoscience-related technical skills while also developing soft skills needed for success in industry (e.g., project management and client engagement).  Students in the WaterCorps program will support a regional needs gap in Eastern North Carolina for activities ranging from environmental site investigations to education and outreach activities for a wide range of community partners. A well-trained geoscience workforce is critical to tackle the important water quality and quantity issues faced by this economically disadvantaged region. WaterCorps students will develop their skills using a problem-based learning approach that will make them well suited to joining the environmental geoscience workforce in eastern North Carolina.  The structure of the project is also designed, however, to introduce students to business processes and build professional identity, thereby creating a pathway to experiential learning for those who might not otherwise take part in a cocurricular experiential learning experience, such as traditional research.  \r\n\r\nThe WaterCorps program is based on theories of interest and identity development.  As opposed to undergraduate research experiences, which are known to be highly successful in moving students towards graduate school and research careers, this project's main goal focuses on building professional identity and preparing students for the workforce, particularly areas related to environmental/coastal geosciences and environmental consulting. The WaterCorps organization will build student teams consisting of a project manager, staff scientists, interns, and general participants to address real-world problems posed by community partners in a consulting-style context.  External project partners range from State government agencies to non-governmental organizations and local community groups addressing a wide range of water-related problems.  Students will obtain technical geoscience experience and build soft skills that are needed in the workforce (e.g., project management, client communication, time management and task prioritization, and personnel skills).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
