 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). \r\n\r\nDigital technologies have become an essential asset in counterterrorism as they facilitate surveillance practices such as profiling, biometrics, or real-time monitoring. However, few empirical sociolegal studies have examined how digital technologies and experts materialize suspicion and produce digital evidence of terrorism. This doctoral dissertation project investigates how digital data is interpreted and mobilize as evidence of terrorism across different fields of expertise. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student, the project widely disseminates its data and findings through presentations, publications, lectures, and public meetings, thereby improving the public's understanding of science and the scientific method as is pertains to sociolegal and evidentiary analysis. \r\n\r\nThis doctoral dissertation research investigates whether the utilization of digital evidence through expert practices changes the way terrorism and counterterrorism are understood. This project asks three central questions: What constitutes digital evidence of terrorism? How digital entities materialize suspicion of terrorism? What happens to counterterrorism practices when interacting with new forms of evidence through digital technology? The researcher explores these questions through an ethnographic investigation of courts, terrorism researchers, digital forensics forums, firms, and discussions. The researcher also conducts archival research based on news articles, social media posts, and legal documents. Using a range of ethnographic techniques of data collection and analysis (including interviews, participant observation, and archival analysis), the researcher tracks what considerations turn digital data into evidence. The resulting research products contribute to scientific debates about terrorism, suspicion, digital data, evidence-making, and expertise.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This research examines what constitutes digital and non-digital evidence of terrorism. Focusing on the lives and works of experts who inhabit the intersection of science and law, it investigates narratives, practices, and technologies that shape legal facts and their political/cultural implications. The key outcomes of the research can be grouped into three clusters.&nbsp;<br />(1) This research suggests that the digitization of legal practices through the National Judiciary Informatics System (UYAP) and its videoconferencing module (Seg-Bis) have transformed the way the law is practiced in Turkey. While it has accelerated legal processes and decreased costs, UYAP has increased the authority of the Ministry of Justice over jurisprudence. In addition, the system functions as a surveillance mechanism since all legal information flows into a central database operated by the ministry of justice. Regarding terrorism trials, the system stores all testimonies, expert reports, and legal documents in a single database. Establishing such a digital database enables &ldquo;effortless&rdquo; data retrieval and document exchange, which allowed the judiciary and the police department to prosecute more than a million people through terrorism accusations. In other words, the system served as a critical infrastructure that has made possible mass-scale terrorism trials in the country.<br />Secondly, these technologies have produced a politically conservative setting in which the processes of justice have become less accessible to the majority of society. For example, videoconferencing (Seg-Bis) has enabled judges to send prisoners to incarceration centers far away from the cities where the trials are held. In terrorism trials, the co-pi frequently observed defendants being forced to participate in their hearings from prison via Seg-Bis. Also, judges often employed Seg-Bis in trials where government workers were accused of committing violence against civilians. The lawyer informants underscore that videoconferencing has become a way of preventing face-to-face confrontation between conflicting parties, especially in political trials. Third, as daily legal practices have become feasible online and remotely, corporeal elements of evidence are mediated and, at times, obscured by state-controlled electronic technologies. For example, in some hearings, it was impossible to see the faces of the bodies of witnesses/defendants on the Seg-Bis screen. The displacement of human bodies from the courtrooms decreases the role of sensory elements in legal knowledge-making.<br />(2) This research uncovers the institutionalization process of forensics sciences in Turkey since the 1980s and the emergence of a new form of forensics expertise. First, we identify a paradoxical situation. In the 1980s and 90s, while the Forensics Institute&rsquo;s technological and organizational capacity increased through significant investments, it became a center of public debate due to the controversial expert reports prepared for the legal cases where state officials were accused of committing violence. As multiple experienced practitioners emphasized in oral history interviews, during the 1980s and 90s, policymakers have re-constructed the forensics field &ldquo;as a state territory.&rdquo; As a result, legal evidencing was reconfigured as &ldquo;a state science,&rdquo; which prevents or intimidates other public actors from participating in evidence practices. Secondly, and in response to the former, a new mode of evidencing has emerged through the practices of the new generation in the 1990s. Unlike their teachers, who describe themselves as mere reporters of facts and limit their practices to the explanation of &ldquo;technical&rdquo; aspects of cases, the new forensics students have started to take sides and write &ldquo;alternative reports&rdquo; to hold state officials accountable for their actions. I suggest that this new generation has redefined objectivity and expertise by collaborating with people outside their discipline and complicating the boundaries that demarcate the territories of law and science.<br />(3) The project illuminates the production processes of &ldquo;digital evidence of terrorism&rdquo; within the context of post-2015 Turkey. State officials contend that digital evidencing is the safest way to identify &ldquo;religious putschists&rdquo; who disguise themselves with different identities, such as secular, leftist, or supporter of the president. Most of the evidence against alleged terrorists has consisted of traces of communication signals, social media posts, use of encrypted message applications, or digital data stored in personal networked devices and surveillance databases. Government officials and experts transformed these traces into signs that, allegedly impartially, index facts related to terrorism. Nonetheless, matching digital/surveillance records with actual persons is challenging and has created unpredictable consequences beyond the legal worlds. In most cases, it was impossible to ensure who or what produced these suspicious digital data due to the lack of technological infrastructure or the slipshod records of internet service providers. Given this intractable uncertainty, I argue that, rather than producing reliable information about past activities, these new evidence-making practices have created an extremely volatile terrain where both makers and targets of counter-terror feel more vulnerable and precarious.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/27/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Onur&nbsp;Arslan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
