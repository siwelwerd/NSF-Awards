 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on the development of a polarization-based 3D scanner that is capable of scanning all types of surfaces. Most existing commercial products are designed to scan matte surfaces, leaving specular/shiny surfaces difficult to scan. The proposed polarization-based 3D scanning technology is able to solve this shortcoming of 3D scanning by allowing the scanning of arbitrary surfaces. This technology may improve conventional 3D scanning products as it results in a low-cost and easy-to-use solution. In addition, this technology is expected to significantly broaden the application field of 3D scanning and benefit the business sectors that have high demand in 3D virtualization, including manufacturing, healthcare, architecture, entertainment, and digital media. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of polarization-based 3D scanning technology. This technology uses a novel smartly coded illumination, namely the polarization field, for 3D scanning. Core research and development includes: 1) identifying the material composition of scanning surfaces; 2) automatically adjusting scanning hardware settings, based on the detected surface material; and 3) achieving high-quality 3D reconstruction regardless of the shape and material of the subject. The proposed prototype may be constructed with inexpensive and easily accessible components, such as liquid crystal displays. The proposed technology is low-cost and user-friendly as it eliminates the need for manually switching the scanning mode to adapt to different types of surfaces. The resulted polarization-based 3D scanner is able to produce high quality 3D models of arbitrary surfaces, from purely diffuse to highly specular, with robust performance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, we have explored possible commercialization paths for our proposed 3D scanning system and improved the performance of our systems by incorporating new designs. We have attended the one-month I-Corps Cohort in January 2021 and interviewed around 100 potential partners or customers in different business sectors. We have also followed up with several contacts afterwards. On the technical side, we have designed and developed a polarization-based system to improve the accuracy and robustness of our system.  This aims to overcome the challenges associated with reconstructing 3-D point cloud.  A light source of the system generates light that is received by a polarization field generator of the system.  The polarization field generator generates a polarization field that illuminates the target object being imaged such that each outgoing ray has a unique polarization state.  A camera of the system captures images of the illuminated target object.  The captured images are received by a processor of the system that: (1) performs a polarization field decoding algorithm that decodes the polarization field to obtain a set of incident rays; (2) performs a camera ray decoding algorithm to obtain a set of camera rays; (3) performs a ray-ray intersection algorithm that determines intersection points where the incident rays and the camera rays intersect; and (4) performs a 3-D reconstruction algorithm that uses the set of incident rays, the set of camera rays and the intersection points to reconstruct a 3-D point cloud of the target object.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/10/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bijaya B Karki"
