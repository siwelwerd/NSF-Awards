 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a robotic control that uses air. Rather than controlling robotic systems with microcontrollers and motors, the proposed technology controls commercial robotic platforms with air using minimal electronics. The control approach has not been used in a commercial robotic product to date but may decrease the manufacturing and assembly costs of commercial robotic systems while maintaining or expanding the capabilities of robots.  Initially, the pneumatic components will be used to control a robotic toy as a commercially-viable stepping-stone for powering and controlling commercial robotic systems with pneumatic circuits.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of pneumatic memory elements to control the movement of robots with air.  The robots move by pumping air through channels and embedded air-powered valves. Traditional robots require a motor to control every actuated joint while the proposed technology only requires one pressure source, such as a pump, to control multiple movements.  Recently published results demonstrate the use of air-powered circuits inspired by neural circuits found in animals, called central pattern generators, to control the rhythmic motions of a walking robot without using electronics. The robot was equipped with valves acting as inverters that cause a high-pressure state to spread throughout an air-powered circuit. The robot also was equipped with simple pressure-activated mechanical sensors to change the movement of the robotic appendages. The goal is to transfer this soft robotic technology into a commercially viable product.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
