 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Valerie Pierre of the University of Minnesota will be developing a new class of three-dimensional precision polymers. The unique wireframe topology of these hollow polymers opens up new possibilities for a number of applications including their potential use as solubilizing agents, as molecular and imaging probes, and as encapsulating and delivery agents. Broader impacts of the project include the development and evaluation of new hands-on activities to engage grade six students in science with the goal of improving their attitude and increasing their interest toward science early in their education.\r\n\r\nIn this project, Dr. Valerie Pierre and her team will engage in a focused study directed ad the development of a class of three-dimensional wireframe polymers.  A unique aspect of the wireframe polymers is their templated synthesis. The approach employs predictive supramolecular strategies to template the position of each monomer on a DNA nanostructure. Subsequent coupling of the monomers yields the final desired macromolecule in one pot.  The modularity of the templated approach will facilitate tuning of the polymer\u2019s size, topology, and functional groups to match the needs of the intended applications. Orthogonal conjugation chemistry will enable functionalization of a large yet precise number of groups on the wireframe polymer. The modularity of the supramolecular approach will enable the facile introduction of a set number of a second and distinct monomers at precise and predetermined locations on the macromolecules. The ability to pinpoint and efficiently incorporate single monomer polymorphism opens the door to precise bifunctional polymers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
