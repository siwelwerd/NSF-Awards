 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrodes exist in many of our pockets and briefcases (e.g., at either pole of a lithium-ion battery).

Our plan is to bring newly developed, realistic structural models and several samples of pristine ZTCs to the Dinc\u0103 laboratory to carry out combined experimental and theoretical investigations of electrical conductivity and related electrochemical properties of porous framework solids. A primary goal of this work will be to ascertain the mechanism of charge transport within the metal-free carbon framework of ZTCs, and subsequently tailor new MOFs and ZTCs with both high electrical conductivity and ion storage capacity. These studies will shed new insight into the rational design of capacitive electrode materials for next-generation energy storage applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
