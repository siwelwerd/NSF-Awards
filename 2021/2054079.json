 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative research, approaches and resources for use in a variety of settings.  In this exploratory Change Makers project, the Concord Consortium will develop, test, and evaluate a citizen science program that leverages innovative technology, such that youth engage directly with energy issues through scientific inquiry.  The project will create the Infrared Street View, a citizen science program that aims to produce a thermal version of Google's Street View using an affordable infrared camera attached to a smartphone. The infrared camera serves as a high-throughput data acquisition instrument that collects thousands of temperature data points each time a picture is taken. Youth will collect massive geotagged thermal data that have considerable scientific and educational value for visualizing energy usage and improving energy efficiency at all levels. The Infrared Street View program will provide a Web-based platform for youth and anyone interested in energy efficiency to view and analyze the aggregated data to identify possible energy losses. By sharing their scientific findings with stakeholders, youth will make changes to the way energy is being used. The project will start with school, public, and commercial buildings in selected areas where performing thermal scan of the buildings and publishing their thermal images for educational and research purposes are permitted by school leaders, town officials, and property owners. In collaboration with high schools and out-of-school programs in Massachusetts, this project will conduct pilot-tests with approximately 200 students. \r\n\r\nTo contribute to advancing learning, the study will probe three research questions: 1) Under what circumstances can technology bridge out-of-school and classroom science learning and improve learning on both sides? 2) To what extent can unobtrusive assessment based on data mining support research and evaluation of student learning in out-of-school settings? and 3) To what extent can instructional intelligence built into the app used in the program help students learn in out-of-school programs and improve the quality of data they contribute to the citizen science project? Data sources for investigating these questions include students' interaction data with the app logged behind the scenes and the images they have taken, as well as results based on traditional assessments from a small number of participants. Throughout the project, staff will widely disseminate project products and findings through the Internet, science fairs, conferences, publications, and partner networks. An eight-member Advisory Board consisting of cleantech experts, science educators, and educational researchers will oversee and evaluate this project.",

In terms of development, the project has produced three open-source software programs: Infrared Explorer (https://intofuture.org/ie.html), Telelab (https://intofuture.org/telelab.html), and Infrared Street View (https://intofuture.org/isv.html), which are freely available for anyone to use. In particular, Telelab supports remote science investigations, providing a valuable solution to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or other natural disasters that may prevent students from attending in-person learning. In terms of research, the project has published more than ten papers in peer-reviewed academic journals in the field of science education and educational technology. Importantly, the project has also developed learning analytics that can track, visualize, and analyze students' individual and collective behaviors, allowing educators to monitor a group of students in classroom or out-of-school settings and leading to \"instructional intelligence\" that may offload educators' instructional burdens in guiding complex learning. In terms of dissemination, the project has provided professional development webinars to dozens of science teachers across the country. In particular, Telelab has been used by more than 500 students and educators (as registered users) and will continue to serve more in the years to come.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/09/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Charles&nbsp;Xie</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2054079/2054079_10515620_1652122700317_ie-samples--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2054079/2054079_10515620_1652122700317_ie-samples--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Infrared Explorer in action\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2054079/2054079_10515620_1652122700317_ie-samples--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Infrared Explorer in action\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Using a thermal camera connected to a smartphone, the Infrared Explorer can be used to study many interesting science phenomena.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Charles Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Charles&nbsp;Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Infrared Explorer in action</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2054079/2054079_10515620_1652122818199_children-museum--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2054079/2054079_10515620_1652122818199_children-museum--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Infrared Street View: Boston Children Museum\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2054079/2054079_10515620_1652122818199_children-museum--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Infrared Street View: Boston Children Museum\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An infrared panorama of Boston Children's Museum in a hot summer day shows the temperature distribution that may reveal urban heat.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Charles Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Charles&nbsp;Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Infrared Street View: Boston Children Museum</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2054079/2054079_10515620_1652122972737_isv-navigation-arrows--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2054079/2054079_10515620_1652122972737_isv-navigation-arrows--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Navigation in Infrared Street View\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2054079/2054079_10515620_1652122972737_isv-navigation-arrows--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Navigation in Infrared Street View\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Embedded arrows in Infrared Street View allows the user to navigate around to explore the thermal views of streets in a city.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Charles Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Charles&nbsp;Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Navigation in Infrared Street View</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2054079/2054079_10515620_1652123098700_telelab-remote-control-thermography--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2054079/2054079_10515620_1652123098700_telelab-remote-control-thermography--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Remote Control of Infrared Thermography via Telelab\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2054079/2054079_10515620_1652123098700_telelab-remote-control-thermography--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Remote Control of Infrared Thermography via Telelab\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Telelab platform allows users to control infrared thermography remotely via the Internet.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Charles Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Charles&nbsp;Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Remote Control of Infrared Thermography via Telelab</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
