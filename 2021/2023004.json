 "awd_abstract_narration": "HBCU-RISE: An interdisciplinary Graduate Certificate in Bioimaging and Biophotonics to Strengthen Research and Doctoral Training\r\n\r\nThe Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (HBCU-RISE) program supports the development of research capability at Historically Black Colleges and Universities that offer doctoral degrees in science and engineering disciplines. Supported projects have a unifying research focus in a research area supported by the National Science Foundation, a direct connection to the long-term plans of the host department, institutional strategic plan and mission, and plans for expanding institutional research capacity, as well as increasing the production of doctoral students, especially those underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. \r\n\r\nWith National Science Foundation support, Delaware State University will establish an interdisciplinary Graduate Certificate Program in Bioimaging and Biophotonics to enhance the education and training of doctoral students at Delaware State University. The unifying research focus for the project is the integration of bioimaging and biophotonics. Five interdisciplinary research projects are offered for HBCU RISE PhD students. Faculty research capacity is enhanced by funding doctoral students and supporting students\u2019 interdisciplinary training in neuroscience and optics. The vision of this project is to increase the number of underrepresented scientists in the interdisciplinary field of bioimaging and biophotonics. \r\n\r\nThis HBCU-RISE project focuses on the technological development of optical technology and techniques. This interdisciplinary project combines modern optical imagining theory and development with their potential applications in molecular and cellular systems. The integration of imaging and science may potentially transform a broader understanding of these systems and have biomedical implications.  This project will: (1) advance interdisciplinary research and promote faculty productivity; (2) focus on graduate education providing four fellows per year mentored by an interdisciplinary team from life sciences/physics/optics or computational sciences; (3) establish a doctoral-level certificate program; (4) and revise one course and create two new courses focusing on the application of tools and analysis techniques.\r\n\r\nThis project leverages existing resources to provide new pathways for Delaware State University students to participate in research. The project broadens the scope of the existing doctoral program, making it accessible to students from a wider range of disciplines and by transforming the program into a more comprehensive multidisciplinary research program that will prepare students for an increasingly competitive research environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
