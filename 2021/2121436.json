 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by expanding the capacity of the Center for Infrastructure Transformation and Education (CIT-E) to support civil, construction, and environmental engineering faculty members in their efforts to integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) into infrastructure education. The causes of inequitable infrastructure are many; however, given its leading role in infrastructure-related education and research, the civil and environmental engineering (CEE) faculty has an obligation to recognize and address the need for systemic change. Historically, CEE faculty members have not received formal training on DEI issues. While such training is becoming more common, a gap remains. This Level 1 Capacity Building project will support CIT-E, an existing and thriving community of practice (CoP), through providing the foundation for future work in developing a multi-institutional effort to transform the CEE education community into a community that can sustain growth in DEI integration. The collaborative research project is a joint effort by the University of Wisconsin, Platteville, Lafayette College, Colorado State University, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.\r\n\r\nWith the increased capacity generated by this expanded network and a shared vision, the CIT-E CoP work will be transformative.  Leveraging the CIT-E and the CoP, the project frames the work through the lens of two continua: race neutral/race conscious and inclusion infrastructure/exclusion infrastructure.  This project will develop i) CIT-E communal understanding of how DEI and infrastructure are related; ii) what the interaction among members reveals about DEI; iii) how members of the CoP can educate one another by addressing DEI issues in education, research, and professional practice; and iv) how the CoP can inspire real and lasting change.  Specifically, this project will increase the capacity of CIT-E through the following project objectives: i) gather evidence by compiling a list of non-normative examples of successful institutional efforts that positively impact DEI; ii) assess CIT-E resources and needs via Asset Mapping; iii) evaluate Community of Practice as an appropriate Change Theory; iv) recruit additional stakeholders and organizations to CIT-E based on the gaps identified in previous project objectives; v) identify, cluster, and prioritize ways of integrating DEI into CEE education using Group Concept Mapping (GCM); and vi) provide the foundation for developing  a multi-institutional effort to transform the CEE education community into a community that can sustain growth in DEI integration.  The Research Team will ensure that key stakeholders, including experts in Change Theory, DEI strategies, and curriculum development are invited to provide external peer review of the project.   The Research Team will facilitate working sessions to address larger tasks such as GCM and Asset Mapping. Through a collaboration with the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences (IRISS), the project will i) build the capacity of the geographically-dispersed Research Team by accelerating the team\u2019s integration to operate as a highly-functioning team and ii) explore how Team Science might add value to efforts to expand the work.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\r\n\n\nThis project has laid the groundwork for a more community-conscious approach to engineering education and practice by expanding the Center for Infrastructure Transformation and Education (CIT-E). CIT-E is a dynamic community of practice (CoP) that is taking collective responsibility for transforming higher education by developing support infrastructure to integrate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) into civil and environmental engineering (CEE) education. This NSF-supported project aimed to build the capacity of CIT-E to increase the potential for transformation through asset mapping, critical reflection, knowledge sharing, and strategic doing for systemic change. Through CIT-E, educators can collaboratively develop, critique, and adapt resources and methods to equip undergraduate students who will be the future engineers responsible for designing unifying infrastructure addressing DEI considerations across communities. Particular focus is given to infrastructure projects, which have historically divided communities perpetuating systemic inequities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nThe CIT-E CoP is transforming infrastructure education by organizing educators and connecting support resources beyond institutional barriers to improve the civil infrastructure curriculum. The Community of Practice change theory has been reviewed, validated, and operationalized as applicable in the context of infrastructure education. The project has developed a systematic literature review and associated public Zotero database that critically analyzes the current status of published work in this area. Through Group Concept Mapping and collaboration with experts, the CIT-E team identified and prioritized DEI issues relevant to CEE and developed two new lessons for the model introductory infrastructure course that frame infrastructure as a socio-technical system. These lessons are rooted in real-world cases that illuminate the consequences of historical inequitieslike those seen in the Flint water crisis and exclusionary urban designs by figures like Robert Moses. Faculty members across multiple institutions have engaged in CIT-E workshops and online forums to co-create and adapt these materials, impacting more than 4,000 students across the U.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nCIT-Es broader impact is evident in its empowerment of a diverse faculty and student community. By fostering a robust DEI-focused infrastructure curriculum, CIT-E is preparing students to address systemic issues in public infrastructure. As part of its ongoing mission, CIT-E hosted public forums, workshops, and group concept mapping sessions to engage a wide range of faculty, DEI advocates, and engineering professionals. These sessions allowed participants to share challenges, identify resource needs, and discuss DEI priorities in CEE education. Notably, the research teams efforts have broadened the CoPs reach and enhanced its diversity, drawing in early-career faculty, a wider range of institutional representation, faculty from underrepresented backgrounds in engineering, and DEI specialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nKey Outcomes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnhanced CoP Capacity and Resources: The research team expanded CIT-E's capacity through asset mapping and stakeholder recruitment. New resources, including instructional modules and networking tools, were developed and made accessible via a shared Canvas platform. A comprehensive online infrastructure for collaboration, backed by a digital marketing strategy, improved CIT-Es outreach and usability.\r\nCollaborative DEI Curriculum Development: Through Group Concept Mapping, faculty identified and prioritized DEI topics. As a result of CIT-E workshops, faculty members have created lesson plans, case studies, and curricula that address issues such as race-neutral exclusion in infrastructure. These materials empower faculty to teach infrastructure as a social-technical system and prepare students to tackle inequalities in future projects.\r\nIncreased Faculty Engagement and Professional Development: The research team held Team Science workshops to foster skills in collaborative writing, communication, and leadership. CIT-E also offered six national summer workshops that equipped faculty with tools for interdisciplinary teaching and strengthened the CoPs cohesion. These workshops also highlighted the value of DEI as central to equitable infrastructure education.\r\nImpact on Student Learning and Faculty Knowledge: More than 100 active members from more than 30 institutions have participated in CIT-Es activities, reaching thousands of students. This DEI-centric curriculum is preparing the next generation of engineers to consider the long-term social impacts of infrastructure, thereby addressing public health, environmental justice, and equity in their future work.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/26/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RodolfoValdes Vasquez\n"
