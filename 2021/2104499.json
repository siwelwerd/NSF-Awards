 "awd_abstract_narration": "PART 1:   NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis project uses direct measurements of molecular interactions to inform the development of polymers to penetrate the mucosal barrier. Mucus provides a barrier to protect tissue from invasion by bacteria, viruses, allergens, and irritants. Interestingly, transmucosal drug delivery is a promising alternative to other more invasive methods as it has good patience compliance and is able to target particular organs while offering improved drug bioavailability. The success of mucosal delivery methods thus requires highly sensitive measurements to inform materials synthesis strategies. This collaborative project will use total internal reflection microscopy experiments to directly measure interactions between mucus films and particles coated with zwitterionic polymers. Zwitterionic polymers are those that carry an equal number of positive and negative charges, similar to lipids present on the surfaces of cells. The team uses these measurements, which provide nanometer-scale resolution, to inform of the interactions between chemically different zwitterionic polymers and mucus, and to extract the importance of polymer chemistry on mucopenetrability. Educational impacts of this work are focused on training of students at graduate and undergraduate levels. Efforts to retain undergraduate underrepresented minorities are undertaken through mentoring for student members of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities. Outreach activities center on involvement in recruiting activities and summer research opportunities for undergraduates through The Colorado-Wyoming Alliance for Minority Participation (CO-WY AMP). Focus is also placed on hosting undergraduate students in the laboratory and to participate in K-5 STEM education via the SABES (STEM Achievement in Baltimore Elementary Schools) program. \r\n\r\nPART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis research centers around the development of zwitterionic polymers and particles with controllable mucopenetration. To understand carrier-mucus interactions and mucus transport, we propose a series of coupled aims which integrate synthetic biomaterials design of polymers will well-defined molecular characteristics and the direct kT-scale measurements of their mucus interactions and mucus transport. Control over molecular properties, including zwitterion dipole orientation and molecular weight, will enable us to carry out a comprehensive examination of the effects of these characteristics on their performance as effective mucopenetrating drug carriers. Simultaneously, by employing Total Internal Reflection Microscopy (TIRM) we will directly and non-intrusively measure kT and nanometer scale interactions between particles and mucus, with and without boronic acid targeting moieties. Ultimately, these studies will provide critical knowledge to inform the design and optimal performance of ZI particles in an iterative fashion. In short, the proposed work will combine the synthetic and self-assembly expertise of the Herrera-Alonso lab with the expertise of the Bevan lab on TIRM measurements to understand how ZI NP chemistry and structure lead to different interactions with mucus and diffusive transport.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
