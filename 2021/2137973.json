 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).  In this project, funded by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and housed in the Chemistry Division, Professor Joseph Teprovich and his students at California State University Northridge (CSUN) will perform studies that aim to improve our understanding of electrolyte combinations so that lithium-ion batteries that are more efficient and have longer lifetimes can be developed.  Prof. Teprovich will also incorporate a new course into the curriculum at CSUN in order to educate a diverse group of students about the Chemistry of Energy, and he will facilitate research experiences that are directly related to desirable career choices in STEM for underrepresented students.\r\n\r\nProfessor Teprovich will systematically investigate large boron-rich anions (LBRA) as alternatives for PF6- and other common anions in electrolyte systems, with the goal of understanding and achieving high cation translational mobility while simultaneously reducing anion translational mobility. Two approaches, nanoionic destabilization and anion trapping, will be used to minimize the translational mobility of the LBRA.  A plan for broadening participation is presented that is centered around the high underrepresented minority (URM) student populations at CSUN, which is both a Hispanic Serving Institution (HIS) and an Asian American, Native American, Pacific Islander-Serving Institution (AANAPISI).  A main feature of the broadening participation plan is development of a summer STEM program for local high school students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The research findings from this project highlighted the potential future importance LBRA salts as building blocks for new and safer battery chemistries that do not rely on supply chain sensitive materials.
