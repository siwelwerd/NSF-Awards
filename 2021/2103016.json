 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research team aims to reconstruct changes in variability of the El  Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the last deglacial period by measuring coral delta O-18 on previously collected samples from Vanuatu in the tropical southwestern Pacific Ocean.  Modern coral delta O-18records from Vanuatu and pseudoproxy experiments show a  high  degree  of  skill  in  capturing changes  in  ENSO variability, providing confidence that the resulting records can be used to reconstruct past ENSO variability.  The researchers will compare the reconstructions to climate model output of ENSO during previous glacial times when Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) was both vigorous and sluggish.  \r\n\r\nThe research team\u2019s current hypotheses, based on climate model output, is that ENSO was reduced during  glacial  times,  relative  to  modern,  and  that  ENSO  was  more  active  when AMOC  was shutdown, relative to contemporaneous glacial times when AMOC was active.  \r\n\r\nThe team will conduct hosing model experiments under glacial boundary conditions to test the sensitivity of ENSO and AMOC changes to background conditions.  The research will also investigate how non-stationarity of ENSO may affect the skills of Vanuatu corals by using an ensemble of climate models run under different climate boundary conditions.  \r\n\r\nThe project may help shed light on the sensitivity of ENSO to external forcing, a highly critical issue given that climate models used for future climate projections do not agree if ENSO will strengthen or weaken as the Earth warms.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts include a deeper understanding of ENSO variability, development of a new drilling system for field research, involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in the research including undergraduates at a primarily undergraduate teaching institution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
