 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports early career researchers in the field of geomorphology to attend the 2021 Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium (BGS). This project targets the professional development of early career scholars who are currently completing a graduate degree, or are in the early stages of their academic, professional career. The theme of the symposium is the contribution of humans to environmental disturbances that advances our understanding of the role of humans on geomorphic systems, and their role in protecting, improving, and managing environmental resources. This symposium is an ideal scientific venue for young scholars to engage with established experts, present their research, and to talk face-to-face with an international community of scientists. The merit of this funding is evident from previously NSF funded symposiums reflected in scientific publications and collaborations. The broader impact of this support for students and early career scholars is research innovation and collaboration that promotes future global leaders, and to broaden participation of underrepresented scientists in STEM research.\r\n\r\nParticipation in the BGS will lead to the development of cutting-edge research and will enable U.S. scholars to take the lead in these endeavors. These young scholars develop new research agendas that investigate key scientific and societal challenges, promote collaboration with the international community, and disseminate advances in human-environment research through workshops, seminars, and peer-reviewed publications. These accomplishments result in the development of more innovative and productive research on human influences on the Earth that serves the Nation\u2019s interests regarding human impact on environments. The event will provide new insights and approaches to preserving environmental resources throughout the world, including the United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
