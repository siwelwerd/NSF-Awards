 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will focus on methods for analyzing data recorded in time and/or space that is count-valued, for example, daily county COVID-19 deaths, monthly state tornado counts, and annual North Atlantic severe hurricanes.  The data may be correlated in time, implying that counts observed today may be associated by counts occurring in the immediate past, or correlated in space, implying that adjacent observations are associated with each other.  The PI will develop statistical methods that take into account the particular type of distribution appropriate for the counts, for example, Poisson, geometric, and binomial, enabling the researcher to make more accurate forecasts and inferences. The models and methods developed here allow both positive and negative correlations in time and space, a feature not achievable with many current statistical count models.  For example, COVID-19 cases tend to cluster in groups, while oak and pine trees do not prefer to grow near one and other (negative correlation). The models to be developed in this project will permit the incorporation of covariates and allow for likelihood inference. The PI will also seek to construct the California Climate Center, a research station for climatic and environmental problems quantified by technical methods.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, the PI will transform a Gaussian space-time process into a count process having the desired marginal distribution(s).  The work will prove that this setup produces the most flexible count structures achievable. Extensions involving non-Gaussian processes will be explored and methods to fit the spatio-temporal model via maximum likelihood techniques will be developed via particle filtering and sequential Monte Carlo methods.  Extensions to multivariate count time series and will be examined and asymptotic inference for some setups will be studied.  Space-time applications to snow presence/absence trends in the Northern Hemisphere will be conducted.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
