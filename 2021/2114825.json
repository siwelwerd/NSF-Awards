The PI will focus his theoretical research on materials driven out-of-equilibrium from illumination by lasers of different light frequencies and polarization. The high purity light of a laser, which is very nearly of a single frequency in contrast to light from the sun or a light bulb, allows one to selectively deposit energy into the different (e.g. lattice, electronic, magnetic) degrees of freedom of a solid material. Because these different degrees of freedom interact with one another, energy deposited in one will ultimately be distributed among the others after some time, but at intermediate times interesting non-equilibrium phenomena can result. The goal of this project is to uncover interesting electrical and magnetic possibilities theoretically, and help guide experimental groups in their realization in the laboratory. Ultimately, this research may enable new quantum technologies based on light control of matter, including sensing, computing, and communication applications.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this project will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students through direct involvement with the PI in the research described. The PI will continue to deliver a wide range of public lectures with a focus on pre-college students from historically underrepresented backgrounds who have had limited exposure to theoretical physics and/or quantum sciences. Some of these lectures will be delivered through Northeastern University\u2019s Center for STEM Education. The PI will participate in the Building Bridges Program at Northeastern, an interactive day to introduce prospective college students to the sciences and engineering, and the Young Scholars program at Northeastern, a 6-week intensive summer program where rising high-school seniors work on cutting edge research problems and receive mentoring from faculty and university students.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports research and educational activities with an aim to understand and predict novel regimes of matter in quantum materials out-of-equilibrium. The PI will theoretically study the influence of laser-induced lattice changes on the electronic states of correlated electronic materials with strong spin-orbit coupling. The project will substantially extend equilibrium studies of systems with both strong spin-orbit coupling and electronic correlations to the non-equilibrium regime. By directly targeting selected phonon modes in a material with light, heating effects can be minimized, and coherent electronic and magnetic responses generated. Topological transitions, including higher order topological states, in the electronic and magnon band structures and redistribution of Berry curvature in the Brillouin zone will be a focus, as well as phase transitions/phase stabilization of unusual charge-ordered, magnetically-ordered, and superconducting states. Of particular interest will be nonlinear effects that may be induced in the materials through intense light. Nonlinear phononic studies and effects beyond the linear response regime (such as higher harmonic generation) will be studied as a means to drive and detect novel physical regimes and excitations created by intense, low-frequency light. The PI will use complementary theoretical methods that start from both the strong coupling limit and the weak coupling regime to explore the link between laser-induced lattice changes and electronic/magnetic property changes. Numerical and analytical approaches, including model Hamiltonian and first-principles studies, along with symmetry arguments will be employed.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this project will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students through direct involvement with the PI in the research described.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nMaterials where the quantum physics of electrons play an important role in the electronic, magnetic and optical properties are of broad importance because of their potential technological applications. In this work, the PI and his research team theoretically studied the interplay between electrons and the vibrations (which can be excited by a laser) of a crystalline lattice in several different materials and models of different classes of materials. The PI and his team worked in collaboration with experimental groups as part of this project and helped to explain their observations.\n\n\nThe Intellectual Merit of the project is that we now understand better how to exploit the vibrational modes of a crystalline lattice to produce target electronic and magnetic properties of a material. For example, in the case of MnBi2Te4 a laser can be tuned in energy to match a vibrational mode that changes the average atomic layer spacing in the material to turn an antiferromagnetic into a ferromagnet with a switching speed nearly as fast as the laser itself. The switching is entirely reversible and can be repeated indefinitely. Thus, this material may now function in dual roles: one as an antiferromagnet and another as a ferromagnet. Correspondingly, the PI also showed the nature of the electrical current flow is modified in the ferromagnetic state compared to the antiferromagnetic state (becoming topological in the ferromagnetic state). This result may also have applications in future electronic and opto-electronic devices. In addition, there were a number of important discoveries in the non-linear optical responses of important material classes, including using the optical response as a diagnostic tool for topological properties of electronic band structures. Metallic, insulating, and superconducting systems were all investigated over the course of the project.\n\n\nThe Broader Impact of the project lies not only in its potential reach into technology applications, but also in the wide dissemination of the results of the study. All research results are publicly available on open-access websites (arxiv.org), peer reviewed publications, and the NSF publication repository. The PI presented the results of his research in more than 30 technical talks given around the world over the course of this project, and 5 PhD (2 undergraduate) students participated directly in the research. The students also all presented their work at major international conferences, including the largest in the fieldthe annual March Meeting of the American Physical Society (APS). Students also attending specialized schools in the field, wrote manuscripts, received training for delivering scientific presentations, and received career counseling about the wide range of potential job opportunities available with a PhD in theoretical condensed matter physics. The PI also participated in broader outreach to the public at both the high school and undergraduate level to help increase awareness of the research enterprise and the recent advances in his specific field.
