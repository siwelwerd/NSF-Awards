 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns government and non-state actors' capacity to respond to simultaneous crises involving major disasters. In response to major disaster, the disaster state often delegates authority and encourages non-state service provision. Often, response capacity depends on service provision by self-directed groups and businesses that are not electorally accountable. Little is known about how the reliance of governments on non-state actors shapes the ability of the disaster state to respond to compounding crises. Using the state of Texas response to both COVID 19 and Winter Storm Uri as the compounding crises of interests, the PIs consider 1) the role of non-state actors in supplementing state capacity; 2) the implications of reliance on non-state actors for resource allocation and service provision across differing communities; and 3) the implications of this reliance for democratic accountability. Methodologically, the PIs use a longitudinal three wave survey of local health agencies, emergency management departments, and non-profits operating in Texas. The PIs focus on the moments of crisis to allow for test of hypotheses about the role of non-state actors and democratic accountability. The gathering of baseline data in relatively close proximity to the dual events is an essential component of this project. \r\n\r\nThis research will provide a baseline for the study of the disaster state. The PIs use a theoretical framework of state capacity to examine the disaster state and to integrate scholarship on American governance with literature on non-state service provision in the field of comparative politics. The PIs contribute to literature on state strength, distribution of non-state services and democratic accountability. The PIs conduct three state-wide survey waves in Texas in the aftermath of COVID 19 and Winter Storm Uri. In addition, the PIs conduct semi-structured interviews with representatives of government agencies and with representatives of non-state actors. Surveys will be implemented using the Qualtrics platform. Respondents for the initial survey will be recruited from Texas\u2019s 161 local health departments, public health districts, and local health units. With this survey data, the PIs test three research hypotheses related to state capacity, public/private interaction, and compounding crises. The PIs will generate basic scientific advances that may be applied by scholars seeking to understand and prepare for future multiple hazard situations. This research includes graduate student training and findings from the study will be shared with public officials and practitioners through a research and practice integration workshop.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
