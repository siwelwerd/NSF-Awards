 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosmic rays are charged particles that have been accelerated to high energies throughout the universe. This project aims to explain a feature in the spectrum of observed cosmic ray energies through a mechanism driven by passing stars or supernova remnants in a nearby region of the Milky Way. The team will perform computer simulations to test if this explanation can reproduce the observed feature and predict other observable features. The team will also incorporate their research into the UCSD STARS (Summer Training Academy for Research Success) program. This award advances the goals of the Windows on the Universe Big Idea. \r\n\r\nThe project will use a combination of analytical and numerical simulations of the re-acceleration of cosmic rays by weak shocks in the Local Bubble. These simulations will model the injection, transport, angular structure, and chemical composition of cosmic rays that have been re-accelerated by the shocks and then transported to the earth through magnetic flux tubes. The results will be compared with observations to determine whether this scenario can successfully explain the properties of the bump in the cosmic ray spectrum at intermediate energies. The work will be incorporated into a summer program at UCSD STARS and will also support the mentorship of a student from an underserved community in the San Diego area.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

They can exceed 1020 eV, equivalent to a high-speed baseball. While their origins are only partially understood, studying their journey through space provides valuable insight into the Sun&rsquo;s surroundings. The chemical composition of CRs is not specified across their entire spectrum. However, 90% are protons, 9% are alpha particles, and the rest are heavier nuclei, electrons, and antiparticles.</div>\r\n<div id=\"magicparlabel-1896\" class=\"standard\">The primary goal of this project was to understand the nature of various anomalies in the CR spectra, cutting across energy spectra and angular distribution, including chemical composition. These were unveiled only recently after the observation technique improved dramatically. Our particular interest was centered around the so-called CR bump in the mid-energy range of the CR spectrum. We have shown that it should have been formed not far away because otherwise, no sharp features in the above spectral characteristcs were possible due to the scrambling of the particle orbits in their arrival directions in a turbulent magnetic field of the interstellar medium. The sharpness of the spectral breaks associated with the bump, the abrupt change of the CR intensity across the local magnetic equator (90 degree pitch angle), and the similarity between the primary and secondary CR spectral patterns point to a local reacceleration of the bump particles out of the background CRs. We argue that, owing to a steep preexisting CR spectrum, a nearby shock may generate such a bump by boosting particle rigidity by a mere factor of 1.5 in the range below 50 TV. Reaccelerated particles below 0.5 TV are convected with the interstellar medium &#64258;ow and do not reach the Sun. The particles above this rigidity then form the bump. This single universal process is responsible for the observed spectral features of all CR nuclei, primary and secondary, in the rigidity range below 100 TV. We propose that one viable candidate is the system of shocks associated with Eridani star at 3.2 pc of the Sun, which is well aligned with the direction of the local magnetic &#64257;eld. Other shocks, such as old supernova shells,may produce a similar e&#64256;ect. We provide a simple formula that reproduces the spectra of all CR species with only three parameters uniquely derived from the CR proton data. We show how our formalism predicts helium, boron, carbon, oxygen, and iron spectra, for which accurate data in GV-TV range exist. Our model thus uni&#64257;es all the CR spectral features observed below 50 TV.</div>\r\n<div id=\"magicparlabel-1897\" class=\"standard\">Our results offer a broader look at the local ISM environment reaching far beyond the CR research but may awake a significant interest of general public to the local interstellar medium (the so-called local bubble) by demonstrating the role of passing stars and their magnetic connectivity to the heliosphere.</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/28/2024<br>\nModified by: Mikhail&nbsp;A&nbsp;Malkov</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109103/2109103_10760609_1732822902196_CR_spectra--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109103/2109103_10760609_1732822902196_CR_spectra--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Fig.3.
