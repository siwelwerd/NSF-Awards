 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently deployed fifth generation (5G) solutions operate in frequency bands, mostly below 6 GHz, and to a limited extent at 28/39 GHz, and expansion to other emerging frequency bands is under consideration.  When operating at 28 GHz or 39 GHz, hundreds of antennas are needed to boost the power of the transmitted signal to form a focused beam to increase the communication range.  On the receiver, there is a unique opportunity to take advantage of the many antenna elements to also cancel out or attenuate interference from unwanted directions.   This proposal seeks to understand the most power efficient and optimal means of achieving interference cancellation.  Furthermore, as the transition of high-speed applications starts to occur from sub-6 GHz frequency bands to higher frequencies, especially at 28/39 GHz, traditional means of cancelling unwanted interference operating in other frequency bands (other \u201cchannels\u201d) using high quality acoustic resonators does not seem viable.  As such, this project will explore the application of filters that are electronically tunable and take advantage of the switching properties of modern digital devices as a means of overcoming these limitations.  While addressing the coexistence issue is a major hurdle for commercial radios, many other radios are also in danger of losing functionality and sensitivity if steps are not taken to address the problem of interference. Many important sensors, such as weather radars and radio astronomy telescopes, may cease to function if interference levels increase as expected. It is therefore imperative to protect such radios by directly collaborating with the radio astronomy community.  This research will also lead to the training of students in the engineering of modern communications systems and wireless communications. \r\nFuture generation of radios utilize broader band millimeter-wave (mm-wave) front-ends, higher channel bandwidths (1 GHz or more), and beamforming.  Multi antenna array signal processing techniques naturally provide some spatial filtering of unwanted signals.  By placing nulls in the antenna pattern to purposefully \u201czero-out\u201d interference, one can improve signal-to-distortion ratio, achieve better spectrum utilization, and realize more robust radios. While all these benefits can be realized using digital signal processing, the wide dynamic range requirements on the analog-to-digital converter make the hundred element array radio high power and even unfeasible.  Furthermore, out-of-band interference will likely pose an issue when the mm-wave spectrum is more crowded. Traditional ways of removing interference using sharp filters based on high-Q resonators is not viable above 10 GHz.  To address these issues, interference cancellation will be explored in several locations in the receiver, at the radio frequency itself (using tunable electronic notch filters), at the boundary between radio frequency blocks and analog blocks (spatial notch), as well as inside the analog-to-digital converter itself. In this way, interference will be rejected before (or during) quantization, which will reduce the dynamic range requirements of the receiver greatly. This is especially important at wider channel bandwidths proposed in 5G and future generation radios.  Cancellation of interference, though, requires knowledge of the location and frequency of the interfering signal.  Digital and baseband tracking loops will be explored to identify the properties of the interfering signal and feedback loops will then allow interference cancellation to be performed in the various forms.  Application of these techniques for the protection of passive radio sensors, such as radio astronomy telescopes, will be studied and techniques for interference tracking from the radio astronomy community will be investigated.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe goal of our research was to explore wireless communication in an interference dominated environment. This is certainly the case in today's modern wireless connectivity world where at a given time in a given location hundreds of devicesaccess the Internet through the wireless spectrum. As such we addressed interference both at the source, by exploring more efficient wireless transmitters that can also behave better by minimizing their impact outside of the intended band, making them loud in-band and quiet out-of-band, and by addressing how the interference can be rejected by the receiver through spatial selectivity. The same principle of spatial selectivity also applies to the transmitter. At the same time, we addressed how these interference rejection schemes can be applied to radio astronomy telescopes that operate in similar or nearby frequency bands as manmade wireless communication and radar equipment. These devices need to sense a needle in a haystack because the signals originate from other galaxies or the early universe.\r\n\n\nWe have made great progress in improving the state-of-the-art for both more efficient transmitters and for understanding and implementation of spatial selectivity at the receiver. On the transmitter side we demonstrated two silicon CMOS prototypes that operate in mm-wave bands for 5G (5th generation) and for proposed radar / communications bands that will be used for 6G. The techniques allow the transmitters to be designed more optimally to be more energy efficient while minimizing the impact of non-linearity and distortion that can spill into nearby bands. The performance demonstrated at 90 GHz for a 6G radio is among the best reported in the literature. Two papers have been published in the literature (one awaiting publication).\r\n\n\nOn the receiver side, we built a software emulation framework that allows one to understand the trade-offs in the design of a communication system with multiple users and interference. The system employs multiple antennas and beamforming to select between different users including impairments such as quantization noise that limit the accuracy of the cancellation. Since higher resolution quantization is very power hungry, its important to see how much we can reduce the resolution and still make the system work. The overall system is non-linear and requires extensive simulation to understand limiting cases. Our open-source framework is based on a popular tool (matlab) and its released to the public through github with a user friendly GUI. An accompanying publication on arXiv.org describes the inner workings of the simulator.\r\n\n\nFinally, we investigated the optimal ways to build efficient beamforming systems. Typically, this is done with explicit RF, analog or digital phase shifters. These extra components require extra power consumption, area, and calibration. Our research demonstrated that the phase shifting can be done in the mixed-signal analog domain inside the quantizer, essentially doing two tasks without the additional burden, beamforming and conversion of an analog signal to a digital one. By utilizing the inner workings of a popular analog-to-digital converter, which is widely used, by sharing the charge in-between channels in the correct manner, we can impart phase and gain information, essentially doing spatial filtering in the process. The results were demonstrated with a hardware CMOS prototype to be presented in a conference paper and discussed in detail in a dissertation report.\r\n\n\nBy working with our colleagues in the radio astronomy community, we were able to co-educate each other on techniques that may find applications in our own domains. Radio telescopes in many ways mimic modern mm-wave communication systems, employing many antennas and performing signal-processing to extract the desired signals. Our team was able to demonstrate synchronization of such radios which enables digital techniques to be applied across a wide array.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AliMNiknejad\n"
