 "awd_abstract_narration": "Managing a secure software environment is essential to a trustworthy cyberinfrastructure.\r\nSoftware supply chain attacks may be a top concern for IT departments, but they are also an\r\naspect of scientific computing. The threat to scientific reputation caused by problematic software\r\ncan be just as dangerous as an environment contaminated with malware. The issue of\r\nmanaging environments affects any individual researcher performing computational research\r\nbut is more acute for multi-institution scientific collaborations as they often preside over complex\r\nsoftware stacks and must manage software environments across many distributed computing\r\nresources. Increasingly, these collaborations and individual investigators have turned to Linux\r\ncontainer images (packing application software, operating system and other needed libraries\r\ninto one entity) for their platform portability and scientific reproducibility advantages. However, in\r\ndoing so new software sources from both public and private repositories are introduced into the\r\nsupply chain, thus bringing new risks. The Securing an Open and Trustworthy Ecosystem for\r\nResearch Infrastructure and Applications (SOTERIA) project is an element within NSF's fabric of\r\ncoordinated Cyberinfrastructure that helps collaborations avoid security pitfalls while reducing\r\nthe burden of scientific software management. SOTERIA aims to provide researchers with\r\nimproved discoverability, visibility, and traceability of their software environments.\r\n\r\nSOTERIA operates a container registry for open science. The registry has been customized to\r\nmeet the unique needs of the scientific environment, including associating the researcher\u2019s\r\nidentity with container images, providing image security scanning and introspection (visibility),\r\nand integration with other digital object identification and archiving services. SOTERIA also\r\noperates a container distribution service with tools to trace image provenance through the\r\necosystem. Finally, as the challenge of managing secure software environments goes far\r\nbeyond container security, SOTERIA provides training and education on best practices tailored\r\nto researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
