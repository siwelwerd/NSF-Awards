 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bowhead whales migrate through the Bering Strait every spring to feed on zooplankton growing in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas; they are vital to the marine ecosystem and to Alaska Native communities. As the Arctic warms, some whales may be changing their migration patterns to spend winter on their summer feeding grounds. Changes to migration could impact breeding and increase competition, killer whale attacks, and ship-strike risk. Bowhead whale vocalizations provide an opportunity to use passive acoustic monitoring to study their movement. This project combines data on bowhead whale calls with environmental and prey data to track movement and predict ship-strike risk. The findings will improve management of this ecologically, biologically, and culturally important species and help researchers understand climate change impacts on whale behavior. Research results will be presented in Alaska and to Arctic researchers. Activities planned for undergraduate, public, and K-12 audiences will provide opportunities to engage participants in marine mammal science and bioacoustics.\r\n\r\nThis research addresses the impacts of climate change on bowhead migration, the drivers of migration, and the potential for ship strikes in Bering Strait and the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Long-term passive acoustic data from three mooring locations combined with modeled environmental and prey data are used to examine the drivers of bowhead migration. This research will quantify whale presence during seasonal periods when whales are historically not expected to be present in the area. Results will indicate whether bowhead whales are changing their migratory patterns, which could impact Indigenous communities. Whale presence will be analyzed relative to vessel traffic, which will provide insight on ship-strike risk and effects of ship noise on bowheads.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The remoteness and extreme conditions of the Pacific Arctic limits the methods available for studying these animals; however, bowheads are consistently vocal, which provides an opportunity to use passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). By leveraging PAM data collected from 2008 to 2022, this research explored bowhead migration timing and patterns and their relationship with sea ice. We found that migration timing was strongly linked to the timing of sea ice growth and melt. Further, some whales are remaining in the southern Chukchi Sea for winter rather than the northwestern Bering Sea, and they are spending more time in summer in the western Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea.</p>\r\n<p>A northward shift in winter could put bowhead whales in the direct path of vessel traffic. Thus, one aspect of this research -- in collaboration with Alaska Department of Fish and Game and University of Alaska Fairbanks -- combined vessel location data (2013-2019) with bowhead distributions developed from satellite-linked telemetry data (2008-2019) to assess how changes in bowhead distribution before, during, and after a low sea ice event in 2017 affected overlap with vessels. Bowhead distribution contracted and shifted northward during the low sea ice event, resulting in less overlap between vessels and bowheads; however, the vessels that overlapped with bowhead habitat were larger and faster. Across all years, vessels were concentrated along the northern coast of Chukotka and western side of Bering Strait. Thus, while it appears that bowheads have some flexibility in adjusting to a rapidly changing Arctic, larger, faster vessels in smaller areas could put whales at greater risk of vessel strikes, especially in the western Pacific Arctic.</p>\r\n<p>These findings improved our understanding of bowhead whale ecology, and add to the growing body of literature providing evidence of on-going extreme and fundamental change to the structure and function of the Pacific Arctic. The research is relevant to marine mammal science, bioacoustics, and Arctic science disciplines. Additionally, these results highlight how PAM can be used to study whale movement, a model that can be used in other regions and with other vocal species. Products from this and related research include three open-access peer-reviewed journal publications; one co-authored white paper for the International Whaling Commission; one co-authored book chapter on using passive acoustic monitoring to monitor marine mammals; an infographic developed as a scient communication tool; and an editorial in WWF Global Arctic's The Circle Magazine.
