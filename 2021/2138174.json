 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum information technology leverages the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics for information processing, which is expected to significantly advance the capability of computing, sensing, and communication security. The essential underlying backbone is quantum interconnect that can transfer quantum information faithfully between disparate systems. A variety of approaches have been explored for this purpose. So far, their performances are limited and significant challenges remain before they could be implemented in a practical quantum interconnect that requires transferring fragile quantum states faithfully at a high speed, in a scalable fashion, and across a broad spectral range. The project aims to address this challenge, by exploring and developing a multifunctional integrated quantum processing unit for photons that can significantly enhance the quantum connectivity for a future quantum interconnect. This research is expected to offer a new paradigm for processing quantum information carried by photons, opening up a novel path towards the quantum advantage. The technology developed under this program is expected to have profound commercial impact on the industrial sector. The project will contribute to the workforce development for future quantum industry. The associated educational efforts and outreach activities are expected to offer extraordinary materials and inspiration and excellent opportunities for training students from K-12 to graduate students and for broadening the participation from underrepresented and economically disadvantageous groups.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to explore and develop a multifunctional quantum photonic processor on a newly developed scalable and integrated lithium niobate platform, to produce, store, manipulate, and transduce photonic quantum states and scalable quantum bits in a deterministic fashion that is expected to significantly enhance the quantum connectivity for next-generation quantum interconnect. The project leverages our leading expertise in integrated photonics, quantum and nonlinear optics, quantum material science and engineering, and quantum measurement and characterization, to carry out a synergetic fundamental research directed towards realizing efficient photon-photon and photon- ion interactions that would enable a series of quantum logic, transduction, storage, and processing functionalities expected to transform the state-of-the-art of quantum connectivity. The direct telecom compatibility and the platform scalability of the underlying photonic integrated circuit platform enable seamless transition to practical implementation and application in the near future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
