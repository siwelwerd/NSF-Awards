 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum computers are expected to revolutionize the future of science and technology by solving complex problems that are beyond the reach of current classical supercomputers. So far, several physical platforms have been demonstrated as prototypes for implementation of universal quantum processors. Each physical implementation holds specific benefits in demonstrating coherent manipulation of quantum state while suffering downfalls that prevent their scalable integration. Many quantum computing tasks would benefit enormously from the ability to coherently connect those physically distinct information processing platforms. One such application is quantum random access memory (QRAM), a key component in many well-known quantum algorithms that allows stored data to be extracted in quantum superposition. This research develops a hybrid QRAM device composed of superconducting qubits and high-quality acoustic cavities joined together by highly tunable interconnects. The team will draw on their expertise in materials science, nanofabrication, quantum device physics, and quantum information theory to construct and optimize this device. This project entails integrated research, education, and outreach efforts that encourage full participation of underrepresented groups in quantum science and technology, including summer camps for K-12 students and teachers, course and outreach material development, undergraduate and graduate research and advising, and postdoc mentoring.\r\n\r\nAlthough QRAM is central to many important applications such as Grover\u2019s search algorithm and solving linear systems of equations on a quantum computer, its experimental implementation has remained elusive. This is due to challenges in building a system that offers both a high-quality multi-mode quantum memory and a high degree of controllability. This project addresses this long-standing challenge by combining one of the frontrunners for quantum computing---superconducting Transmon qubits---with state-of-the-art acoustic resonator memories, which offer highly compact, long-lived quantum information storage. A coherent switchable interconnect needed for QRAM or transduction operation is provided by a voltage-tunable resonator that integrates a hybrid superconductor\u2013semiconductor Josephson junction for on demand tuning of resonance frequency. This effort will not only lead to the first demonstration of QRAM in the laboratory but will also significantly advance the field of quantum transduction, where acoustic cavity modes are widely recognized as one of the most promising ways to connect distinct physical platforms due to their versatility and compatibility with a range of quantum systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
