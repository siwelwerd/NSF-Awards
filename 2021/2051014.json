 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). \r\n\r\nThis doctoral dissertation project reconstructs evolutionary relationships among ancient populations of Homo erectus, a pivotal human ancestor, using dental and skeletal data. The project integrates paleontological and population genetics approaches for reconstructing evolutionary history, thereby advancing knowledge about how hominins, including our species, Homo sapiens, evolved. The project promotes interdisciplinarity by using approaches typically used in the field of bioarchaeology, increases diversity in the field of paleoanthropology by supporting the scholarship of a female paleoanthropologist, and fosters international research collaborations. The investigator conducts public and K-12 science outreach through a weblog about human evolution and through science activities with middle and high school students.\r\n\r\nHomo erectus, represented in the hominin fossil record, is morphologically diverse through both time and space. The current understanding of how populations of H. erectus were related to each other is limited. Bony and dental anatomy provide the primary basis for assessing evolutionary relationships between populations in the fossil record, but the genetic basis of anatomical traits is not always well understood. This research examines H. erectus temporal and geographic patterns in the relationships among past H. erectus populations using biodistance methods and comparative data. Matrices of dental and neurocranial shape distances will be compared separately using Mantel tests to a matrix describing the temporal, geographic, or genetic distances between populations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nHomo erectus was the longest-lived hominin species, the first hominin to leave Africa, and a direct ancestor of the hominins that eventually gave rise to our own species. Yet, it is poorly understod how populations of H. erectus were related to each other across time and space. This study calculated shape differences between different populations of H. erectus as a proxy for genetic differences. It was found that the anatomy of the temporal bone was most likely to recover information about population history in this species, and that Indonesian populations of H. erectus were anatomically distinct from populations in mainland Eurasia and Africa. A subsequent analysis of evolutionary relationships found that those Indonesian populations occupied the basal branches of the H. erectus \"family tree.\" These findings seemingly contradict the conventional understanding of H. erectus population history in which early African and early mainland Eurasian populations are considered ancestral to all subsequent H. erectus groups. Our results are compatible with (but do not necessarily prove) two scenarios, both of which would transform our understanding of the dispersal of hominins out of Africa. In one scenario, the first hominin to leave Africa is not H. erectus but rather is a more primirive species of Homo. Homo erectus then ultimately evolves in Asia from this dispersing species. Alternatively, Homo erectus evolves in Africa and disperses into Asia, but the dispersing population resembles Indonesian populations and is currently unknown in Africa and mainland Eurasia. The timing of this dispersal must have predated the earliest H. erectus fossils currently known from Asia.\r\n\n\nThis project has also promoted the public understanding of science by initiating two science outreach efforts.
