 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a lithium metal battery (LMB) technology that is superior to state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).  Technical bottlenecks in current LIBs are one limitation on the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. In this context, higher energy density batteries are needed to improve the driving range of electric vehicles.  At the same time these improved batteries must also have an affordable cost, long lifetime, and reliable safety. The proposed LMB technology in this I-Corps project can potentially meet all these requirements.  Successful development of this new LMB technology has the potential to boost the market share of electric vehicles and help the adoption of renewable energy sources.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project develops a high-energy lithium metal battery LMB technology, which consists of a lithium (Li) metal anode and a layered LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathode.  The Li anode enables an extremely high capacity, 10 times higher than that of the graphite anode in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The NMC811 cathode is more cost-effective while enabling a higher capacity than that of the currently utilized LiCoO2 in LIBs. This project utilizes two nanocoatings conformally deposited using atomic layer deposition on the Li anode and NMC811 cathode.  These coatings can significantly improve the lifetime and sustained high capacity of the Li anode and NMC811 cathode.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
