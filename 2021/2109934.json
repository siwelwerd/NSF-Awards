 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Summary: \r\n \r\nIn this project funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in Division of Materials Research, Professor Amanda Morris of the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University is exploring the electronic properties of metal organic frameworks. The goal of the project is to learn how to control these properties and aid in the development of next generation smart windows, batteries, sensors, and catalysts. The project addresses critical, present-day environmental and energy technology challenges and thus, holds the potential for truly transformative environmental and economic benefits. The proposed work serves as the inspiration for outreach demonstrations to be conducted at a local children's museum for K-5 students and educational enrichment opportunities at Virginia Tech. The principal investigator has a demonstrated commitment to the recruitment and mentoring of diverse undergraduate and graduate students through activities with the Women\u2019s Mentorship Network, oSTEM, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Inclusive Pedagogy Program. \r\n \r\n \r\nTechnical Summary: \r\n \r\nMetal organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a promising platform for electrocatalysis, electrochemical energy storage, and electrochemical sensing. Fundamental to these applications is the process of charge transport, i.e., the motion of electrons through molecular orbitals coupled to the motion of counter-balancing ions. The Morris group aims to establish MOF structure-function relationships and identify key design parameters for electroactive MOF synthesis along the following specific objectives: (1) Measure the rate of charge transport as a function of carrier identity (electron or hole). (2) Uncover the properties and/or processes that limit electrochemical redox-hopping ion transport in MOFs, including structured solvent and ion pairing investigations. (3) Elucidate the role of defects (in-MOF and grain boundaries) in dictating the rate of redoxhopping charge transport. Finally, in an iterative feedback loop outcomes of these fundamental studies and their application to electrochromics and biomass catalysis will be connected.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
