 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Yi Xiao and her research team in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Florida International University (FIU) seek to develop a widely usable method for the rapid generation of DNA-based bioreceptors, termed aptamers, which selectively recognize small molecules targets. Aptamers have shown promise as key sensing components for point-of-use, small-molecule biosensing detectors that recognize target molecules by aptamer binding to the targets, making them potentially valuable for scientific, clinical, and forensic applications. However, current methods for aptamer generation are labor intensive, time consuming, and typically yield aptamers that are unable to clearly tell the difference between molecules of similar shape and size. The proposed approach produces high-quality aptamers with superior recognition properties and significantly accelerates the aptamer isolation process. Moreover, this technique might replace existing methods for aptamer generation. In parallel with these research efforts, Professor Xiao, in partnership with Hispanic-serving and historically black colleges and universities, as well as student training programs at FIU, plans a multi-level outreach effort focusing on underrepresented minority (URM) students. These activities will provide students with opportunities to participate in scientific research and encourage them to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. In pursuit of this, Dr. Xiao gives science seminars and presentations, organizes summer science camps, and provides summer internships. \r\n\r\nLeveraging the high structural specificity and efficiency of flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), Professor Xiao and her research team seek to develop an innovative and generalizable nuclease-assisted aptamer isolation technique, termed NA-SELEX, for the rapid isolation of high-affinity, small-molecule-binding aptamers. To establish this technology, a model SELEX system is first used to systematically study and optimize FEN1-based strand separation. The feasibility and generalizability of NA-SELEX is then demonstrated by isolating high-affinity aptamers for different small-molecule targets with clinical and forensic relevance. Finally, the sensing capabilities of the resulting aptamers is assessed by fabricating electrochemical aptamer-based sensors for analyte detection in biological samples. This new approach has the potential to efficiently generate high-affinity, customizable aptamers on demand for any small-molecule target and greatly facilitate the development of sensing elements for the detection of small molecules for various applications such as food safety, environmental monitoring, therapeutic treatment, and medical diagnostics. In addition, an educational outreach program at FIU increases the exposure of graduate, undergraduate, and high school URM students to STEM fields and promotes an inclusive environment for URMs engaged in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

During this project, we published 12 papers, two US patents and one patent provision. Some of these works are highlighted below:</p>\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Isolation of high-affinity aptamers for in vitro and in vivo cocaine sensing.</strong></p>\n<p>We utilized a high-stringency, library-immobilized SELEX workflow incorporating a rigorous counter-SELEX component to isolate high-affinity DNA aptamers specific against cocaine. Using these novel aptamers, we then developed two sensors for cocaine detection. The first, an <em>in vitro</em> fluorescent sensor, detects cocaine at clinically relevant levels in 50% human serum without responding significantly to other drugs of abuse, endogenous substances, or diverse range of therapeutic agents. The second, an electrochemical aptamer-based sensor (<strong>Figure 1A</strong>), supports the real-time, seconds-resolved measurement of cocaine concentrations <em>in vivo</em> in the circulation of live animals (<strong>Figure 1B</strong>). We believe the aptamers and sensors developed here could prove valuable for both point-of-care and on-site clinical cocaine detection as well as fundamental studies of cocaine neuropharmacology.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Nuclease-assisted selection of slow-off rate aptamers.</strong><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Conventional directed evolution methods offer the ability to select bioreceptors with high binding affinity for a specific target in terms of thermodynamic properties. However, there is a lack of analogous approaches for kinetic selection, which could yield affinity reagents that exhibit slow off-rates and thus remain tightly bound to targets for extended periods. We developed an <em>in vitro</em> SELEX methodology that employs the nuclease flap endonuclease 1 to achieve the efficient discovery of aptamers that have slow dissociation rates (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). Our nuclease-assisted selection strategy yields high-affinity aptamers for both small molecules and proteins with off-rates that are an order of magnitude slower relative to those obtained with conventional selection methods. This new methodology provides a generalizable approach for generating slow off-rate aptamers for diverse targets, which could in turn prove valuable for applications including molecular devices, bioimaging, and therapy.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Determining the binding profile of aptamers using T5 exonuclease.</strong> We described a novel method for accurately and sensitively evaluating the binding between DNA aptamers and small-molecule ligands in a high-throughput format. This approach is based on our new finding that ligand binding inhibits aptamer digestion by T5 exonuclease, where the extent of this inhibition correlates closely with the strength of aptamer-ligand binding (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). Our assay enables accurate and efficient screening of the ligand-binding profiles of individual aptamers, as well as the identification of the best target binders, independent of the ligands in question or the aptamer sequence and structure. We expect that our assay can be readily expanded to characterize small-molecule-binding aptamers in an automated, high-throughput fashion.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Exonuclease-directed aptamer engineering based on exonuclease III and exonuclease I.</strong></p>\n<p>We developed a generalizable method that utilizes exonuclease III and exonuclease I to interrogate the binding properties of small-molecule-binding aptamers regardless of sequence, structure, and length in a rapid, label-free assay (<strong>Figure 4A</strong>). We utilized this assay to enhance the binding characteristics of a DNA aptamer which binds indiscriminately to ATP and its analogues. We screened 13 mutants derived from this aptamer and identified two new high-affinity aptamers that solely bind to adenosine (<strong>Figure 4B</strong>). We incorporate these two aptamers directly into an E-AB sensor, which achieved a detection limit of 1 &micro;M adenosine in 50% serum.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Aptamer-dye complexes for label-free colorimetric small molecule sensing. </strong></p>\n<p>We developed a generalizable strategy for the utilization of aptamers in cyanine dye-displacement assays regardless of aptamer sequence, length, structure, target affinity, or the physicochemical properties of the target analyte (<strong>Figure 5A</strong>). With Cy7, we found that the most crucial determinant of a successful assay is the ratio of the concentration of aptamer and dye and demonstrate that assays optimized based on this ratio deliver sensitive detection performance (<strong>Figure 5B</strong>). As a further demonstration of the generality of this strategy, we successfully employed another cyanine dye, MTC, in dye-displacement assays with nine different DNA aptamers of diverse sequence and structure for the sensitive and specific detection of small molecules, even in biological samples such as saliva. Our findings should streamline development and broaden the application of label-free and sensitive aptamer-based colorimetric assays for the detection of diverse small molecules.</p>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Development of a new process to fabricate paper-based electrochemical aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors.</strong></p>\n<p>E-AB sensors offer a powerful and general means for analyte detection in complex samples for various applications. To make the E-AB sensors proposed in this project amenable for on-site detection, we developed a new process to fabricate paper-based electrochemical sensors containing a three-electrode system via ambient vacuum filtration. The method allows customization over electrode material, shape, size, and thickness of the three-electrode. We developed aptamer-modified PEDs that enable sensitive and specific detection of detection of small molecules (<strong>Figure 6</strong>), even in biosamples with similar sensitivity as commercial gold electrodes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 08/15/2024<br>\nModified by: Yi&nbsp;Xiao</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2135005/2135005_10620340_1723760635796_NSF_Fig_1_0815--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2135005/2135005_10620340_1723760635796_NSF_Fig_1_0815--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2135005/2135005_10620340_1723760635796_NSF_Fig_1_0815--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">We have incorporated high-affinity cocaine aptamers discovered via SELEX into electrochemical aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors.
