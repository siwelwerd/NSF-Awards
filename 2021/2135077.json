 "awd_abstract_narration": "Automotive and aerial vehicles are being equipped with more sensors to enhance automated driving/flying as well as to perform general sensing tasks. Despite increasing data rates from cameras, LIDAR, and RADAR, along with higher levels of onboard computation, such vehicles do not have the means to share such high rate sensor data to enhance their situational awareness or improve cooperation. Millimeter-wave communication is one solution for high data rate vehicular communications. Achieving the highest rates with millimeter-wave, though, requires frequent link reconfiguration in mobile environments. This research is aimed at using the information derived from sensors that operate in some band other than the communication band, to help configure the communication link. The emphasis is placed on theoretical development and experimental validation of frameworks of using sensor information to permit link reconfiguration in mobile environments. Broader impacts include teaching, mentoring, participation of underrepresented groups, community outreach through demos and videos, and technology transfer through collaborations with industry partners. \r\n\r\nThis research project addresses the fundamentals of communication using side information derived from various sensing techniques. The project leverages mathematical tools from array signal processing and machine learning and will focus on the applications related to beam configuration. On the theoretical side, this project develops mathematical tools for understanding the frequency of beam realignment, a framework for relating radar and communication paths, and fundamental limits for sensor-aided beam alignment in millimeter-wave communication. On the practical side, this project tests critical hypothesis about statistical correlations between sensor measurements and communication link performance in a series of testbeds. The testbeds support low-cost radar derived from WiFi signals and higher cost automotive radars, coupled with custom developed millimeter-wave communication link capability. Outcomes of this research include (i) an understanding of how much overhead can be reduced by using information derived from potentially very different communication bands, and (ii) rapidly reconfigurable and robust millimeter-wave communication links.",
