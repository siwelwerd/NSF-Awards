 "awd_abstract_narration": "Existing methods for the manipulation and testing of miniature matter have numerous drawbacks, which limit their dexterity and inhibit broader adoption in science and engineering. They require large and complex equipment, have limited output forces, lack local sensing capability, and only have one or a few degrees of freedom for active motion. To address these issues, this project will explore micro-origami with multiple active degrees of freedom to create low-cost and customizable systems for versatile motion, sensing, and dexterous manipulation. These miniature manipulators can be readily adopted for various applications such as extraction and testing of organic cells, micro-system packaging, testing of friction between granular particles, and micro-robotic arms. The improved versatility and low-cost of these systems will make them widely accessible and allow for mass fabrication of numerous devices to statistically test many samples or for application within robotic swarms. Additionally, this award will support outreach and educational efforts, including introducing middle-school girls to engineering and micro-manipulators through a summer program; creating curricula on origami inspired manipulators for a graduate course; and establishing research and mentoring opportunities for underrepresented transfer students.\r\n\r\nThe project will establish an integrated methodology for the fabrication, analysis, design, sensing, and control of micro-origami systems with advanced dexterity for miniature manipulation and testing. Material systems will be identified, and fabrication processes will be established to create electro-thermally active origami at scales ranging from 10\u00b5m to 1mm. Testing of the systems will give insight to their mechanical performance, reliability, and responsiveness. Micro-origami with increasingly complex motions will be fabricated and investigated to give insight to practical challenges such as packaging, circuits, and dimensional limits of the manipulators. Simplified static and dynamic analytical models will be created to simulate the electro-thermo-mechanical coupling that occurs due to the large angle actuation of the micro-origami. The models will be validated with experimental tests and high-fidelity simulations and used to create an optimization framework that will guide the design of micro-origami for specific tasks in the manipulation of physical matter. Design and fabrication methods will be explored to embed piezoresistive- and optic-based displacement sensors within the micro-origami. On-chip and off-chip measurements will be synthesized to permit for real-time feedback control and estimation of the forces acting on the manipulators by their surroundings or payloads. Testing the micro-origami systems will give insight to the error and repeatability of open- and closed-loop control that would enable dexterous micro-manipulation and testing.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our micro-origami systems integrate the advantages of three transducer systems including: (i) a strained morph systems for 3D self-assembly; (ii) polymer based electro-thermal systems for large active folding; and (iii) thin-film PZT transducers for high frequency vibration and power efficient motion. A versatile photolithography-based process is introduced to micro-fabricate this mixed-transducer micro-origami system, and the performance of the three transducer systems is tested. We showed that mixed-transducer micro-origami can achieve complex actuation motions and sensing capabilities beyond systems that rely on a single transducer system.</p>\r\n<p>Our work also introduced a rapid multi-physics framework for the simulation of electro-thermally actuated origami systems. This framework can simultaneously capture: thermo-mechancially coupled actuation, inter panel contact, heat transfer, large deformation folding, and other complex loading applied onto the origami. Comparisons with finite element models validate the proposed framework for simulating origami heat transfer with different system geometries, materials, and surrounding environments. Verification of the simulated folding behaviors against physical electro-thermal micro-origami further demonstrates the validity of the proposed model. The framework provides a novel simulation tool for analysis, design, control, and optimization of active origami systems, pushing the boundary for feasible shape morphing and functional capability.</p>\r\n<p>We further established a simulation model that can capture the nonlinear coupling between thermal conduction and large deformations for an electrothermally-actuated micro-origami system with structure-dependent thermal resistances and capacitances. The model is compared to experimental results for both static and step responses. After calibration of material properties and introduction of additional residual stress that is related to the heating rate, the model can closely match the experimental step response behavior. This model may help to control the transient folding process of future micro-origami systems.</p>\r\n<p>Next, our project addressed the challenging problem for inverse design of origami-inspired systems by harnessing interpretable machine learning methods. We established a work-flow based on decision tree-random forest method to fit origami databases, containing both design features and functional performance, and to generate human-understandable decision rules for the inverse design of functional origami. This method is unique because it can compare different origami patterns for the same design, it can tackle multi-objective problems, and can extend existing shape-fitting algorithms for origami to consider non-geometrical performance. The proposed framework enables holistic inverse design of origami, considering both shape and function, to build novel reconfigurable structures for various applications.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, our project created and evaluated an estimation method for an unknown external force acting to the panel-hinge micro-origami structure based on model-predictive control techniques. Two estimation methods were proposed with one penalizing both output error and the estimated input and another one only penalizing on the input with additional state bounds. We showed that the estimation method with output error penalty can match the true trajectory well and shows some robustness when model parameters are mismatched. The estimation method without output error penalty displays strong resistance to noise disturbance on the true output. These methods are important for achieving force estimation and sensing with real origami micro-structures that interact with the physical environment.</p>\r\n<p>In summary, our project has explored the fabrication, analysis, design, and operation of micro-origami with multiple active degrees-of-freedom to create low-cost and customizable systems for versatile motions, sensing, and dexterous manipulation. These miniature manipulators can be readily adopted for various applications such as extraction and testing of organic cells, micro-system packaging, testing of friction between granular particles, micro-robotic arms, and others.
