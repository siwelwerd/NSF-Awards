 "awd_abstract_narration": "Methods to stabilize enzymes to improve their performance in industrial processes have been pursued for decades. A promising approach combines enzymes with synthetic polymers. Attaching enzymes to synthetic materials has been shown to enhance their recyclability. This approach has also been shown to decrease enzyme denaturation in extreme environments. However, little is understood about why certain materials stabilize some enzymes but not others. The overall goal is to understand and develop design rules on how to stabilize enzymes via immobilization to complex synthetic materials. This project will also provide multi-disciplinary training for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. Project results will feed into an annual data science capstone project.\r\n\r\nProtein stabilization can be regulated by tuning the composition of random copolymer brushes to which the protein is attached. A detailed understanding of the molecular basis of this approach is critical. This understanding will be achieved by combining functional stability measurements, single-molecule methods to quantify conformational dynamics (e.g., unfolding and re-folding rates), and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Using this approach, the hypothesis that the chemical properties of the brush layer and enzyme surface should be well-correlated. To systematically test this hypothesis, several closely related, but structurally diverse lipases will be used. Single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer and simulations will be used to distinguish between possible mechanisms of stabilization. Mechanisms to be evaluated via tuning the enzyme-brush interface, will include enhanced re-folding (i.e., a chaperone-like effect) and reduced unfolding. Additionally, the salient chemical features of the brush layer that contribute to the stabilization of enzymes will be identified. This work will leverage a novel algorithm to model and identify clusters of hydrophobic atoms on protein surfaces using unsupervised machine learning. The results of this work are expected to lead to transformational advances in industrial biocatalysis. The impact may extend to other fields, including biosensing, bioremediation, and smart materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
