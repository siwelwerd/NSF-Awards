 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of an improved bolt tightening technology applicable to a wide variety of industries including renewable, power generation, transportation, and infrastructure. The basic bolt-tightening method utilizing a torque-wrench has remained largely unchanged since the introduction of the modern fastener in the 1800s. This results in a preload variation of up to 30% in a multi-bolt joint. New methods, including preload sensing, reduce this variation down to 15% albeit at a high cost. High preload variation leads to inefficient joints, bolt loosening, bolt rupture, and leakage problems over the joint\u2019s lifetime. The proposed innovation can potentially reduce this variation down to 5%, a significant improvement. Additionally, it allows multi-bolt joint tightening in just two passes compared to the current method of four passes which saves time and labor. Successful implementation of the proposed technology will be beneficial in reducing the cost of energy, in particular, offshore wind which is poised for rapid growth in the US. Additionally, it will help prevent hazardous leakage of joints in the nuclear, petrochemical, and oil and gas industries and prevent vibration loosening of joints in the transportation, infrastructure, and heavy machinery industries.\r\n\r\nThe proposed technology combines existing, widely used technologies, such as a torque-wrench and ultrasonic bolt tension measurement, with a unique and proprietary computer algorithm. The proposed innovation offers precise control of bolt tensioning, which is essential for the reliability of multi-bolt flange joints. The fundamental concept is already proven through high-fidelity simulations. In Phase I research, simulation studies will continue on more realistic multi-bolt joints to further validate the algorithm. The primary goal of Phase I research is the experimental validation and optimization of the proposed algorithm. Extensive testing will be conducted on a scaled-down flange joint with the help of ultrasonic preload sensors. The secondary goal is the development of a minimum viable product concept based on this system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The results so far indicate that this concept is novel and very precise but depends on accurate and repeatable preload sensing. Ultrasonic sensing is most appropriate for onsite use since it is non-invasive with high accuracy up to the nearest ?5% in lab settings. Ultrasonic bolt elongation instruments are being used for bolt inspection in wind turbines on a limited basis and by highly trained individuals. This makes it difficult to use off-the-shelf equipment by bolting technicians. This is the primary feedback we received during our customer discovery interviews regarding our proposed solution. Here is a breakdown of key factors that prohibit the immediate application of this technology:</p>\n<p class=\"EHeading3\">1.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usage inaccuracies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Voids in the couplant and variability in the couplant gap height. The couplant is a fluid between the ultrasonic transducer and the bolt to maximize the sonic energy in the bolt. The voids happen due to the method of placing couplant fluid on the bolt head by the end user. Currently, this is carried out manually so it is highly user-dependent. </li>\n<li>The ultrasonic transducer placement pressure is another factor that causes variability. If the magnetic transducer is used, then constant pressure can be maintained. However, initial manual placement can cause variability even with constant magnetic pressure.</li>\n<li>Accurate placement position and orientation of the ultrasonic transducer on the bolt head. The transducer needs to be placed in the same position (x,y,z) and angle                                                   &nbsp;on each bolt. Manual placement is always susceptible to variation. </li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"EHeading3\">1.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UT instrument inaccuracies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Variability of stress along the bolt affects the consistency of sonic velocity.</li>\n<li>Interference of wave paths through the bolt. The state-of-the-art ultrasonic instrument depends on the operator's skill to browse through the signals and find the shortest path. This process needs to be automated by utilizing software and improved post-processing algorithms.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"EHeading3\">1.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fastener imperfections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The sonic velocity is sensitive to the elasticity modulus and density of the bolt which is not well controlled by the bolt manufacturers.
