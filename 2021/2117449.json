 "awd_abstract_narration": "A High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster resource will be built at the University of Kansas (KU) that will advance computational science and engineering at KU and selected Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs). This cluster, nicknamed BigJay, will be part of the KU Community Cluster housed in the state-of-the-art Advanced Computing Facility and maintained by the KU Center for Research Computing (CRC). The major users form a multidisciplinary group from 11 different academic departments/programs at KU: Aerospace Engineering, Bioengineering, Chemistry, Chemical and Petroleum Engineering, Computational Biology, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Geography, Geology, Mathematics, Molecular Biosciences, and Physics & Astronomy. In addition, faculty and undergraduate researchers from four different Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) with ties to KU (The College of St. Scholastica, Prairie View A&M University, Hobart & William Smith College, and the University of Southern Indiana) will have access to the enabled computational resources. Additionally, workshops will be offered by the CRC and participants on cluster use and advanced computational methods, that will also be available to students (and faculty) from KU and the participating PUIs. The proposed HPC resources will enable exposure to HPC techniques to students in graduate and advanced undergraduate courses. Finally, the BigJay cluster will stimulate increased interdisciplinary collaborations centered around HPC, including with the PUI faculty participants. \r\n\r\nBigJay will be made up of a mix of CPU, high-memory CPU, and GPU-enabled processors and include gigabit ethernet and high-speed Infiniband networking. The proposed configuration was chosen to reflect the diverse computing need of the participants. The fundamental research enabled by BigJay will span algorithm development, computational methodology, machine learning, and theoretical descriptions of physical systems. The work will impact problems of importance to society ranging from the development of battery materials to cancer recognition to optimization of catalytic systems, as well as improved theories of physical and biological systems. Interdisciplinary collaborations will be facilitated by the workshops that will introduce students and faculty across disciplines. These will be used as an opportunity to identify commonalities in research topics, numerical methods, and computational tools. Collaborations will also be encouraged by instituting a Computational Research Symposium, consisting of posters and short talks, that will be held biannually for the participants, as well as others who are engaged in computational research on the KU campus. The proposed purchase will substantially enhance HPC research efforts at KU and the PUIs and make participating research groups potentially more competitive for funding from federal, non-profit, or industrial sources. It will further be used to enhance student training in scientific and technical computing through research, the CRC and participant-led workshops, and inclusion of HPC components in graduate and advanced undergraduate courses.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) Directorate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
