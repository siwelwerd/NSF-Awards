 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves increasing the applications of data collection robots using a hybrid system that can both roll and fly. A hybrid system allows for greater mobility and significantly extends operating time, enabling longer missions and accessibility to areas where application of current robotic platforms is limited. One potential application is in crop inspection in agriculture. In such settings, a hybrid system could inspect crops both aerially and at the ground level to detect problems early and thereby increase yields while simultaneously saving resource and labor costs. Other possible inspection applications include mapping the progress of construction projects to identify design discrepancies, scanning for structural integrity flaws in power plants and turbines, and assisting in reconnaissance or search and rescue.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project further develops a hybrid rolling/flying robotic platform.  The system is comprised of a multi-rotor drone system mounted inside a stabilizing unit surrounded by a spherical shell. The system saves significant energy by rolling on the ground and switching to flying to negotiate obstacles or rough surfaces. The system is equipped with a control algorithm that allows it to navigate specified trajectories and also incorporates a real-time algorithm that selects the optimal path in terms of energy consumption, feasibility, and safety. This algorithm then autonomously selects the best mode (rolling or flying) according to the operational environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
