 "awd_abstract_narration": "We often associate pollination with a few external characteristics in bees (e.g., hairiness & tongue length) but bees are complex organisms with a plethora of unstudied morphological and physiological traits (e.g., gut structure, muscular form, and thermal tolerance) that can strongly influence their effectiveness as pollinators. This project will link unstudied, internal morphological traits with bee physiological responses. At its core this work links structure and function with the functional role of bees as pollinators. MicroCT technology will be used to render high-resolution quantitative imagery of internal morphological traits. Honeybees will be used as a model system and the work will be expanded to obtain imaging and an analytical framework of 50 species of wild bees across multiple groups. By linking morphology and physiology with functional diversity, this work has the potential to shape how we think about and manage pollinator biodiversity. This work will provide research and training opportunities to six undergraduate students that will work on microCT imaging techniques, biological data science and experimental biology on the physiology of bees. \r\n\r\nThis project will explore the associations between functional diversity and morphological and physiological traits that directly influence the ecosystem service of pollination provided by bees. The project uses microCT technology to image both honeybees and native wild bees over the course of two years. Specific emphasis is placed on internal morphological traits in relation to bee\u2019s physiological responses (e.g., respiration and thermal tolerance) to environmental stress and thus ultimately impact a bee\u2019s efficacy as a pollinator. The PI and undergraduate research assistants will conduct thermal tolerance and respiration assays on bees to determine potential links of functional trait morphology with important physiological responses. This work will provide workforce development opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
