 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the ecosystem of computing devices (e.g. cellphones, household appliances, vehicles, etc.) connected to each other via the internet. The goal of the Pervasive Personalized Intelligence (PPI) Center is to enable the next generation of IoT systems to be more proactive and personalized without compromising security and privacy, thereby improving decision making, increasing efficiency and enabling new types of computing applications. This proposal will study the feasibility of establishing a new PPI site at the University of Michigan-Dearborn (UM-Dearborn) in collaboration with industry and the two PPI sites at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) and Oregon State University (OSU).\r\n\r\nResearchers at UM-Dearborn will investigate foundational research under three thrusts: Intelligent Transportation, Smart Energy, and Software Engineering Intelligence. First, under the intelligent transportation thrust, investigators will develop new algorithms and techniques enabling personalized and context-aware maneuvering of connected and automated vehicles via artificial intelligence, i.e., intelligent personalization. Second, for the smart energy thrust, investigators will create new techniques that enable novel AI-assisted personalized demand response technologies for electric prosumers. Finally, under the software engineering intelligence thrust, investigators will explore methods to help software developers to build optimized PPI applications that can be efficiently and securely deployed and evolved in cyber-physical systems.\r\n\r\nAdvances in IoT impact many facets of everyday life. The PPI Center explores research thrusts in Artificial Intelligence, Computing Systems, Programmability, Energy, Visualization, and Computer Security and Privacy that are broadly applicable beyond IoT systems to a variety of other scientific domains such as environmental science, agriculture, biology, transportation, and robotics. The research outputs will be disseminated through publications, research presentations to industry and academia, open-source code and industrial collaborations. The PPI Center is committed to broadening participation in computing through, for example, summer schools for industry engineers and K-12 outreach through partnerships with UM-Dearborn\u2019s programs. To improve the retention of underrepresented populations, the proposed Center will work with technology associations to showcase PPI applications that help humanity.\r\n\r\nThe PPI Center will maintain a publicly accessible project repository that will store open-source code, publicly available datasets, papers and other research outputs that can be disseminated to the general public on ppicenter.org.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
