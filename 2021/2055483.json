 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of adaptive physical therapy and exercise equipment that may be used by individuals with varying ranges of physical abilities. There is a large gap in the ability of individuals with mobility impairments, such as neuromuscular disorders, spinal cord injuries, and strokes, to conduct much needed physical therapy and exercise on a regular basis. Once the proposed technology is validated and usable at home, it will significantly increase access to care. The high frequency physical therapy visits required for individuals with physical disabilities often impacts their quality of life. A device that can perform clinically accurate rehabilitation at home or even on the go will enable an increased level of independence and quality of life by limiting the number of visits to the clinic. Additionally, the proposed technology may be used as a research tool during clinical trials of new pharmaceutical therapies for neuromuscular diseases. An increase in patient outcome accuracy and resolution would make it easier to develop new and more effective therapies. The device will be marketed to pharmaceutical companies as a secondary commercial application.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a biomimetic and patient-specific human-machine interface that will increase the comfort of the device during extended use. This will likely increase patient compliance and lead to better data collection and potentially better patient outcomes during rehabilitation. Additionally, accurate alignment of the device will not require a trained professional, enabling the device to be used in a clinic or at home. This will allow for a significant increase in flexibility for patients who need to attend frequent physical therapy sessions.  Finally, the device is powered by off-board motors and batteries to reduce weight and further increase the patient's comfort. Preliminary research and testing have been successfully conducted with end users with spinal muscular atrophy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
