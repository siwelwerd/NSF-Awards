 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program in the Division of Chemistry, Oleg V. Larionov of the University of Texas at San Antonio is developing new catalysts that use the energy of the visible light to enable previously unknown chemical reactions. The new catalysts enable the chemical reactions by selectively breaking chemical bonds that connect specific atoms within large molecules and replacing them with other groups of atoms, producing new and more complex molecules, while generating less waste and expending less non-renewable resources. The new reactions will simplify production of agrochemicals, medicines, and plastics. Additional societal benefits will include training of underrepresented groups in various aspects of chemical research and improvements in the chemical education through the development of an innovative workshop on sustainable technologies.\r\n\r\nProgress in the development of new catalytic transformations requires deeper understanding of mechanistic details of diverse catalytic systems. In this project, Oleg Larionov is advancing the discovery of new catalytic manifolds, enabling efficient and selective functionalizations of strong bonds by radical and radical-ionic pathways that become accessible upon photo-activation with visible light. He and his students are developing new photocatalysts, engaging substrates by means of directional catalyst\u2013substrate interactions that provide the necessary selectivity in a departure from typical non-directional catalytic systems. The research is expected to streamline synthetic access to valuable functionalized materials and will add to the understanding of complex catalytic manifolds including those that will likely underpin future synthetic methodologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
