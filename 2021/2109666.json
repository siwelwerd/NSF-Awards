 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Proteins are industrious molecules that are essential to all life processes. DNA provides instructions for building these proteins: genes in the DNA are converted into RNA template molecules that are translated into protein molecules. However, the number of RNA molecules that are produced from a stretch of DNA (a gene) does not necessarily predict the number of protein molecules produced from that RNA. This imperfect relationship may itself be genetically encoded in DNA, which could provide information about how the genetic encoding of other life processes has evolved. To better understand how RNA and protein levels are genetically encoded in DNA and how this encoding may have come to be, the Fellow will compare RNA and protein produced from two different versions of genes within the same organism using Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes (tiny worms). This study will improve the genetic resources available to the large scientific community that uses C. elegans to study diverse biological processes. This work will also broaden participation in science via engagement and long-term mentorship of a high schooler from a group historically underrepresented in science and via communication of the Fellow\u2019s research and disability-accessible career journey.\r\n\r\nThe Fellow will investigate the molecular steps and evolutionary genomic patterns along the genotype-to-phenotype path by first characterizing the genetic control of RNA expression variation in C. elegans by analyzing allele-specific RNA sequencing data from crosses among five wild-type strains. The project will interrogate the evolutionary patterns underlying RNA expression variation by evaluating population genomic contexts. To test the hypothesis that genetic variants in close proximity buffer expression in the translation of RNA into protein, the Fellow will investigate allele-specific protein levels of a set of candidate genes within individual animals by engineering epitope tags for highly sensitive quantification. The Fellow will be trained for a flexible career in science via expertise expansion, coding and experimental design workshop development and implementation, and long-term mentoring of a high school and potentially undergraduate student; this mentorship will broaden the impact of the research by engaging members of historically underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Differences in DNA sequences can cause differences in the amounts of RNA produced, which can lead to differences in amounts of protein produced and therefore differences in traits among individuals and organisms. However, some DNA differences do not change RNA amounts, while others cause RNA and trait differences in some contexts but not in others. For example, a given DNA change can have a huge impact in one setting but have no impact when located in a different genome (genetic background). We set out to investigate the rules that determine if and how DNA changes impact RNA expression.</p>\n<p>We used the model organism&nbsp;<em>Caenorhabditis elegans&nbsp;</em>nematodes (tiny worms) in this pursuit for two complementary reasons. First, a large research community uses&nbsp;<em>C. elegans</em>&nbsp;to study diverse biological processes, making any genetic rules discerned immediately and broadly useful. Second, this species provides unique access into DNA differences in different genetic contexts and combinations: in nature,&nbsp;<em>C. elegans&nbsp;</em>largely mate with themselves as they produce both sperm and eggs, so their genomes seldom get mixed with genomes from other strains of&nbsp;<em>C. elegans.</em>&nbsp;However, in the lab we can inter-mate&nbsp;<em>C. elegans</em>, combining two genomes that do not typically reside in the same organism to see how DNA changes in new contexts affect RNA amounts produced. We made new hybrid&nbsp;<em>C. elegans&nbsp;</em>worms with two versions of each gene from parents with different amounts of genetic similarity to each other (one example in Image 1), then sequenced the RNA from these hybrids and their parents. By comparing the amount of RNA made from each version of a gene within one hybrid individual (blue and red within purple worm in Image 1), and amount of RNA made from the gene between the parent strains (blue and red worms in Image 1), we built a blueprint connecting DNA contexts to RNA amounts.</p>\n<p>Some genes that produced different amounts of RNA between gene versions within the hybrid worms nonetheless produced the same amount of RNA between the parent worms (where the different gene versions are separate rather than combined; see Images 1 and 2), reinforcing the notion that genetic context plays a large role in determining how and whether the effect of DNA variation is exerted or buffered. Hybrid worms whose parents were more genetically different from each other also had more buffered differences, suggesting that DNA changes? effects were ?tamped down? as more changes accumulated, potentially allowing evolution to be robust to some DNA changes. Additionally, a gene?s location in the genome had a bigger impact on how and whether DNA changes influenced RNA amounts than did the gene?s function: the structure and organization of the genome plays an enormous role in shaping whether DNA changes impact RNA and therefore traits.

These websites provide the research community with easy access to our data and inferences. For example, a lab studying one gene?s role in an important process could use our websites to determine whether that gene produces RNA stably or variably across conditions and DNA changes, lending insight into the gene?s evolution and potentially nominating worm strains better suited for studying the gene.</p>\n<p>This fellowship aims to support the training of the funded postdoctoral fellow and to broaden the scientific workforce and the public?s access to and excitement for science. Accordingly, the fellow expanded access to a key computer programming language used in biological research by designing and teaching an undergraduate workshop and by mentoring individual research projects. She co-founded new initiatives at the Georgia Institute of Technology: an advisory council on postdoctoral and research scientist issues (developing and implementing data-driven initiatives to address vulnerability, lack of community, and discrimination), and a mentorship program connecting graduate student women in the male-dominated computational biology field with one-on-one professional development mentors and with one another. The fellow spoke to and mentored several high school and undergraduate audiences (majority from marginalized groups) about her research and career journey, including explicitly describing navigating a career in academic science while managing a disability.
