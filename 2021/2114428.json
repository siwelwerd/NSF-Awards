 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a wearable electrostimulation hair growth cap. The proposed development of flexible and wearable nanogenerator aims at powering wearable electronic devices from relevant body motions. The goal is to enable the possibility of bypassing the bulky and rigid battery systems that currently hinder the evolution of many electronic therapeutic devices toward a wearable system. It may lead to a platform technology providing self-powered and closed-loop electronics as a new wearable or implantable solution for achieving a variety of biomedical functions, such as health monitoring, information gathering, and providing therapeutic treatments.  Further, the self-powered, closed-loop electrostimulation cap may become an effective solution to cure the hair loss problem that plagues many human beings across a broad age range worldwide with an anticipated global market of $12 billion in 2024.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a self-powered, electrostimulation technology that directly converts biomechanical energy from random human body motions into continuous electric pulses without involving any battery or regulative electronics. Due to its unique energy resource and pulsed bi-phasic electricity form, directly applying the generated electricity to achieve certain therapeutic treatments may becomes effective for hair growth. This technology is distinguished from other battery-driven devices by directly coupling the biomedical functions with biomechanical energy sources, forming a closed loop of both energy flow and function feedback. In such a closed-loop electrostimulation, the stimulations are automatically responsive and synchronized to corresponding body motions, and thus impose efficient therapeutic effects without external manipulations. Successful pre-clinical results have been demonstrated self-powered electrostimulation hair regrowth on rats and nude mice. In addition, the results showed that the technology improved the secretion of a few key growth factors related to hair follicle growth, alleviating hair keratin disorder, and increasing the number of active hair follicles. The proposed technology may bring a wearable, convenient, safe, and cost effective solution to enable electrostimulation treatments to reverse baldness.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In this project, we participated in the virtual training program and conducted more than 200 customer interviews. Our primary interviewees are people who are suffering from hair loss at different age and career stage. We also interviewed salon owners, hairloss practitioners, and dermatologists as potential collaborators. We found out that about 73% of the people who have hairloss, would consider using a hair growth product. 46% of that group of people are not satisfied with the existing solution. The results indicate that there?s a very good opportunity for alternative products. In total, there are 65% of people who have hair loss are willing to try new alternative solutions of hair growth. From all interviews, we identified a few key factors that costumers would consider when purchasing a hair growth product, including price, brand, package, comfortableness, and convenience. These factors are included and analyzed to update our business canvas. We discovered that while ~25% customer is not price sensitive, the willingness of purchasing significantly increased to ~80% when the unit price is lowered to $200. This information is helpful for us to target our manufacturing cost and final product price. Based on the updated business canvas and all the understandings we obtained from costumer interviews, we prepared a SBIR phase I proposal and submitted to NSF. We have decided to continue this commercialization path and will continue seek for federal and private investments to grow the business.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/28/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Xudong&nbsp;Wang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
