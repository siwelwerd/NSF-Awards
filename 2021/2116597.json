 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The University of Mississippi is acquiring a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) imaging microscope to support the research of Professor James Cizdziel and colleagues Carolyn Freiwald, Vijayasankar Raman, Courtney Roper, and Matteo D'Alessio. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of chemistry, energy, materials, biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences, as well as archeology and anthropology. In general, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy measures the intensity of the absorbed or transmitted infrared radiation when it passes through a solid, liquid or gaseous sample. The resulting spectra represent the molecular absorption or transmission of the tested substance. When infrared radiation passes through a compound part of it is absorbed by the constituent molecules which vibrate or rotate at certain frequencies. In a heterogeneous sample this powerful analytical tool is good for identifying chemical composition qualitatively. The information can also be used to create an image of the material composition in a sample. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions.\r\n\r\nThe award of the FTIR imaging microscope is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as environmental and forensic chemistry involving microplastics, atmospheric fine particulates and metabolized drugs. Research in the area of archeology and anthropology is also facilitated by identifying compounds in prehistoric paints and analyzing Mesoamerican artifacts. Studies focused on biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences for studying serum exposed ionic liquids, the role of the active human IGF-1 protein in alterations of ischemic tissues, topical drugs and dietary supplements are also pursued as are those focused on analysis of materials relevant for aerogels, water treatment and solar cells.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The instrument, called LUMOS II, combines optical (light) microscopy with IR spectroscopy. Spectroscopy is the interaction of radiation (light) with matter, and light in the infrared range induces many molecules to vibrate as distinct frequencies.

At least a dozen research groups from UM and Rhodes College have used the instrument to advance research streams in environmental and forensic chemistry, biomedical and pharmaceutical science, archeology and anthropology, and material science. Moreover, the instrument is believed to have helped UM in the recruitment and retention of high-quality students. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Outcomes include at least thirteen peer-reviewed papers which have been published in high-quality scientific journals. Briefly, research outcomes include: a better understanding of the abundance, characteristics, and sources of microplastic pollution in the Mississippi River system, in oysters from Gulf Coast, and in a wastewater treatment plant; the advancement of ionic liquids for transdermal transport and drug delivery; evaluation of the distribution of chemical markers in stroke-damaged tissues; new methods in chemical imaging of trace evidence in forensic investigations and in the study of paint binders in prehistoric rock pictographs.</p>\n<p>New analytical methods were developed to determine the size, shape, and composition of the small plastic particles in different environmental matrices and in biological tissues, including oysters. Oysters serve as an important economic resource to the region and provide many ecosystem benefits, but as filter feeders, they are susceptible to microplastic pollution. The work enabled using the LUMOS II provided much needed empirical data on the abundances and sizes of MPs in oysters from the Mississippi Sound, as well as the tissues where they reside. Further, using the LUMOS II, researchers obtained data needed to (1) help understand risks posed by microplastics, (2) guide policy makers to improve air and water quality, and (3) improve people&rsquo;s education around microplastic pollution. Use of the instrument has also led to a potential economical approach to mitigate microplastic (and other) pollution in both agricultural and urban stormwater runoff using biochar.</p>\n<p>Examining the spatiotemporal characteristics of microplastics in a wastewater treatment plant, researchers demonstrated that flow rates and treatment times can profoundly influence microplastic concentrations in the treated effluent, and that the optimal wastewater treatment conditions also yield the best microplastic removal efficiency.</p>\n<p>In other work, researchers used the instrument to obtain FTIR spectra of tire wear particles (TWPs) providing much-needed empirical data on airborne TWPs along roads with different traffic characteristics.
