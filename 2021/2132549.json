This project is a timely opportunity to leverage the new field station on the atoll of Tetiaroa which has close ties to U.S. institutions through the University of California, including a nearby NSF Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site, as well as international research programs.  \r\n\r\nPlace-based data have a unique quality in that they span the sciences and humanities with time and space (geolocation) acting as foundational metadata used to assign data to \u201cplace\u201d (or nested \u201cplaces\u201d). The FAIR Island Project will build interoperability between pieces of critical research infrastructure -- Data Management Plans (DMPs), research practice, DOIs, and publications contributing to the advancement and adoption of Open Science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
