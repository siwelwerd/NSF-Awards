 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Vanderbilt University will prepare the first generation of students in the emerging field of multimessenger astronomy (MMA).  With the discovery of gravitational waves, there is a new window on the universe and with it, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to launch a new field. The goal of this program is to pilot the Establishing Multimessenger Astronomy Inclusive Training (EMIT) initiative. EMIT will be a transdisciplinary graduate program that promotes diversity and inclusion and produces scholars with the skills needed to drive discoveries in MMA while expanding the STEM workforce. The project will train 300 students from physics, astronomy, math, and engineering, including 19 funded trainees, through new formal curricula, seminars, summer programs, and research. The aim is to build a community of practice that is diverse from the outset through cohort building, shared research experiences, visible underrepresented minority role models, and a suite of evidence-based programming designed to promote inclusive excellence.\r\n \r\nEMIT trainees will learn the interdisciplinary concepts, research techniques, and the conduct of research critical to advance MMA. Using educational research-supported practices, the program will prepare students to take a team science approach while developing transferable skills for transition to the workforce. Some trainees will earn a Master of Science degree at Fisk University, a collaborating institution, and may directly enter employment or go on to join a Ph.D. program. Other trainees will enter Vanderbilt directly in a doctoral program. Regardless of the option chosen, students will earn a graduate certificate in MMA through research, coursework, and outreach. Joint student research between Fisk, Vanderbilt, and external collaborators will bring together new nodes of expertise. These collaborative research projects will complement and enhance the strengths of the partnering institutions. The team will provide stage-specific professional development for the entire student training period.  The program supplements traditional coursework with a novel modular curriculum specific to MMA. Some courses and Blast Modules will be posted on an EMIT YouTube channel to reach the larger community. A summer workshop, open nationally, will occur every other year and broaden understanding of the research needs, promote the skills required for MMA, and further stimulate teaching and communication for EMIT trainees. After earning the graduate certificate, EMIT trainees will help lead this workshop. \r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
