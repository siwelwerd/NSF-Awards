 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers at the University of Wisconsin Trout Lake Station conduct year-round research on lakes in northern Wisconsin, sampling frozen or near freezing waterbodies for at least six months out of the year. Trout Lake Station is a long-time contributor and leader of winter lake research efforts internationally and prides itself on providing an inclusive size selection of high-quality winter safety gear and hands-on training to researchers entering the field. While the expertise and equipment at Trout Lake Station can accommodate additional winter research, training, and outreach; the station lacks a heated workspace where people can escape the freezing temperatures, work to develop new lake sampling technologies, and where existing gear can be properly stored and serviced. Through the construction of a heated year-round research workshop, Trout Lake Station will increase its research and outreach capacity both seasonally and spatially. \r\n\r\nThe Winter Instrumentation Limnology Laboratory (WILL) is a ~3,600 sq ft heated multifunctional research outbuilding composed of three main sections: 1) an active gear staging area, 2) a large workshop/toolshop, and 3) a sensor, buoy platform, and limnological gear makerspace. The building will be a stick and frame design with shop heating that maintains workable temperatures throughout all seasons in a north temperate climate. The WILL is proposed to replace an existing 1,200 sqft non-heated tool workshop. It will triple the outbuilding research workspace and complement the existing 11,200 sqft laboratory and conference building. The winter research user base for TLS stretches beyond the UW-Madison campus, and includes the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR), the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) staff and scientists, Global Lakes Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) researchers, Lake Superior National Estuary Research Reserve (LSNERR), and regional universities. Trout Lake Station aims to become a hub that connects water interest groups in the region. Increasing year-round capacity and providing heated workshop space will strengthen links and collaborations between regional partners.
