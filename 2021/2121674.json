 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) is a new green, non-toxic and bioderived technology for water treatment using membrane filters.  The new membranes will be used to provide safe tap water to local communities. Membrane filtration technologies have been used in water treatment for decades because membranes are easy to fabricate, simple to use, have high selectivity for impurity removal, and do not require the regeneration. The fabrication of membranes using renewable solvents derived from biomass that does not compete with food applications, satisfies both consumer and legislative demands with regard to sustainability. The technology has potential commercial application in water filtration for industrial and household applications. Apart from the impact in these large and growing markets, this innovation may enable new directions at the nexus of food-energy-water systems and eco-manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will establish a green and non-toxic process of fabricating polymeric ultrafiltration membranes using two environmentally friendly and bioderived co-solvents embedded with silver nanoparticles in an innovative one-step process. Research objectives include: (1) preparing solutions comprised of polymer, solvent and silver nanoparticles in a single solution; (2) scaling up the membranes using roll to roll enabled process, (3) determining the purity of the wastewater produced during membrane fabrication especially with regard to the occurrence of any leaching of silver nanoparticles, and (4) operating the prototype membranes in continuous/long-term operation to determine efficiency in the removal of per- and polyfluorinated chemicals (PFAS).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
