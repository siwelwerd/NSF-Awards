 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description:\r\nA scanning probe microscope (SPM) is a scientific instrument that uses a sharp probe to measure surface and interface properties in nanometer and sub-nanometer spatial resolution. The SPM system acquired through this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award has significant impact on the research, education, and training infrastructure at Rowan University and its surrounding area in southern New Jersey. First, this instrument enables collaborative materials research among faculty members, undergraduate and graduate students, and regional industrial participants to conduct ground-breaking research. It allows the establishment of inter- and intra-institutional research collaborations. Second, this instrument helps grow several programs, such as the Materials Science & Engineering program, by providing ample opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students to work on their research projects, coursework, or thesis projects, directly impacting the training of a technical workforce for the region. Third, this instrument is used by many researchers including women and underrepresented minority faculty and students through established university and college programs. This provides better experience, stronger training, and more opportunities for researchers from groups typically underrepresented in science and engineering. Finally, this instrument serves the local needs in advanced materials research and training, resulting in increased interactions with local industries and stronger impact on the economic growth in the region.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThe acquired SPM system combines ultrahigh-resolution imaging, nanoelectrical measurement, nanomechanical characterization, and nanoelectrochemical analysis for the research of various material systems in air, fluid, electrical field, or chemically reactive environment. With these advanced features, the instrument enables research projects in five key research areas: (1) surface morphology and nanomaterials research; (2) functional materials, flexible electronics and sensors; (3) electrochemistry, energy materials and devices, and protective coatings; (4) biological and biomedical materials, life sciences; and (5) additive manufacturing, construction and structural materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The purpose was clear: to procure a state-of-the-art scanning probe microscope (SPM) to bolster multidisciplinary materials research and education.</p>\n<p><strong>Achievements and Impact (9/1/2021 - 8/31/2023):</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>1. Infrastructure      &amp; Collaboration:</strong> The Bruker's Dimension XR SPM system, which was      acquired, has set a new benchmark in research capabilities, including      PeakForce Tapping, DataCube modes, SECM, and AFM-nDMA at Rowan University.      It facilitated inter-college collaborations, fostered cross-campus      interactions, and was a catalyst for several new graduate programs, including      Materials Science and Engineering, Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Civil Engineering,      Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering.<br /><strong>2. Inclusion:</strong> The project made notable strides in increasing the participation of women      and underrepresented minority (URM) students and faculty in STEM      disciplines. Through initiatives like ACS SEED, NSF RED, and ASCEND, URM      students gained hands-on exposure to the SPM, enriching their academic      pursuits.<br /><strong>3. Training      &amp; Education:</strong> Over 200 students annually benefit from the SPM's      integration into the curriculum. Extensive eleven-day training sessions,      spanning three visits, were facilitated by Bruker's experts, equipping      faculty, staff, and students with the needed expertise. Future users will      also benefit from meticulously crafted SPM user guides with visuals.<br /><strong>4. Research      Prowess:</strong> In the short span since its installation, the SPM has      catalyzed groundbreaking research activities. This is evident in the      publication of four peer-reviewed articles and ten noteworthy      presentations. It's not just an instrument, but an integral part of      advanced research, and many more contributions to the world of materials      science are anticipated.<br /><strong>5. Community      Engagement:</strong> Rowan University opened its doors, allowing students and      faculty from neighboring institutions and industrial collaborators to      access the SPM. This step fostered a spirit of knowledge-sharing and      collaborative endeavor.<br /><strong>6. Future      Prospects:</strong> The SPM promises to be a linchpin in future research      endeavors, especially for junior faculty across diverse disciplines.
