 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, located in St. Louis, MO, will support the training of 10 students for 11 weeks during the summers of 2021- 2022. It is anticipated that a total of 20 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. Fostering the next generation of plant scientists is critical to solving some of the planet\u2019s biggest challenges. The Danforth Center is an independent, non-profit private research institute with state-of-the art research facilities and is dedicated to fundamental as well as applied research in plant biology.  In addition to presenting research findings at a final program symposium, many interns will present their work at scientific conferences and will have their work included in scientific publications.  Assessment of the program will be done through on-site interviews and through the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nThe mission of the Danforth Center is to improve human conditions through plant science, a field that has become exceedingly important with growing human population and changing environmental conditions.  Interns will conduct 11-week research projects under the guidance of Danforth Center scientists. Research covers many areas such as abiotic stress, bioenergy, genomics, bioremediation, cellular signaling, translational plant sciences and others. The research component will be supplemented with additional educational activities, including workshops from Danforth Center core facilities, including Advanced Bioimaging Laboratory, Proteomics & Mass Spectrometry, Bioinformatics, Phenotyping, Maker and Tissue Culture and Transformation facilities.  Interns will also participate in workshops/training sessions in Equity Diversity and Inclusivity, implicit bias, and sexual harassment.  Other program components include weekly meetings, a scientific retreat, educational field trips and a career panel which will expose interns to current research topics in the plant sciences, ethics in research, and career path alternatives. Interns will have ample networking opportunities with Danforth Center scientists as well as those from other local institutions. Applications are available online and are due each February. The program runs each summer from May through August.  More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.danforthcenter.org/internship or by contacting internship@danforthcenter.org.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (DDPSC) was funded for a two-year period from 03/01/2021-02/28/2023 under federal award 2050394. The Danforth Center is an independent non-profit private research institute dedicated to fundamental research in plant biology.

As a long running NSF-REU site, we provided a well-rounded, comprehensive internship training for undergraduate students to obtain significant research experience in the areas of plant and life sciences, and in science communication, policy and networking. Students conducted research projects under the mentorship of senior scientists, where they were involved in hypothesis generation, hands on experiments, data recording, interpretation and trouble shooting.

Several events were organized to encourage interactions among interns and other scientists in various career stages at the Center, including a Career Panel.\n\n\n\n\n\nBroader Impacts. Since one of the goals of the Centers research is to have an impact on agricultural productivity and food security, the research conducted by interns has the potential to be of significant interest to the plant biology community and the community at large. The Danforth Center REU program helped prepare students for careers in the fields of plant biology and biotechnology. In addition to the training they received in the lab, our interns interacted with scientists in academia, industries, biotech startups, field biologists, science communicators and patent attorneys. This gave interns an expanded view of the possible careers in science and provided a better understanding of how different disciplines interfaced to work towards solving the problems affecting our world. Our program aimed to increase the diversity of the scientific field by offering extensive research experience and training to students from underrepresented groups, women, and students from smaller colleges that had limited research opportunities. Forty-one percent of our interns were from underrepresented groups, 51% were women, and 41% came from small schools. The program activities were designed to fashion successful future scientists and entrepreneurs. A recent survey of former interns showed that 78% were working in STEM careers or pursuing degrees in STEM.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/14/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SonaPandey\n"
