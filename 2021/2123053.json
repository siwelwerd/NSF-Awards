 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the Tudor Hill Marine Atmospheric Observatory in Bermuda. Because of its location in the western North Atlantic Ocean, Bermuda has been an important location for many studies of the marine atmosphere. The observatory is well equipped for carrying out research, with field laboratories and a 23 meter tower at Tudor Hill. This allows scientists to study the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere over the oceans. This part of the atmosphere plays an important role in the transfer of moisture, chemicals, and energy between the ocean and the atmosphere. Routine work at the site includes the observation and recording of weather conditions, and sampling of rain and air. In addition, samples and data are collected for a number of research partners, including NOAA, NASA and many US and international universities. As well as supporting research, this project will provide a range of educational opportunities, including through the NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, and through other internships and courses at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe continued operation and maintenance of the Tudor Hill Marine Atmospheric Observatory facilitates research concerning the chemistry and physics of the marine troposphere and ocean-atmosphere exchange processes. The specific objectives of the project are to: 1) Operate and maintain the atmospheric sampling facility at Tudor Hill, Bermuda; 2) Continue collection of continuous meteorological data and weekly bulk-aerosol and rain samples, which will be archived at BIOS and made freely available to other researchers; and 3) Collect additional atmospheric samples and data for external investigators, and provide for the use of the facility by external investigators. Ongoing partner activities at the facility include monitoring and data acquisition for NASA (AERONET) and NOAA programs (Ozone and greenhouse gas monitoring), and a new sampling location will be established for the US National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) in 2021. The THMAO site will enable research to be undertaken that is central to international initiatives such as IGAC, SOLAS and GEOTRACES. In a regional context, the Tudor Hill facility will complement ongoing oceanographic time-series research in the Sargasso Sea, including Hydrostation S and BATS.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
