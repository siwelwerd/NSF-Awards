 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Michael Kotlarchyk and colleagues George Thurston, and Pratik Dholabhai at Rochester Institute of Technology are laying the groundwork for development of a powerful next-generation technique to probe structures and dynamics of molecules, molecular assemblies, and solutions.  The targeted technique, based on a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Polarized Neutron Scattering (PNS), has the potential to revolutionize the detailed, molecular-scale information available for a broad variety of materials, including liquid mixtures, catalysts, nanomaterials, and biological macromolecules. The information to be gained is crucial for predicting and rationalizing many processes of industrial, medical, and societal importance. The PIs are actively engaged in programs seeking to enhance STEM engagement by students from underrepresented groups, for involvement in interdisciplinary state-of-the-art research.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on calculational modeling as a foundation for future development of experimental methods. The team is extending the quantum-mechanical density-operator treatment of NMR-PNS to treat spin relaxation, spin coupling, and the incorporation of nuclei with any quantum spin. This will enable the prediction and simulation of PNS cross sections and signal-to-noise ratios for hyperpolarized molecules in solution and for molecules prepared via specialized NMR protocols. Molecular dynamics simulations of molecules hyperpolarized in solution via Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE) are being undertaken to permit quantitative evaluations of site-site spatial correlations in solution, which are essential for predicting the PNS signal and for a rigorous statistical analysis of PNS signal-to-noise.  NMR protocols that apply selective pulse-shaping and sequencing to hyperpolarized molecules will be designed and simulated, thereby enabling use of the correlation functions to evaluate the resulting polarized neutron scattering cross-sections. Finally, complete statistical analyses of putative NMR-PNS protocols for SABRE-hyperpolarized molecules will be performed. The simulated scattering signals will inform the design of effective NMR-PNS instrumentation and experiments, including sample environment, beamline, and detector parameters. The ultimate aim is to determine structure factors between atomic pairs selected via NMR spin-manipulation, from sub-angstrom to micron length scales, thereby giving valuable information about molecular conformations and relative orientations in solution. The SABRE-PNS methods to be developed are important stepping-stones toward full NMR-PNS and will be valuable in their own right.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The technique has the potential to noninvasively probe nanoscale structure, molecular arrangements, and dynamics in liquids with an unprecedented combination of selectivity, high resolution, and spatial range. By manipulating nuclear spins via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to take advantage of the dramatic spin-dependence of polarized neutron scattering (PNS), structures and dynamics of molecules, molecular assemblies, and solutions can be probed. This novel technique of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance - Polarized Neutron Scattering, or NMR-PNS, has the potential to revolutionize the detailed, molecular-scale information available for a broad variety of materials, from liquid mixtures to catalysts to novel nanomaterials to biological macromolecules. The information to be gained is crucial for predicting and rationalizing many processes of industrial, medical, and societal importance including binding, catalysis, and phase transitions.\r\n\n\nDuring this project, the quantum-mechanical treatment of the NMR-PNS technique previously developed by the project PI Kotlarchyk and co-PI Thurston (and published in 2016) was specifically applied to scattering from two prototypical solute molecules, i.e., methyl-nicotinate and thienopyridazine, dissolved in methanol solvent. Modelling the scattering from these particular solute-solvent systems was chosen because other researchers have shown experimentally that very high degrees of hyperpolarization of these solute molecules can be attained in methanol via the technique of Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (or SABRE). That is to say, the solute protons can achieve spin-alignments up to a degree as high as 40-50%. We have extended our 2016 treatment so as to, in a general way, incorporate non-spin-1/2 nuclei (i.e., particularly solute nuclei N14 and H2, both spin-1), whereas our original formulation was only valid for nuclei of quantum spin-1/2. We have also estimated the effects on the scattering signal due to loss of initial spin alignment over time scales of seconds or minutes as the degree of hyperpolarization relaxes towards equilibrium.\r\n\n\nThe most central effort during the funded project was associated with extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations from the above solute-solvent systems so as to make a careful quantitative analysis of all the terms that would occur in the NMR-PNS spin-hyperpolarized system. We found that our simulations yielded scattering signals that enabled reliable estimates of the signal-to-noise ratios and corresponding uncertainties for intramolecular nuclear separation measurements. Briefly, a key outcome of the project was that we found that with the use of currently available neutron fluxes, as well as reasonably anticipated dream fluxes achievable within the foreseeable future, measurement durations of less than two hours would suffice to measure intramolecular nuclear separations to within 2 to 8%. Measurements of this type are central to future proof-of-concept NMR-PNS beamline equipment installations.\r\n\n\nAnother major outcome was that we were able to develop and test a scaling relationship that shows how key parameters of the liquid sample cell, detector pixel size, incident neutron beam flux, and beamline configuration affect the signal-to-noise ratio associated with NMR-PNS scattering measurements. This scaling relationship is essential for the informed design of a prototype proof-of-concept experimental set-up at a national laboratory facility.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/26/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MichaelKotlarchyk\n"
