 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will build on the widespread interest in the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles for Open Science to synthesize and develop a consensus about next steps for the FAIR movement in the U.S. among representative organizations and thought leaders in the country.  The workshop will bring together a diverse group of experts and representative stakeholders from data and research communities, U.S. funders and mission agencies, and science societies, to seek input on the most promising concrete pathways for expanding uptake, integration, and implementation of the FAIR Principles in research practice and services.  \r\n\r\nThe primary aim of the workshop is to produce a scoping report that can serve as an agenda for the most promising strategies and approaches for FAIR capacity development incorporating the voices of academia, government, and industry.  This will be an invitational meeting which will seek diverse participants who are outside the well-known public voices on Research Data Management systems and services, while also including leaders who are working at the intersections of data infrastructure development, domain sciences, and open science.  International partners engaged in related initiatives will also be assembled for perspectives and experiences that will inform US efforts.  The goal for the workshop is to structure it as a series of highly interactive facilitated sessions with specific targeted outcomes that will contribute to the project report.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
