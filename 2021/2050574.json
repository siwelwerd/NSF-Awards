 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Nebraska, located in Lincoln, Nebraska, will support the training for 10 students, for 10 weeks during the summers of 2021- 2023. The program focuses on bioenergy -- the application of molecular and physiologic principles using microbes, algae and plants to create renewable sources of energy to promote a sustainable society. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. One of the greatest challenges facing 21st-century society is finding a sustainable energy supply. Energy is the basis for a large portion of the global economy and, currently, is largely dependent on nonrenewable fossil fuels that contribute significantly to pollution and climate change. This REU project will train students in finding solutions to overcome this challenge. \r\n\r\nFaculty from the School of Biological Sciences, the Center for Plant Science Innovation and other departments will serve as mentors. Diverse and exciting student projects can employ molecular biology, biochemistry and/or genetics to understand energy dynamics in model species. Students are expected to do full-time laboratory research as well as to participate in seminars and various workshops about ethics in research, professionalism, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process. Students will present the results of their work at scientific conferences, tour energy industries and undergo training in technical writing using a student-centered approach. Students are selected based on academic record, research performance, and potential for outstanding research. Assessment will be done using the SALG URSSA online tool to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked to determine their career advancement. More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.unl.edu/summerprogram/research#bioenergy, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Paul Blum at pblum1@unl.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Heriberto Cerutti at hcerutti1@unl.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
