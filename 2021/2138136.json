 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by intermittent urinary catheter use. The main goal is to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with intermittent urinary catheter use, improve quality of life, and significantly reduce the cost to the health care system. This novel intermittent urinary catheter design offers three important advantages, it : eliminates the translocation of bacteria at the urethral opening into the bladder, prevents catheter contamination due to handling, and eliminates frictional stresses imposed on endothelial tissues during catheter insertion. Together, these features are expected to result in a significant reduction of UTI incidence due to intermittent urinary catheter use.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project develops a novel intermittent urinary catheter with a sheath, initially stored on the inside of the catheter, that is deployed over the catheter as it advances up the urethra, resulting in sterile material covering the catheter that remains stationary against the urethra as the catheter advances. Before deployment, the sterile sheath is inside the catheter with only a small portion on the outside covering the tip connected to a flange. As the catheter is pushed forward, the flange stays in place and a sterile barrier in put between the catheter and the urethra. This technology would eliminate bacteria at the urethral meatus from reaching the bladder and eliminate frictional damage to tissues, in addition to reducing concerns of improper handling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
