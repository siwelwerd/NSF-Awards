 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role of quasars (the most energetic objects in the universe) in the formation of galaxies is a key issue in understanding how our universe evolves. The PI's program will measure the influence of powerful outflows, emanating from these quasars, on the formation and evolution of their host galaxy. This project will involve interdisciplinary research opportunities that will significantly contribute to undergraduate education. Over the last 10 years, this group has employed 21 students for a semester or longer, half of them women and under-represented minorities. \r\n\r\nQuasar outflows are invoked as the agents for quasar-mode Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback. Such outflows come in many flavors: molecular, atomic, ionized seen in emission, ionized seen in absorption, and ionized seen in X-ray spectra. The most energetic outflows are ionized outflows seen in UV absorption spectra. Absorption outflows are the main candidates for producing AGN feedback effects. The team\u2019s research project will expand on the progress they have made previously and will add to the understanding of the physics and origin of absorption outflows and their role in galaxy evolution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
