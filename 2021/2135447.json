 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds three conferences that will stimulate new research in the interdisciplinary area of cliometrics, which combines economics, statistics, history, demography, sociology, anthropology, anatomy, and climatology as well as other disciplines to examine core questions about economic theory and the development of modern economies. The conferences bring together young scholars, including graduate students, with a group of excellent senior scholars to engage in workshop sessions that give intensive commentary on early research results. The goal is to improve research quality, promote graduate training, and allow young scholars to build deeper research networks. The result is better scientific knowledge about the evolution and structural dynamics of the U.S. economy and the international economy. The conferences advance science, promote the training of U.S. students in this area, and shed valuable light on how government and business decisions can affect the U.S. economic competitiveness.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of the project was to organize conferences of cliometricians to present their research, interact, and form networks in a supportive environment.  Scholars of all ranks are invited, but there is an emphasis on graduate students and scholars early in their careers.  At the 2018 Conference, 'Egg-timer' sessions were introduced to give additional graduate students a chance to share their research.  These are 10 minute per speaker presentations.  No questions are asked during the sessions, but the sessions precede breaks, where further engagement is encouraged.  The program committee makes an effort to include, both as presenters and attendees, academics from all types of institutions, including those which are less research focused.  Thus, these conferences contribute to the professional development of faculty, and thus the teaching of economics, at a wide range of institutions.  The project helped to fund annual conferences in 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022 and a world congress of cliometrics in 2023 also.  The project also supported the planning of the 2020 conference which had to be cancelled due to the Covid pandemic.\n\n'Cliometrics' is economics in the service of history and history in the service of economics.  Cliometricians apply economic theory and quantitative analysis to a wide range of economic and historical issues. At the simplest level, this consists of making observations of economic behavior and measuring variables relevant to the articulation of or the testing of an economic theory or model. Human experience, however, is complex, and cliometricians also seek to examine the forces underlying the development of institutions and government, in order to understand the long-term patterns of development throughout the world.\n\nCliometric conferences follow a format which has been found to promote intellectual discussion and debate.
