 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the acceleration of a new technology for the destruction of toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS), widely used in firefighting foams and consumer goods. However, they are environmental pollutants, highly toxic to human consumption, and hard to destroy. PFAS do not decompose naturally and are poorly broken down by incineration. Widespread contamination of soil, groundwater, and drinking water at sites near airports, military bases, and manufacturing sites is driving an effort to remove and destroy PFAS toxins. This project will advance a technology for destruction of PFAS-rich wastes in an energy-efficient, scalable, easily deployed manner. \r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project seeks to leverage advanced manufacturing techniques and novel, corrosion-resistant alloys to advance the hydrothermal alkaline treatment (HALT) process for the destruction of PFAS. Hydrothermal processing has historically been plagued by challenges with corrosion and component lifetimes, requiring the use of expensive alloys, replaceable system components, and/or elegant chemical corrosion prevention strategies. However, hydrothermal processes are some of the most effective and efficient technologies for destroying hazardous wastes, such as PFAS. Successfully mitigating the material corrosion challenge would lead to more widespread adoption of hydrothermal processes for waste disposal. This project will leverage advanced manufacturing techniques to test the performance of several corrosion-resistant materials under the harsh, HALT conditions. Use of these corrosion-resistant materials may extend component lifetimes while reducing fabrication costs, reducing component fabrication and system maintenance costs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
