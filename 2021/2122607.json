 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to use a diversity, equity, and inclusion lens to create systemic, transformational change at the University of Texas at El Paso to increase the number of Latinx students, in particular Latina students, who are competitive in STEM careers. To achieve the aim of increased participation in STEM fields at the national level, a cross-cutting and replicable institutional approach that considers learning outcomes, students\u2019 experiences, internal organizational structures, and external influences will be implemented. With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program (HSI Program), the project team will intentionally embed concern for diversity, equity, and inclusion in teaching and learning, professional development, and policies and procedures, seeking to shift culture across the institution. A key aspect of the project to support long term impact is capacity building for research on the interplay between STEM education and \"servingness,\" a conceptual way to understand what it means to move from simply enrolling Latinx students to actually serving them.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to institutionalize the systematic use of data and the authentic engagement of key stakeholders to build sustained change through continuous improvement and to maintain, sustain, and build upon inclusive infrastructure and resources. Project personnel will identify, stratify, organize, present, and distribute data to be used for decision-making. A transformation team coordinated by the Provost\u2019s Office will use those data to recommend, plan, and evaluate action on relevant issues. The institution plans to transform STEM undergraduate education through changes in core curricula that provide equitable opportunities to students. In a revitalization of the curriculum, working groups of faculty will develop modular materials for inclusion in the University core to increase inclusive instruction, STEM competencies, and engagement. The Center for Faculty Leadership and Development will implement a professional development series on inclusive and asset-based pedagogy. The administration will work to select, compensate, develop, and mentor future faculty leaders invested in diversity, equity, and inclusion. The Provost\u2019s Office will work with administration and the Faculty Senate to codify policies and procedures that recognize faculty and staff efforts in inclusive teaching and learning. The project will increase publications on metrics-based planning; promote regular use of metrics and research by deans, chairs, and program directors in planning and improving interventions; enhance the ability of stakeholders to understand multiple perspectives on data through visualization; and expand shared understanding of effective practices. Changes will be institutionalized and sustained through policies and procedures that recognize and reward faculty and staff who focus on student success and servingness. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of the HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research (i) on engaged student learning, (ii) about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, and (iii) that improves our understanding of how to build institutional capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also draw from these approaches to generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
