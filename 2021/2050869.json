 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Texas at Dallas focuses on software safety and reliability, which are critical for safe and dependable operation of many systems and the reduction of devastating accidents. It offers innovative research opportunities on these important topics, especially to students from underrepresented groups or universities with limited resources. By enhancing skills through workshops and lectures in critical thinking, oral and written communication, problem solving, and research methods, students will be encouraged and well equipped for graduate education and research careers in science and technology. Interactions with mentors and fellow participants will provide avenues to exchange ideas and stimulate discussions. Research connections will be established with students' home institutions to continue collaboration among multiple institutions in different geographical regions. An REU website will publicize research articles, videos and slides of lectures and project presentations, as well as announcements for effective community outreach.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this research is on evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of existing methodologies and current practices for safety assurance and reliability modeling and prediction. Issues to be explored include: how the introduction of software safety and reliability requirements may affect the software lifecycle; how software processes, techniques, and tool support should be adjusted accordingly; how safe software systems can be unreliable; how reliable software systems can be unsafe; and how to make software systems both safe and reliable. Software for blockchain-based smart contracts and autonomous systems like self-driving vehicles will be emphasized. The findings will be compiled to provide a comprehensive guideline of how software safety and reliability can be achieved effectively and efficiently. A key aspect of this site is the close collaboration with industry. REU students will take trips to industry sponsors, allowing them to speak directly with practitioners to better understand how software safety and reliability is applied to real-life applications. Workshops on technical writing and oral presentation will be held to improve proficiency in preparing and delivering technical reports. Seminars on ethics and professional responsibility will also be given to ensure REU students behave properly and respectfully.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
