 "awd_abstract_narration": "Visualization of biomacromolecules at atomic resolutions provides important information\r\nfor the in-depth understanding of the fundamental biological processes and the rules of life.\r\nTraditionally, X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance have been the only two\r\navailable structural tools that can experimentally determine three-dimensional (3D) structures of\r\nbiomacromolecules at atomic levels. Recent advances in the instrumentation and methodology of\r\nthe advanced microscopy technique called single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is\r\na game-changer for molecular visualization. The cryo-EM technique has become the preferred\r\ntechnique for determining the 3D structure of large macromolecular complex or membrane\r\nproteins that have been dauntingly challenging to either of the two conventional structural\r\ntechniques. This fellowship will support the PI to develop the cryo-EM expertise at the Cryo-EM\r\nCenter of the California Institute of Technology and apply the cryo-EM technique to the structural\r\ncharacterization of biomolecules at the atomic level. Adding cryo-EM to the PI\u2019s structural toolbox\r\nwill not only stimulate new research directions in the PI\u2019s research group at the University of\r\nNebraska-Lincoln, but also benefit many research groups across the state of Nebraska, which is\r\nthe only state that hosts a Big10 university but without expertise or instrumentation for cryo-EM.\r\n\r\nWith the support of this fellowship, the PI and her group member will receive\r\ncomprehensive training on structural characterization of metalloproteins and assemblies by cryo-\r\nEM, from grid preparation, image collection to 3D map construction and model development. In\r\nparticular, this project will focus on the structural investigation of two families of interconnected\r\nmetalloproteins involved in bacterial redox stress response and transition metal homeostasis,\r\nrespectively. The expertise in cryo-EM acquired from this training will propel the PI\u2019s group to\r\nsuccessfully achieve research goals in both the short and long term. The structural information\r\nresulted from the proposal will fill critical gaps in fundamental structural principles that govern\r\nthe metalloproteins in the bacterial response to biotic and abiotic redox stresses and antibiotic\r\nresistance. In the long run, adding the cryo-EM expertise to the PI\u2019s interdisciplinary skillset will\r\nbetter position the PI to play a leading role in structure-mechanism investigations of\r\nmetalloproteins in redox biology. From an educational aspect, this proposal will provide direct\r\ntraining opportunities to graduate students and postdocs using the cryo-EM technique. In addition,\r\nthe acquired knowledge of the application of cryo-EM will be integrated into the teaching and\r\ntraining activities conducted by the PI at UNL, aligning with the educational goal in the PI\u2019s NSF\r\nCAREER award. Furthermore, by working with the colleagues at the University of Nebraska\r\nsystem, the PI\u2019s cryo-EM expertise will enable new research explorations and catalyze new\r\ncollaboration across the campus and promote innovation research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
