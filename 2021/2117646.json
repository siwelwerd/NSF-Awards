 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description:\r\nA magneto optic Kerr effect (MOKE) microscope is based on the principle that when light is reflected from a magnetic surface, the magnetization components of the surface affect the polarization or intensity of the reflected light. When integrated with a camera, one can visualize the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetization orientation in different regions of the sample. The Kerr effect is a powerful tool in understanding the magnetic behavior of bulk materials and thin films, studying exotic magnetic states, and characterizing small magnetic devices. Such magnetic devices have applications in computer memory, computing, communications, energy conversion, solid-state microcooling systems, etc. The acquisition of a MOKE microscope benefits several research groups at the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and nearby universities, industries and laboratories and promotes further collaboration among them. In addition, it facilitates the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in cutting-edge interdisciplinary research and magnetism-related K-12 outreach activities, including summer research experience for K-12 students from under-represented groups. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThe room-temperature MOKE microscope purchased with this major research instrumentation (MRI) grant has high resolution imaging capability. It includes a white light source that allows for domain imaging under standard sensitivity conditions (polar, longitudinal and transverse MOKE) as well as blue- and red-light sources for materials that are more sensitive to these wavelengths and electromagnets for independent control of in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields over a large range (up to 1.3 T). The research benefited from this acquisition includes nanoscale magnetism, skyrmions, voltage control of magnetism, multiferroic piezoelectric-magnetostrictive composites, straintronic spin-wave nano-antennas amenable to miniaturization, topological insulators, chiral materials, non-collinear antiferromagnets, magnetoelectric, magnetocaloric, magnetic hyperthermia and magneto-optic properties. The applications of these research activities include energy-efficient nanomagnetic computing and communication, magnetocaloric cooling, and magnetic nanoparticle-based biomedical and catalysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
