 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Initiation Awards provide support for junior and mid-career faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building new research programs or redirecting and rebuilding existing research programs. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improve research and teaching at the home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Fayetteville State University provides an opportunity to enhance genetic and genomic capabilities at the institution. Bioactive molecules in soybeans will be studied.  Students will be trained to gain experience in field research, bioinformatics, computer programming, genomics, and proteomics and receive training in the use of state-of-the art equipment.\r\n\r\nSoybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] seeds contain a variety of phytochemicals that have potential health benefits. As one of the bioactive molecules in soybean seeds, lunasin has shown remarkable cancer\u2013preventive properties, antioxidant, and hypocholesterolemic effects in animal and in vitro trials. However, the genetic bases of lunasin inheritance and candidate genes for lunasin production in soybean have not been investigated genetically to the best of our knowledge. This research is aimed at: (1) identify genetic variants including quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) and their associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for lunasin contents in the soybean germplasm collection using multi-locus genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach, (2) select elite lines from the mapping panel with high and stable lunasin contents for soybean trait improvement, (3) analyze candidate gene expression to validate QTNs for lunasin productions in soybean plants. The information of QTNs and SNP markers associated with lunasin contents will be used in molecular breeding programs to produce elite soybean cultivars with better seed quality and cancer prevention. The findings of the proposed studies will seal the gap between advanced clinical therapeutic success and lack of genetic information for lunasin inheritance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
