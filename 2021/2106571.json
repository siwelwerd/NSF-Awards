 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects support the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. This project at Jackson State University intends to involve undergraduate students in original research problems during their coursework. It is expected that the undergraduate curriculum in Engineering will be enhanced and students will have increased academic confidence and a deeper understanding of STEM knowledge. \r\n\r\nThis proposed project aims to include cutting-edge course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) for undergraduate students at an HBCU so that they can succeed in STEM. The project goals are: (1) to promote African American students\u2019 persistence and success in various STEM disciplines through CUREs; (2) to help African American students become more engaged in STEM learning and make research accessible to a more diverse group; (3) to improve students\u2019 creativity, analytical, and problem-solving skills, and (4) to inspire African American students\u2019 desire to pursue a higher level of education in STEM.  The proposed CUREs models can be expanded to other HBCUs and the engineering education community to help minority students succeed in not only the STEM classroom but also in STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
