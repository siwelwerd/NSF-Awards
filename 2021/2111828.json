 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large part of computer science is the discovery and transition to practice of new concepts, advances in performance, and derivation of foundational principles. However, another essential part of the computer science agenda is to understand the behavior of large systems that arise from our earlier innovation. The Internet is the best example of a computer science artifact so complex that its behavior cannot be derived from the specification of its components. One has to measure to see how it is behaving. For this reason, measurement needs to be an essential component of the portfolio of computer science research.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this workshop is to identify critical research questions that warrant a call for network measurement (broadly defined), identify barriers and facilitators of that research, and discuss how research results can have impact beyond the research community. This workshop will focus on the identification of critical questions about the Internet that justify research, exploration of barriers to successful execution of that research, and collective activities that might facilitate that research. Long-term data collection and persistent infrastructure foster reproducibility and repeatability, robustness, and extensibility of research results. Typical topics for network measurement include (but not limited to) performance, security, privacy, stability and resilience, growth, censorship, economics, and neutrality as well as spanning broader technological areas such as broadband wireless, cloud and data centers, mobile, new edge devices or underserved regions.\r\n\r\nThe workshop activities can be found at https://www.caida.org/workshops/wombir/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
