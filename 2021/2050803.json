 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate and is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. It has both scientific and societal benefits, and integrates research and education. This REU site focuses on Interdisciplinary Mind and Brain Studies at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), and is run by MindCORE, Penn\u2019s hub for the integrative study of the mind. The program provides a ten-week summer research experience for students that combines the opportunity to work on a research project in an established research lab with an introductory workshop, and closes with a series of student project presentations. Student research will focus on various aspects of how the human mind works, integrating insights from multiple disciplinary approaches, from neurobiology to psychology and linguistics, to philosophy and computer science. The primary objective of the program is to provide a diverse set of students--from underrepresented groups in science and non-research colleges--an experience of in-depth and hands-on research. This, together with providing students with broader knowledge of the field, important technical and professional skills, and connections to cognitive science faculty and labs at the forefront of research, will prepare them for pursuing future graduate studies to become full-fledged members of the research community in this important area, and help progress the understanding of human behavior.\r\n\r\nThis REU site aims to work towards a more diverse and equitable future for the field of mind and brain studies, by providing an integrated research, learning, and mentoring opportunity for students from underrepresented backgrounds in the sciences. It aims to introduce students to a broad and interdisciplinary perspective in a way that leads them to see themselves as active contributors to a larger endeavor to understand the nature of human intelligence and behavior. During the lab internship, students explore their own research question, supported by a faculty mentor from a pool of select Penn MindCORE faculty whose work relates to topics in perception, learning, decision-making, communication and social behavior. By participating, students have the opportunity to explore interdisciplinary connections and perspectives in cognitive science in a collaborative and supportive environment. Programming will be designed according to principles of Inclusive Teaching, with students participating in themed seminars, professional development sessions, technical workshops, lab tours, and journal club meetings with a step-ahead mentor. By conducting in-depth research on a specific question with a MindCORE mentor in a key research area, along with extensive scaffolding through ongoing mentorship, support, and professional development and research skills training, the program aims to ensure that students have a positive research and learning experience that increases both their interest and ability in continuing in research careers and competing for admission to graduate programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
