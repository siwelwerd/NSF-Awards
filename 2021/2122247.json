 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many complex environmental problems \u2013 such as habitat conservation and water pollution \u2013 are managed today through voluntary partnerships of public agencies, nonprofit organizations, and private actors.  In the 20th Century, it was common for public agencies to address environmental problems individually, with little assistance from other agencies and limited input from citizens and other actors.  In the 21st Century, public agencies have increasingly participated in collaborative partnerships for managing environmental problems as a means for sharing management responsibility across jurisdictions and involving non-governmental actors in developing plans and projects. This new means for addressing environmental problems is known as collaborative governance. While the move from centralized planning and regulation to collaborative governance can promote fairness, trust building, and inclusion of different types of knowledge, it may reduce the impact of scientific findings on policies. At present, little is known about how science informs decision making within collaborative partnerships. By comparison, academics have long studied how science is used in public agencies, which are under legal obligations to justify their decisions based on science. Collaborative partnerships, by contrast, are not under similar legal obligations. It is thus important to understand how science informs decision making within these partnerships, particularly given the important role that scientific knowledge and evidence should play in addressing environmental problems. This research project will build academic understanding of how science is used in collaborative partnerships and provide policy makers and agency managers with guidance on generating usable science that can be employed in collaborative partnerships to improve environmental conditions and human wellbeing.   \r\n\r\nThe project seeks to answer the following two questions: (1) How is scientific research valued, acquired, evaluated, and applied in collaborative environmental governance? (2) What are the impacts of these current practices? The empirical focus is Puget Sound, the second-largest estuary in the United States.  Drawing on surveys, interviews, document analysis, and meeting observations, the research team will compare how science is used in different types of partnerships, ranging from partnerships comprised mainly of citizens operating at the local level to partnerships comprised primarily of government agencies operating at larger scales. Within each partnership, surveys and interviews will be conducted to understand how participants think about the role science should play, and does play, in their partnerships. Document analysis and meeting observations will provide additional data to examine the mechanisms through which science is used to inform decision-making processes in each partnership.  The project will build theory by testing hypotheses synthesized from the fields of collaborative governance and the interface between science and policy. In addition, results will be used to identify practical strategies to enhance links between science and collaborative governance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To meet these challenges, we increasingly seek science-based solutions as well as inclusive processes to collaborate across stakeholders. For example, Federal and state agencies in the Puget Sound, Chesapeake Bay, Everglades, Great Lakes, Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, Gulf of Mexico, and numerous inland regions invest heavily in science and science-based ecosystem restoration plans and projects that are typically collaborative in nature. But how is scientific information acquired, evaluated, and applied in collaborative efforts, and how does such information sit alongside other forms of knowledge?\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nOur project used multiple methods to examine the use of science in collaborative governance of environmental protection efforts in the Puget Sound, the second-largest estuary in the United States. We interviewed 39 collaborative participants and conducted a survey of nearly 300 members across 50 organizations in the region. Our analyses generated intellectual contributions through 19 presentations to regional, national, and international audiences in Beijing, Seattle, Portland, Phoenix, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Montreal, Bloomington (IN), Syracuse (NY), Utrecht (Netherlands), Nairobi (Kenya), University of Canterbury (Christchurch, NZ), Stanford University, and the Salish Sea Ecosystem Conference (virtual). These papers focused on topics such as knowledge brokering, inclusion management, cross-scale information, usable science, and power dynamics. We have submitted 3 articles to peer-reviewed scientific journals and have 3 more in progress to be submitted in the coming months.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe project also generated information useful for policy makers, managers, and scientists to assess the effectiveness of their efforts to incorporate scientific and other information. Our stakeholder advisory board provided insights for data collection and analysis and for disseminating findings. We communicated project results in a variety of ways, including to practitioners at lunch and learn and speed date with a scientist events. We prepared and made 8 presentations to practitioner groups (Puget Sound Partnership Social Sciences Advisory Committee, Northwest Straits Commission, West Sound Partners for Ecosystem Recovery, Puyallup River Watershed Council, Puget Sound Partnership Science Panel, Puget Sound Partnership Executive Committee, Puget Sound Ecosystem Monitoring Program, Skagit Marine Resources Committee). We wrote a summary report for stakeholders, which we gave to over 50 collaborative partnerships in the Puget Sound Region.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: TomasMKoontz\n"
