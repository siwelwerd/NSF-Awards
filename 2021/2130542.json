 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of academically talented, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Everett Community College. Over its six-year duration, this project will provide scholarships to approximately 60 unique students who are pursuing an associate\u2019s degree in biology, computer science, chemistry, engineering, environmental science, geology, mathematics and or physics.  Scholars will build community through regular gatherings and will explore opportunities through project-based learning opportunities, a \u201ctransfer roundtable\u201d seminar series, and visits to industry partners.  Central to the projects efforts is a purposeful offering of faculty and staff development along with alumni, peer and faculty mentorship of scholars. The project will also design Academic Excellence Workshops (AEWs) to support student outcomes in early physics, chemistry, biology, computer science and engineering courses.  Already in place to support students in mathematics courses, AEWs are 1-credit seminars where scholars will be able to gain extra additional exposure to particularly challenging topics in parallel with an associated class.  \r\n\r\nEach of the project components will be adapted or newly designed by a diverse team of faculty and staff to support increased retention, completion and transfer rates of talented, low-income community college STEM students.  Faculty and staff will engage in professional development designed to promote collaboration and build a shared understanding of scholars\u2019 experiences, strengths and needs.  Professional development will be organized each year around a theme selected to encourage deeper consideration of how the project might promote equity through curriculum design, enhanced advising practices, and other community-building activities. This shared experience will allow participating faculty and staff to refine and strengthen key sources of academic, social and professional support. In addition, career exposure through engagement with community partners, professional development workshops and activities will give talented STEM students the skills and support necessary to succeed in a demanding curriculum and draw them into the excitement of science rooted in equitable participation for all. Courses, program elements, and support services created or modified for the purpose of this program will be carefully evaluated to assess their impact on student recruitment, learning, and either transfer to a 4-year institution or placement in the workforce. This program will further investigate how impactful an equity-infused student experience is on a student\u2019s trajectory in STEM and life choices. This project is funded by NSF\u2019s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
