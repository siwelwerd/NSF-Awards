 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative effort will contribute to the interagency-supported Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) program, that includes the NSF-funded Sustainably Navigating Arctic Pollution Through Engaging Communities (SNAP-TEC) project. This project focuses on chemical mechanisms for the conversion of sulfur dioxide to particulate sulfate under the cold, low-light conditions in Fairbanks Alaska. This research also will investigate the ability of snow chemistry to affect air quality. The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of the chemical mechanisms for forming air pollution in northerly regions, such as in Fairbanks. \r\n\r\nThe following two hypotheses will be examined through a combination of field, laboratory, and modeling studies: (1) Brown carbon drives the oxidation of S(IV) to particle sulfate through reactions involving BrC-derived triplet excited states (3C*) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); and (2) The persistent winter snowpack has a significant influence on the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere (e.g., through release of HONO), as well as on the processing of sulfur and nitrogen. \r\n\r\nOne of the broader impacts of this research includes the development of science modules for local middle school students. The modules will be made freely available to teachers, homeschooling parents, and self-guided students. For the homeschooling audience, the PIs plan to supplement the activities with projects that utilize data from air monitoring networks that leverage active-learning principles. The homeschooling sub-focus is particularly important for Alaska Native and American Indian populations, who rely on homeschooling much more than other groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
