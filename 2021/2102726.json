 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program establishes new methods to analyze and predict chromosomal organization and  dynamics  in  living  cells.   Furthermore,  the  foundational  theoretical  development  in  this  research  program  is  transferable  to  a  broad  range  of  biological  processes  that  are  driven  by  non-equilibrium  active forces.  In addition, the specific biological processes that the PI will tackle provide new fundamental insight in top phenomena that are central to our understanding of chromosomal organization and function.  Reproduction and epigenetic regulation represent two of the most critical defining features in human biology.  This research  program  brings  quantitative  physical  insight  into  the  molecular  origins  of  how  we  reproduce  and how we establish and maintain our multi-cellular programming, providing fundamental insight and predictive tools for interpreting experimental measurements. This research program is defined by several key deliverables that provide educational resources that impact a  range  of  communities. The educational  program  includes  the  establishment  of  LABScI  (Laboratory  Activities for Broadened Scientific Instruction) to develop and implement laboratory science and engineering teaching modules for high school students that are being treated for childhood cancer and other illnesses. The LABScI program engages undergraduate and graduate students to develop the teaching modules, resulting in an exciting opportunity for students to enrich their educational experience. The PI will partner with the School of Education at Stanford University to expand the LACScI program and develop educational materials that effectively integrate online education with hands-on laboratory activities. New software development in  the PI's  lab  aims  to  consolidate  computational  approaches  in  physics-based  modeling,  genomic and bioinformatic analysis,  and data-science methods.  Coupled to the software development is an effort to provide educational resources that aid the implementation of these disparate approaches.  New efforts in education aim to demonstrate how to effectively integrate physics-based and data-science approaches as complementary tools for biological analysis.\r\n\r\nThe  instructions  for  all  biological  processes  in  human  cells  are  contained  within  chromosomes  whose  total  DNA  length  is  roughly  one  meter.   These  massive  DNA  polymers  must  be  capable  of  organizing  and rearranging  in  response  to  cell-cycle  events  that  are  central  to  biological  function. The PIs  existing  theory  of polymer  dynamics  provides  a  starting  point  for  describing  chromosomal  behavior,  but  a  range  of  distinct biophysical mechanisms contribute to the behavior in living cells that are not currently captured within the existing theoretical models.  Numerous experimental observations demonstrate that chromosomal organization and dynamics are dramatically influenced by enzymes that manipulate DNA twist and supercoiling, mitigate entanglements and knots, and contribute active biological forces. This research program will establish a theoretical and computational framework for predicting and analyzing these critical biophysical drivers of chromosomal behavior.  In establishing theory that is transferable to a broad range of biological processes, the PI will focus on the following three key cell-cycle events: pairing  of  homologous  chromosomes  during  meiosis,  introduction  of  twist  and  supercoiling  during  RNA transcription,  and  the  establishment  of  chromosome  territories  after  cell  division.  Within  this  program,  the PI will tackle one of the prevailing challenges in establishing a physical framework for living systems\u2014establishing a  unified  predictive  theory  for  non-equilibrium  matter.   In  this  effort, he will  develop  a  new  theory  of  active-Brownian matter that provides a clear pathway for prediction of the role of transient enzymatic fluctuations in driving biological processes.  This theoretical approach reveals a prevailing concept\u2014the time-dependent temperature\u2014that serves as a consolidating framework for capturing non-equilibrium behavior in living bio-logical systems, and will exploit this theoretical approach in specific problems that are central to the understanding of chromosomal biophysics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
