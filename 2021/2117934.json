 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Colorado State University is acquiring a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF-TOF) mass spectrometer to support Professor Travis Bailey and colleagues Claudia Boot, Karolien Denef and Garrett Miyake. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex samples. MALDI TOF combines gentle ionization (ideal for producing intact ions of peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, synthetic polymers, and other similarly sized species) with a detection mode that offers an excellent balance between sensitivity and accuracy across a wide mass range. This highly sensitive technique allows identification and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. In the time-of-flight (TOF) method of mass spectrometry, the mass-to-charge ratio of an ion is determined by the way in which ions are accelerated by an electric field of known strength. The velocity of the ion depends on the mass-to-charge ratio (heavier ions of the same charge reach lower speeds). The time that the ions take to reach a detector at a known distance is measured. This time depends on the velocity of the ion, and therefore is a measure of its mass-to-charge ratio. From this ratio and known experimental parameters, the ion can be characterized. The tandem capabilities (TOF-TOF) increase the characterization capabilities. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students with this modern analytical technique. It is also used by collaborators at the various campuses and other regional institutions. The MALDI-TOF-TOF is also employed by undergraduate and graduate students. It is also used in a postdoc instrumentalist training program and annual schools on instrumental methods.\r\n\r\nThe award of the MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It is especially useful for studies in the development of biological imaging tools and identifying synthesized biological tissues. The instrumentation is also used for controling pharmaceutical delivery agents and nanocarriers and studying heat-reflective coatings. The instrument serves researchers preparing metal-free catalysts and high-value self-sustainable polymers and those using diagnostics and drugs to potentially fight infectious disease. The mass spectrometer is also utilized in the preparation of efficient carbon capture membranes and for the study of blood compatible surfaces and polymeric wound healing scaffolds. Additionally, it is employed in characterizing prepared advanced hydrogel networks and for studying energy storage materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
