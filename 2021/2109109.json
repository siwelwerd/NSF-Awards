 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This research will integrate from genes to the environment to understand nutrient foraging in honey bees. A honey bee colony is made up of thousands of bees that work together to complete tasks such as foraging for food. Foraging is influenced by several interacting factors, including the environment (food availability), colony (social cues related to food supply and demand), individual bees (food preferences/ foraging behaviors), and the underlying physical conditions/ genes driving individual behaviors. Understanding how each of these factors influences foraging and nutrition could provide beekeepers with ways to support colony nutrition (e.g., colony-tailored diets). Poor nutrition is a key stressor underlying declining pollinator health, so improving honey bee nutrition would support crop pollination. More broadly, understanding how foraging for nutrients is regulated in these multi-level systems will deepen our understanding of nutrition, animal behavior (particularly foraging), and the evolution of social groups in other biological systems. To broaden participation, the fellow will mentor two undergraduates from groups underrepresented in STEM during this project.\r\n\r\nTo determine the effect of colony-level social cues and the forage environment on pollen foraging, this research will assess the protein and lipid content and taxonomic identity of pollen collected by colonies with different amounts of brood (developing larvae) and at different times during the summer. Then, to determine how colonies adjust foraging behavior of individual bees to respond to changing environmental foraging conditions, the fellow will monitor individual forager behavior under different nutrient stress conditions in foraging arenas. Foragers from this experiment will be collected and their transcriptome will be assessed to determine the genes underlying individual foraging preferences and if these genes are responsive to environmental conditions. To determine how individual physiology and colony social cues interact to influence individual gene expression and foraging preference, a cohort of foragers will be fatty-acid synthesis inhibited and observed in the foraging arenas under different nutrient stress conditions. Results from this research will be disseminated through scientific and stakeholder articles, conferences, and outreach. The fellow will gain career training in molecular techniques and Bayesian statistical analysis. She will also enhance her teaching/mentoring and broaden her professional network.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Honey bees obtain dietary protein and lipids from the pollen of flowering plants. While a honey bee colony is made up of thousands of bees, only a subset, the foragers, collect food from the surrounding environment. The foraging decisions that these bees make is likely influenced by the environment (flowering resources in the surrounding habitat, seasonal environmental cues), the social environment (colony-level needs, colony demography), and the individual forager (individual preferences, likely shaped by experience and physiology). Through this research, Quinlan integrated across these scales to understand honey bee foraging behaviors. She found that, in the field, foraging is primarily constrained by the seasonal environmental availability of nutrients, rather than driven by colony demography. Quinlan observed strong temporal trends in foraged protein among free-flying colonies, with more protein-rich pollen collected in summer than fall. Under choice-test conditions, however, foragers showed consistent preferences for low protein: lipid diets, regardless of season. This suggests that foragers can distinguish diet nutritional quality and have dietary preferences that may not always be met in their foraging environment. Quinlan also found seasonal changes in protein: carbohydrate foraging whereby foragers emphasize carbohydrates relative to protein in fall compared to summer, a previously undescribed finding that could help understand what triggers colonies to physiologically transition to long-lived winter bees. The balancing of proteins: lipids by foragers does not seem to be influenced by past colony experience. Quinlan found that restricting colonies&rsquo; access one nutrient for a short period of time did not result in foragers over-compensating for the missing nutrient. Rather, as a group, foragers showed remarkably conserved balance of nutrients across time. Quinlan found that this balance seems to be achieved by some forager preference for high-protein diets and other foragers&rsquo; preference for high lipid diets, which results in the colony balancing proteins: lipids, overall. When investigating the underlying mechanism of these preferences, preliminary results suggest that foragers with smaller fat bodies show higher preference for lipid-rich diets. Quinlan was able to experimentally induce this effect by feeding the bees a fatty acid synthesis inhibitor, which artificially shrunk the size of their fat body. Foraging decisions made by these manipulated bees, as would exist in nature under <em>Varroa destructor</em> parasitization, could disrupt the colony&rsquo;s ability to achieve balanced nutrition.</p>\n<p>This work contributes new understanding to honey bee biology and has broader impacts for the fields of behavior, social evolution in insects and other organisms, and nutritional ecology. Information gleaned from this work is likely to have applied implications for the management of honey bees, particularly nutrition management, including the development of enhanced artificial diets. Improved honey bee nutrition is likely to contribute to enhanced overwintering success and pollination efficiency, with broader societal impacts for agricultural production and sustainability. In addition to these impact for basic and applied science, this Fellowship provided Quinlan with career training in Bayesian statistical analysis and a broad foundation in molecular techniques. From this foundation, Quinlan trained three undergraduates from underrepresented groups and mentored several graduate students.
