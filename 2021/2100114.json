 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will address the well-documented need for skilled Cybersecurity technicians in the MetroWest and Greater Boston regions of Massachusetts. Moreover, the project team aims to increase the racial and gender diversity of the overall Cybersecurity workforce that will satisfy those local workforce demands. A replicable and sustainable educational ecosystem will be developed that will recruit, retain, and graduate students in the Cybersecurity program at MassBay Community College. Through collaborations with regional industry and high school partners, the program will encourage high school students to pursue degrees, and careers, in Cybersecurity. Retention efforts will ensure that students majoring in Cybersecurity achieve a mastery of the knowledge and the practical skills needed to meet industry expectations. Students will be provided with mentoring, career advice and support, and internship opportunities to ensure their success and entry into the Cybersecurity workforce. \r\n\r\nThe educational experience provided by MassBay will be based on the development of a \"Cyber Range,\" which is an Internet-based computer network platform that provides students with hands-on experience in Cybersecurity. Exercises will be developed to give high school and college students practical experiences in Cybersecurity. These exercises will be developed in collaboration with industry partners, using their security products, to provide students with real-world experiences in Cybersecurity. The project's Cyber Range will be used to create workshop activities for high school students, develop training materials to instruct and educate students to become peer-mentors, and offer train-the trainer workshops to high school teachers and MassBay faculty.  High schools, youth serving organizations, and industry partners will use the Cyber Range to host cyber competitions, hackathons, mentoring, and internships to make students aware of and motivate them to pursue degrees in Cybersecurity. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

A CR is a virtual network environment that enables students to conduct security exercises in a secure and secluded environment.</p>\r\n<p>We solved this problem by creating our own small-scale CR with funding from the NSF through grant DUE-2100114. This initiative is known as <strong>ACT: Attr<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">ACT</span>ing the Next Generation of Cybersecurity Workforce</strong><em>.</em></p>\r\n<p>ACT&rsquo;s CR is fully functional and can accommodate 20 concurrent students both in person and remotely. We have developed a series of exercises using the ACT&rsquo;s CR.</p>\r\n<p>2- We collaborated with three different companies (Genians, NinjaOne, and OCD Tech) that provided security services to develop hands-on exercises using their products. These exercises have been integrated into our networking and cybersecurity courses, enhancing students' practical learning experiences with industry-relevant tools.</p>\r\n<p>3- We hosted a variety of events - including the&nbsp;Cybersecurity Festival<em>,</em> industry presentations, competitions, and unplugged activities - featuring interactive security activities for both high school and Massbay students. The goal of these events was to foster a sense of community, which is important for student retention, while also connecting high school students with college students (peer mentors).</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, six MassBay Cybersecurity students played a key role in facilitating workshops and other events, enhancing both their leadership skills and the learning experience for participants.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impact</strong></p>\r\n<p>1- We initially partnered with one company and three high schools, but over the course of the project, our collaboration expanded to eight industry partners who contributed through&nbsp;internships, mentorship, and advisory board involvement. Additionally, we worked with&nbsp;twenty-one high schools, where students and teachers participated in workshops, presentations, and career events.</p>\r\n<p>2- We actively recruited students from twenty-one high schools, with focus on underrepresented students, especially women, encouraging them to study Cybersecurity. We leveraged our membership in Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS) to encourage young women to study Cybersecurity, which we believe will have a lasting impact on the society and the field.</p>\r\n<p>3- We offered workshops to 100 high school students from 14 high schools, where they completed the exercises, became familiar with the concept behind a CR and learned to practice offensive security exercises within a controlled environment.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;a- On average, our workshops attracted a diverse group of students: 22% of students self-identified as women/girls; 60% of students reported that their primary language was not English; 47% of students self-identified as part of a racial or ethnic minority; 26% of students received financial support.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">These figures highlight the&nbsp;ACT project's commitment to increasing access and opportunities&nbsp;for underrepresented groups in cybersecurity education.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; b- On average, student feedback demonstrated the impact of our workshops: 58% reported an&nbsp;increased knowledge&nbsp;of Cybersecurity; 51% expressed new or heightened<strong> </strong>interest in the field of Cybersecurity.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">These results underscore the effectiveness of our hands-on approach in&nbsp;building awareness and enthusiasm&nbsp;for cybersecurity among high school students.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">&nbsp;</span>4- We offered workshops and presentations to 7 teachers from 4 collaborative high schools, where they engaged in the same hands-on exercises as their students to build confidence in incorporating them into their curriculum. As a result, two teachers will be teaching Cybersecurity, further expanding the reach and impact of the ACT project.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;5- We have actively disseminated the&nbsp;ACT project through various conferences and events, sharing our experiences and outcomes with educators and industry professionals:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">ATE 2023</span>: Delivered an&nbsp;ACT project presentation and hosted an affinity session on embedding security in Biotech and manufacturing.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, a student involved in CR configuration&nbsp;presented a&nbsp;poster and a demo, showcasing their contributions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges Northeast Region (CCSCNE 2024)</span>: Conducted a 3 three-hour<strong> </strong>workshop where attendees connected remotely to ACT&rsquo;s CR and successfully completed all planned exercises.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">ATE 2024</span>: Presented the&nbsp;ACT project and conducted a lively Synergy session on industry involvement in our projects.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">ACM SIGCSE TS 2025</span>: We will be presenting the ACT project as one of selected NSF projects, NSF showcase in Feb 2025, further amplifying our impact on cybersecurity education.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">These dissemination efforts help expand the reach of the&nbsp;ACT project, fostering collaboration and encouraging adoption of cybersecurity education initiatives across institutions.</span><br /><br />6- We expanded connections with our industry partnerships, increasing internship opportunities&nbsp;for students. Additionally, we welcomed&nbsp;three new members to our Cybersecurity Advisory Board, further enhancing our ability to align curriculum and training with industry needs and workforce demands.</p>\r\n<p>7- Fifteen students successfully completed internships with Emerson Health, Bridgwater State University&rsquo;s SOC, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Staples to name a few.
