 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description\r\nThe Topical Conference on Microbes at Biomedical Interfaces will be held on November 16-17, 2020 and will bring together biomedical and chemical engineers as well as medical professionals.  Participants will explore interdisciplinary solutions to fundamental and applied problems to further understanding of the microbe/biomaterials interface. An increased understanding of the physicochemical interactions between microbes and biomaterials can tremendously aid in exploring novel and unconventional designs of biomaterials that would limit the formation of biofilm and the accumulation of pathogenic bacteria near medical implants. This topical conference will serve as a highly interactive and informative platform for catalyzing increased dialogue in this scientific area and will encourage active participation by early stage investigators from underrepresented groups as well as graduate and undergraduate researchers through student competitions and networking events.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nVery few forums exist that bring together biomedical and chemical engineers as well as medical professionals to discuss ways in which their disciplines can collaborate to find new solutions to fundamental and applied problems to further understanding of the microbe/biomaterials interface. This topical conference on Microbes at Biomedical Interfaces will serve as a highly interactive and informative platform for catalyzing increased dialogue in this scientific area.  There will be seven topical sessions, two of which are student and trainee centered competitions in the area of Microbiointerface Research. Scientific presentations will be given by a diverse group of researchers with opportunities to discuss the presented ideas afterwards. Organizers will encourage participation from women and underrepresented groups both as organizers, participants and speakers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
