 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to answer the question: how do \u201cmultimodal\u201d oscillatory forces affect the motion of particles and other objects?  Most prior research has focused on \u201cunimodal\u201d forces, which can be characterized by a single frequency (e.g., 1 Hz).  In contrast, a multimodal driving force involves the superposition of multiple frequencies (e.g., 1 Hz and 2 Hz).  Although multimodal oscillatory forces are more complicated, an object subject to a multimodal force may not move anywhere on average because the average of the force itself is zero.  Recent experimental work, however, has revealed that this interpretation is not necessarily correct.  Specifically, application of a dual-mode oscillatory electric field induces net motion of particles preferentially towards one electrode, but only if the two frequency modes are the ratio of odd and even numbers (e.g., 3 Hz and 2 Hz).  Further preliminary experiments revealed that net motion is also observed for solid objects placed on a flat surface made to vibrate laterally with dual frequency modes, again only if the modes are the ratio of odd and even numbers.  These similar observations in two very distinct systems suggest that certain types of multimodal forces can be exploited to precisely manipulate the motion of objects using oscillatory forces.  A series of experiments and modeling studies will be conducted on three prototype systems to uncover the mechanism that governs the net motion in response to a multimodal field.  Results from the project will be useful in a variety of technological applications, including particle manipulation for lab-on-a-chip devices, electrostatic dehydrators, and particle separations for granular materials.\r\n\r\nBased on the preliminary observations, this project tests the hypothesis that the net particle electrophoresis and the net vibratory drift both stem from symmetry breaking in the nonlinear driving terms of the respective governing momentum balances, provided the oscillatory driving force is \u201cnon-antiperiodic.\u201d High-speed video and particle imaging velocimetry will be used to precisely track the motion of objects in three different experimental systems: particle electrophoresis, charged droplet levitation, and vibrated solid objects. Specific experiments will be aimed at directly testing the hypotheses generated from the proposed mechanism, by systematically varying the ratio of imposed modes, the magnitude of the nonlinear resistances, and the overall amplitude of the driving force. The experimental observations will be tested against corresponding numerical models specific to each system, providing groundbreaking insight on the behavior of nonlinear systems with multimodal fields.  Because nonlinear effects are ubiquitous in nature, if corroborated the mechanism proposed here will provide fundamental and broadly applicable impact on how multimodal driving forces can be used to manipulate particle motion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The huge excitement and research activity regarding microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices over the past twenty years has focused almost exclusively on liquid-handling, but anybody who has worked in a chemical laboratory knows that there are many important dry-handling operations (such as adding a powder or salt to a liquid). We believe our vibratory approach provides the first facile technique for handling dry materials at chip scale. Second, we have demonstrated that we can separate millimetric dry granular materials based on small differences in frictional properties. We showed that we can quickly and gently separate salt and pepper; rubber and steel bits; pistachio nuts and shells; and healthy green coffee beans from defective beans. This result establishes a new class of dry materials handling based on textural properties, potentially allowing quick and efficient separation of materials with similar density and size but different textural properties. We anticipate this approach will be of great interest to many different industries, including electronic waste recycling, mining operations, and agricultural post-harvest processing.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/20/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: WilliamDRistenpart\n"
