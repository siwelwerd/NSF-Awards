 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2)\r\n\r\nDespite the rich scientific evidence of adaptations and their evolutionary basis, there are concerning public misconceptions about evolution, processes of natural selection, and adaptations in the biodiverse world.  Such misconceptions begin early. Younger elementary school children are often resistant to the idea that one \u201ckind\u201d of animal could descend from a completely different kind of animal, and they see features as having always existed. Other misconceptions lead to an inaccurate belief that changes in individual organisms acquired in a lifetime are passed directly on to offspring or that entire populations transform as a whole.   These cognitive biases and \"intuitive\u201d misunderstandings can persist into adulthood.  This Innovations in Development  project will counter  that narrative through an informal science project focusing on the blue whale  one of nature\u2019s most spectacular stories of adaptation.  It is a species that lives life at extremes: a long-distance migrator, a deep diver,  an extravagant eater,  the largest animal to ever exist. With its awe-inspiring size and rich mosaic of anatomical, physiological, and behavioral specializations, it serves as a bridge to an enriched understanding of universal concepts in elementary biology and  can begin to dispel the deeply rooted misconceptions. The project deliverables include  a giant screen film documenting the field work of research scientists studying the blue whales in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Mexico; multi-platform educational modules and programs that will build on the blue whale content from the film for use in science center programs and rural libraries;  and professional development webinars that will offer content utilization and presentation skills for ISE facilitators.  Project partners include California Science Center, STAR Library Education Network, HHMI Tangled Bank Studios and SK Films.  \r\n\r\nThe external evaluation studies will gather data from 20 participating rural libraries and 6 science museums. A formative evaluation of the film will be conducted in a giant screen theater setting with 75 families.  After viewing a fine-cut version of the film they will complete age-appropriate post-viewing surveys on the film\u2019s engagement, storytelling, content appeal and clarity, and learning value in communicating key science concepts.  An external  summative evaluation will include three studies. Study 1 will assess the implementation of the project at the 26 organizations, addressing the question: To what extent is the project implemented as envisioned in the libraries and science center settings? Baseline information will be collected, and later partners will complete post-grant surveys to report on their actual implementation of the project elements.  In addition, the  study will examine  outcomes relating to professional development.  Study 2 will be an  evaluation of the  film as experienced by 400 youth and parents in science centers and examining the question:  To what extent does experiencing the film engage youth and parents and affect their interest, curiosity, and knowledge of blue whales, adaptations, and the scientific process?   Study 3 will examine:   To what extent and how does experiencing an educational  module (virtual field trips, hands on activities, augmented reality) affect youth and parents\u2019 interest, curiosity, and knowledge of adaptations and scientific process?\r\n\r\nAs part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
