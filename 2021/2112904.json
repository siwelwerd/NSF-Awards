 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Telescope Array (TA) Observatory is the largest detector of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) in the northern hemisphere. An upgrade to the observatory (TAx4) is currently underway that will double the number of deployed surface detectors (SD) over an increased total instrumented area of approximately 1800 square-km.  An array of florescence detectors (FDs) overlooks this SD array, providing important additional information on the detected events. This award supports the cosmic ray physics group at the University of Utah for one year of running the TA Observatory complex.  The award supports the team, including managerial, engineering and technical staff, who have sole responsibility for facility maintenance, staffing observing shifts and handling data, and maintaining compliance with Bureau of Land Management land use regulations.  The observatory supports auxiliary and test experiments, including recently hosting a lightning mapping array. An extensive public education and outreach program coordinated through the ASPIRE project receives millions of online visits each year, and directed activities reach tens of thousands of teachers and students. \r\n\r\nRecent TA data analyses have identified a \u201chotspot\u201d of UHECRs above 57 EeV in the northern sky at 3.5 sigma significance.  The observatory has also seen indications of differences in the cosmic ray spectral shape when comparing events within the hotspot region to those outside, as well as an apparent declination dependence of the spectrum at the highest energies. The source of the hotspot, however, remains unknown. Inconsistencies between the measurements of TA and the Pierre Auger Observatory, the largest UHECR detector in the southern hemisphere, are also apparent at the highest energies, including in the studies of the width and shape of the Xmax distributions.  The additional data collected with the operation of the TAx4 upgrade, combined with the energy calibrations of the recently installed FDs, will greatly improve the sensitivity of the instrument toward resolving these important open questions in our understanding of the highest energy particles in the Universe.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nProject Outcome Report NSF-PHY-2112904\r\n\n\n20241222\r\n\n\nThe major goal of this project is the operation of the Telescope Array Observatory, its low energy extension (TALE), and its new high energy expansion (TAx4). The TAx4 SD expansion remained under construction and commissioning during this project. These three components of the project make measurements on cosmic rays arriving at the Earth with energies between ~3x10^15eV and 10^21eV.\r\n\n\nThe Telescope Array (with TALE and TAx4) consists of an array of ~890 scintillator detectors and three telescope stations that observe the sky over these detectors. Each scintillator detector is 3m^2 in area and they are presently sprinkled across ~750 square miles of desert in central Utah. These detectors sample the distribution of charged particles in the cosmic ray induced air showers when it reaches the surface of the Earth. By looking at the charge distribution and the arrival timing information of detectors hit by the air shower, we can determine the arrival direction of the initial cosmic ray and its original energy.\r\n\n\nWe have installed 60 fixed-direction telescopes observing the skies over the surface array from three sites on the periphery of the array. These telescopes observe the ultraviolet light generated when the shower of charged particles excites the atmospheric gases they are traversing. The telescopes observe the longitudinal development of the air shower as it passes through the atmosphere; first seeing the light grow with the number of particles and then decay as the energy per particle drops. From the shower footprint and light distribution as well as its timing information, we determine the arrival direction and energy of the incoming particle as well as information indicating its chemical composition.\r\n\n\nThe components of the Telescope Array measure the properties of cosmic rays over five orders of magnitude in energy. At the low energy end, our measurements overlap with those of IceTop and Kascade-Grande and almost reach down to the direct measurements of cosmic rays by experiments such as ISS-CREAM and AMS. At 3x10^15eV the sources of cosmic rays are of galactic origin and the cosmic rays are beginning a rigidity (magnetic confinement) cut-off. First protons and helium are leaking out of the galaxy. As the energy of the particles increases, particles of greater and greater charge begin to escape the magnetic confinement. Eventually, galactic iron is leaking out and extra-galactic protons are leaking into the galaxy. At the highest energies, the cosmic rays interact with the cosmic microwave background photons which limits their propagation distance.\r\n\n\nTo understand this picture, one must make measurements of the cosmic ray energy spectrum as well as the chemical composition of cosmic rays as a function of energy. Meanwhile, at the highest energies, the particles should experience the smallest magnetic bending and can be used to search for sources of cosmic rays.\r\nSurface Detector Operations\r\n\n\nThe TA experiment has been in routine observation mode since the spring of 2008. We operate all SD units, as close to full efficiency as possible. Especially during COVID-19, and its restrictions on travel, the Utah group had to try to maintain all SDs by itself. With detectors now spread over an area approaching the size of Rhode Island, there was some loss of efficiency. Post Covid, Japanese collaborators have returned and significant effort was expended to restore detectors that had accumulated issues such as weak batteries and GPS units which had been damaged by wildlife.\r\nFluorescence Detector Operations\r\n\n\nThe Utah group has continued to operate the main Middle Drum telescopes as well as the TALE and TAx4 telescopes. We have also operated the Black Rock TAx4 telescopes with their smaller shutters. Beginning during the COVID period we modified our practice from using two telescope operators at Middle Drum, to operate with one person on-site and a second person on Zoom as part of our safety protocol. The Utah group is also responsible for maintenance and repairs of the three large telescope shelters and 28 telescopes at Middle Drum as well as the shelter and 8 TA4 telescopes at Black Rock.\r\nFacility Management and Maintenance\r\n\n\nAs the host, the University of Utah group has the primary responsibility for the management of all TA facilities in Utah, including all three FD sites, the SD scintillator array, the Central Laser Facility (CLF), and the Watson Cosmic Ray Center (CRC) in Delta. The CRC serves both as a visitor center as well as the local workshop, storage, and staging area. TA facilities are located in remote areas without paved roads, power lines, or public wideband Internet service.\r\n\n\nThe group is also responsible for coordinating with a variety of Federal, State, Local, and University agencies as well as purchases, accounting, and billing for the observatory.\r\n\n\nResults and outreach are detailed in the Telescope Array Baseline Report.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JohnNMatthews\n"
