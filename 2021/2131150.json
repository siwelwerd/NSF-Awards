 "awd_abstract_narration": "In its 2019 report on the skilled technical workforce, the National Science Board noted that skilled technical workers represent 13% of the U.S. workforce aged 25 and older. Furthermore, these workers \u201ccontribute to all parts of the economy and the Science & Engineering enterprise\u201d by exercising \u201ccritical thinking, design, digital, math, and coding skills to work as auto mechanics, health care technicians, electricians, welders, computer systems analysts and administrators, and operators of \u2018smart\u2019 infrastructure.\u201d  This project will bring awareness to the educational pathways leading to work and career opportunities in the skilled technical workforce, bolstering connectedness among ATE students - and more generally all students in the two-year sector, educators, and industry stakeholders. A STEM-capable and competitive workforce leads to innovation, success in industry, new discoveries in research and development, and advancements in STEM achievements. This ultimately yields a more economically prosperous nation, renewed global competitiveness, and greater economic security and prosperity, all of which are goals of the ATE program.\r\n\r\nTechnician Navigator will produce an ATETV repository of authentic original content produced by current practicing technicians for future technicians that will include blogs, videos, audio materials, and forums. These materials will inform and engage students, families, and educators. Through virtual events and one-on-one sessions developed by faculty and industry representatives, technicians will guide prospective students through the college decision-making process, supporting them through enrollment. Creating contextual experiences to increase the quality, quantity, and diversity of a skilled technical workforce is at the heart of this project. Contextual experiences meet prospective students where they are instead of trying to attract their attention, and then use a series of connected experiences that incrementally guide them along their journey to enrolling in technician education programs at community and technical colleges. This will be a first-of-its-kind experiential resource designed to attract and recruit students into technician education programs and walk them through the process of enrolling in technician education programs. It is expected that Technician Navigator will serve the ATE community as a tested model for student recruitment with digital tools and resources for use in other ATE community outreach efforts. Content and contextual experiences will establish a community, connect people and programs, and generate excitement and interest through authentic materials and experiences. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
