 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). Large random structures are of central interest in mathematics and are used as models of various phenomena in physics, computer science, biology and many other branches of science.  Some specific examples include models for magnetism, gases, the spread of tumors, and noise in data sets. The goal of this project is to advance the study of many of these important models through new analytic techniques.  In addition to studying the specific models mentioned above, the project will build mathematical tools that can be used to study large random structures in general.  The project will provide training opportunities that will involve undergraduate and graduate students in research on some of the proposed projects.   \r\n\r\nThis project centers on analytic approaches to problems in discrete probability.  A central goal of the project is to create tools for demonstrating limit theorems, anti-concentration, and correlation decay for random variables based on analytic properties of generating and characteristic functions.  These methods contain immediate applications to models in combinatorics and mathematical physics such as the Ising model,  Gibbs point processes, and the hard core model.  The PI will use similar complex- and Fourier-analytic techniques to study random algebraic structures such as random matrices, random polynomials, random partitions, and random characters of the symmetric group.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe scientific portion of the project studied problems concerning random structures and limit theorems. There were many developments that resulted due to this award with some of the central developments concerning random matrices and random polynomials.\r\n\n\nAmong the most signifcant scientific work that resulted from this award was a pair of papers on random matrices that were joint with the PI and collaborators Campos, Jensen and Sahasrabudhe. The first of these works shows that given a random symmetric matrix, the probability that it fails to be invertible is exponentially small. New methods were developed in the theory of anti-concentration using a combination of techniques from Fourier analysis and high-dimensional probability. The second of these works by the same group showed an optimal-up-to-constants bound on the probability that a random symmetric matrix has an eigenvalue in a given window. Along the way, this work showed that the probability a random symmetric matrix has a repeated eigenvalue is exponentially small. This resolved questions of Vershynin and Nguyen-Tao-Vu.\r\n\n\nIn additional to the scientific output, the project allowed for mentorship with undergraduates at the University of Illinois Chicago. This amounted to a work concerning origami in the Bridges Conference 2023, an annual conference on mathematics and art. The PI also mentored and collaborated with graduate students, resulting in multiple published works. As a core part of the project, the PI organized a workshop on random matrices and random polynomials. In addition to disseminating the research in publications and preprints, the research was disseminated by the PI at conferences, seminars and summer schools both nationally and internationally.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/26/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MarcusMichelen\n"
