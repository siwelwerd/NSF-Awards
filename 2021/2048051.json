 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cells communicate between compartments to organize the reactions that support life. Synthetic cells also need to be able to communicate in order to exhibit useful traits, such as sensing other organisms and responding to external cues in specific ways. The cues might be small molecules, or they might be proteins, RNA, or DNA. This project will explore using bioinspired aqueous multiphase systems to create synthetic membraneless cells programmed to express and display messenger proteins, and communicate using protein signals. The project will also support training and education of Native American students.  A partnership with Navajo Technical University (NTU) will deliver a cross-institutional synthetic biology course and a funded UNM summer research internship for NTU students. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to create aqueous multiphase membrane free synthetic cell systems capable of chemical communication by exchange of an expressed protein messenger between sending and receiving synthetic cells. Testing of these concepts will take place in a cell-free protein synthesis system. Transcription and translation reagents will induce synthesis of a fluorescent messenger protein in sender cells and transferred to receiver cells. Success will provide a proof-of-principle that thermodynamic control mechanisms enabled by genetically encoded biomaterials can drive chemical communication between membraneless synthetic cells.  Design rules for control of signaling and biological activity within hierarchical, aqueous multiple phase systems will be developed. Membrane free synthetic cells could be used to produce biomolecules, deliver drugs, monitor the environment, or enhance tissue engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Cellular and Biochemical Engineering Program in ENG/CBET and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
