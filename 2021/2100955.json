 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project ensures the long-term preservation and security of the mammalian research collections housed at the University of Kansas (KU) Biodiversity Institute. The KU Biodiversity Institute\u2019s mammal collection is of international importance, ranked as the sixth largest in North America, and the third largest university holding in the world. This project replaces antiquated wooden specimen cabinets with updated stainless steel casing to rescue irreplaceable specimens from environmentally deficient conditions and preserve them in ideal, climate-controlled, pest-free housing in perpetuity. Safeguarding the KU Biodiversity Institute\u2019s mammal collection ensures the continued contribution of these resources to biodiversity science, formal undergraduate and graduate education, and public programming for K\u201312 students, teachers, and public audiences of the KU Biodiversity Institute\u2019s Natural History Museum. This project engages several undergraduate and graduate students in collections-based research projects and active curation. The physical specimens preserved at the Biodiversity Institute provide a critical foundation for research and education on DNA, climate change, evolution, conservation, and emerging pathogens, and are available for loan by researchers across the globe.\r\n\r\nThe KU Biodiversity Institute\u2019s mammal collection houses 279,936 dry specimens in 332 cabinets, 185 of which are antiquated and compromised wooden cabinets that date to the 1950s and 1960s, and whose joints, doors, and seals are inadequate for protecting dry specimens from pest infestations. Specimens will be vacuumed and frozen at -40\u00baC for 2 weeks to eliminate pests, then transferred to stainless steel cases for long-term preservation. During the transfer, data from specimen tags will be verified and digitally recorded in the Specify museum database, and served to the community through GBIF, iDigBio, BISON, and VertNet. As specimens are processed, phenotypic characters will be recorded, including the reproductive status or molting progress of each specimen, and these data will be used to test for shifts in mammalian life history events overtime. Students will collaborate with Exhibits Staff at the KU Biodiversity Institute to conceive and build a new public exhibit focused on the importance of scientific collections. The exhibit will highlight research stories that illustrate how critical collections are for solving problems of societal interest, including recognizing emerging pathogens and tracing the origins of invasive species.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This objective was achieved by replacing compromised wooden cabinet storage with modern steel cases to prevent specimen damage from pests and ensure quality, long-term specimen conservation. To that end, our team physically rehoused the 3rd-largest university-based mammal specimen collection in the US into new pest-proof cases to safe-guard specimens from environmental threats (e.g., heat, humidity), ensuring the utility of these specimen resources in research and education in perpetuity.</p>\n<p>During the physical transfer of specimens to new cases, students helped digitally recorded metadata on specimen tags, resulting in the addition of thousands of new trait datapoints to the <em>Specify </em>museum database, including physical measurements and reproductive data. Data hosted on <em>Specify </em>are publicly available and further served to the scientific community through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (gbif.org), iDigBio, and VertNet for use in biodiversity informatics research. Domestic and international loan output from the University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute&rsquo;s Division of Mammals has steadily increased throughout the duration of this project. Annually, the KUBI Mammal Collection provides the raw material (e.g., specimens) for ~30-50 peer-reviewed publications each year, such products are and will continue to be an outcome of this and other infrastructure awards. To date this project has produced 6 peer-reviewed publications, with further papers in development.</p>\n<p>This project developed a new public exhibit at the KUBI, that opened in July 2023. The new exhibit communicates the modern uses of museum collections in science, with specific examples from conservation genomics and emerging pathogen research. The exhibit is viewed by K-12 (&gt;10,000 annually through in-museum and in-gallery programs), university students (~30,000 enrolled annually), and regional audiences from across the Great Plains (&gt;50,000 annually). This project further trained 13 students in collections-based research and data digitization pipelines, including 8 students from underrepresented populations in STEM: three Ecology &amp; Evolution Biology graduate students (1 PhD, 2 Masters), 2 Museum Studies graduate students, 1 US veteran post-baccalaureate scholar, and seven undergraduate students, including 1 undergraduate in KU&rsquo;s Emerging Scholar Program. Students&rsquo; received career-relevant training in collections management, specimen preparation, data digitization, and collection-based research.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 09/05/2024<br>\nModified by: Jocelyn&nbsp;P&nbsp;Colella</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2100955/2100955_10756688_1725571524314_holistic_specimen--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2100955/2100955_10756688_1725571524314_holistic_specimen--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Holistic specimen\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2100955/2100955_10756688_1725571524314_holistic_specimen--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Holistic specimen\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A series of interactive drawers in the new public exhibit at the KUBI teach visitors about what modern museum collections look like.
