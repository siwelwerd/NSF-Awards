 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to determine how concentrated surfactant-based solutions are affected by common chemical additives and manufacturing processes. Concentrated surfactant solutions are used to formulate detergent-based products for cleaning, laundry, and other personal care. A better understanding of the solution\u2019s structure-property-processing relationships will enable industry to more efficiently manufacture concentrated solutions to achieve desired properties and performance while also meeting sustainability goals such as reducing water from formulated liquids. Thus, the new knowledge resulting from this project will ultimately lead to reduced economic and environmental costs associated with detergent-based products as well as corresponding gains in important public health measures related to global hygiene. This project is a collaboration between faculty and students at Purdue University and technical staff at The Procter and Gamble Company (P&G), providing the Purdue graduate and undergraduate students with valuable industrial experiences and professional development opportunities. In addition to the research activities, lab modules and lecture demos will be created in collaboration with P&G to teach the fundamentals of phase diagrams to engineering students through an engaging, hands-on approach coupling physical models of surfactant solutions with online computational tools.\r\n \r\nModel lamellar-structured surfactant solutions containing different additives will be investigated through a series of rheophysical, scattering, and birefringence experiments coupled with fluid dynamic modeling and pilot-scale processing studies.  The results will hep evaluate the impact of common formulation additives and processing routes on the multiscale structures and properties of surfactant solutions, including surfactant bilayer spacing, thickness, and bending moduli.  In addition to studying conventional dodecyl sulfate surfactants, the research team will also investigate a class of microbial biosurfactants, which are more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Project deliverables include: (1) experimentally validated constitutive models that connect macroscale dynamics of concentrated lamellar-structured surfactant solutions with nano- and micro-scale characteristics of surfactant bilayers; and (2) predictive processing maps to ultimately create concentrated surfactant solutions at scale with a desired microstructure and end-use performance. Project outcomes are expected to be relevant to a variety of areas beyond cleaning and personal care, including environmental remediation, surfactant manufacturing, and lipid-based vaccine development. This project will build upon fundamental experimental studies that were performed in the early 1990s on the flow behavior of liquid crystalline surfactant fluids and the impact of shear on the fluid\u2019s microstructure as well as recent work that used in situ rheophysical measurements to connect power-law shear thinning rheology with the surprising occurrence of macroscale wall slip and plug flow in concentrated surfactant solutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
