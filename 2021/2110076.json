The complexity of today\u2019s supply chain makes it difficult to optimize micro-logistics processes, such as quality control, inventory tracking, re-stocking, traceability, deadline projections, and indoor transport. The commercialization of a micro-logistics Internet of Things (IoT) may bridge the physical with the digital world, providing significant visibility and enhanced analytics, potentially saving billions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of technology for high-precision, robust, and real-time positioning. The proposed technology may transform billions of already-deployed, batteryless Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFIDs) tags into powerful micro-location sensors. The proposed technology relies on a wireless excitation protocol combined with innovations in signal processing, super-resolution algorithms, and sensor network architecture. It has been tested in practical real-world environments, demonstrating the ability to achieve centimeter-scale positioning in challenging indoor environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
