 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The ability to generate a high internal body temperature independent of environmental temperature, has independently evolved twice in vertebrate animals, in mammals and in birds. However, there is a high cost (in terms of energy) to maintaining a high body temperature. This project focuses on understanding why there is increased body temperatures in modern mammals. To answer this question, the PI will use the tenrec as a model system. Tenrecs are mammals from Madagascar with a body temperature more variable than any other known mammal, and are an excellent model for understanding the advantages of having a warmer body temperature. More specifically this project will focus on how body temperature influences digestion, which is connected to energy generation. To broaden participation, the fellow will set up two independent outreach events at the University of Nevada Las Vegas aimed at increasing minority engagement within the Department of Life Sciences.\r\n\r\nTenrecs have the remarkable ability to partially disconnect body temperature and metabolism. For instance, when maintained at 12\u00b0C, the body temperature of active tenrecs can range from ~13 to 32\u00b0C but resting metabolism of active tenrecs at 12\u00b0C may vary by 25-fold and is only partially dependent on body temperature. The fellow will exploit a unique mammalian system in order to understand how body temperature influences the nutrient extraction from food. This model will directly test the hypothesis that warmer body temperatures allow for greater nutrient extraction from foods. To test this nutrient extraction model for the evolution of endothermy (increased body temperature), an integrative approach will be used. Utilizing whole animal, ex vivo, and in vitro 3D cell culture approaches to develop a multi-level approach the exploits whole animal, organ, and even cellular level investigation. Fewer than 2% of all post-docs in STEM fields are Black/African American, which is an over 6-fold underrepresentation of the population as a whole. Diversity within biological sciences will not increase unless underrepresented individuals are elevated thus, becoming an example of opportunities within this field. To broaden participation, the fellow will establish outreach events at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, leveraging the LSAMP program there.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
