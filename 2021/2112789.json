 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research activities of Professor Joshua Berger at Colorado State University.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of matter we have observed in the Universe is dark and has so far only been seen by its gravitational pull on visible particles. Detecting and determining the nature of dark matter are among the highest priority goals of particle physics in the coming years.  While dedicated experiments have been built to look for some dark matter candidates, recent efforts have demonstrated that even experiments not expressly built to look for dark matter can make important contributions to the hunt for these elusive particles.  The bulk of Professor Berger\u2019s research aims to develop models and predictions of dark matter that can be seen at experiments designed to study other phenomena such as neutrinos and atoms, creating valuable synergy with other areas of physics.  Research into the nature of dark matter thus contributes to the national interest by promoting progress in answering fundamental scientific questions as to the nature of the universe and its basic building blocks.  This project will also have significant broader impacts. Professor Berger plans to train students and post-doctoral scientists in advanced physics research methods, as well as in state-of-the-art computing techniques. He will also present the results of his research in both public and scientific presentations, and incorporate aspects of his research in the curricula for courses he teaches.\r\n\r\nIn technical terms, this research encompasses searches for dark sector particles at current and future neutrino and atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics experiments.  This research also involves studying alternate cosmological histories to develop new mechanisms for baryogenesis. Ongoing and upcoming neutrino experiments such as the accelerator-based Short Baseline Neutrino (SBN) experiments and Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will be able to detect dark matter and long-lived dark states produced in collisions of their very intense proton beams with a target. Large volume experiments such as the DUNE far detector can also be sensitive to astrophysical dark matter interacting in the detector. Professor Berger will explore hidden sector models such as Higgs Portal models leading to dark sector particles produced in the beams at these experiments. He will further explore dark matter models such as boosted dark matter and macroscopic dark matter which lead to dark matter from astrophysical sources interacting in neutrino detectors. He will develop new simulation tools needed to investigate these models and propose new search strategies to ensure that interesting signals are not missed. His work will also encompass a collaboration with an AMO experimentalist, Professor Samuel Brewer at Colorado State University, to develop searches for dark matter in high-precision atomic measurements performed in Professor Brewer\u2019s lab.  Finally, he will study the properties of a possible phase of the early universe in which the weak force becomes strongly coupled, leading to the possibility of a new mechanism for baryogenesis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe goal of this project was to examine new approaches to modeling and searching for physics that extends the Standard Model of particle physics. While the Standard Model has been extremely succesful at describing laboratory results in particle physics, it is known to be missing an explanation for several phenomena such as an explanation for dark matter and the excess abundance of matter over anti-matter in the universe. With the models and techniques studied in this project, my team and I have advanced our prospects for arriving at an explanation for these phenomena. This work interplays with new and developing laboratory projects. In one part of this project, we have demonstrated the ability of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), based at Fermilab near Chicago and at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota, to elucidate the nature of dark matter and related phenomena. This work involved and continues to evolve several models of interest, such as a new model in which dark matter gets pulled toward the Earth by a new force that leads to a dark matter rain that would lead to striking signals at the DUNE far detector in South Dakota. Another paper that was published during this award period studied a model in which the dark matter could, very rarely, induce the decay of protons, leading to a signal that differs in the details to the more commonly studied hypothetical spontaneous decay of protons. In another part of this project, we published new results demonstrating how the nascent study of gravitational waves, particularly residual gravitational waves produced during the first second of the universe could shed light on exotic physics that may arise during this mysterious era in the universe's history. Other aspects of this work have made significant progress of the last year and are on schedule to be completed and published during the first period of my new award.\r\n\n\nAll of the work performed during this award period involved collaboration with and training of junior scientists, including several graduate students both at my home institution of Colorado State University and elsewhere. The techniquest that are used in my group have been demonstrated to have significant use both in academic study of physics and in technical jobs outside of academia. Training in critical thinking, problem solving, mathematics, and computation are all essential aspects of the work performed under this award that have been emphasized during this award period. Students in my research group funded under this awarrd have had opportunities to present their work at international conferences, further developing their technical communication skills and disseminating the results of this project to the broader scientific community. I anticipate that this work will influence the data analysis and deisgn of future experiments, partticularly in neutrino physics and in gravitational wave astronomy. Finally, the work on induced proton decay that was published during this award period led to some attention from the scientific press, with an article posted on the widely-read phys.org website as well as in the local Colorado State University news bulletin.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JoshuaBerger\n"
