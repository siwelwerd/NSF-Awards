 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Karim-Aly Kassam at Cornell University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating knowledge co-production processes and how they enable or constrain social learning, with the aim of contributing to more empirically-informed theories of collaborative environmental stewardship. As global environmental change continues to accelerate and intensify, science and society are turning to collaborative environmental management to facilitate transitions to sustainability. Collaborative approaches such as knowledge co-production bring together diverse actors from different sectors of society to work towards solutions for social-ecological problems. Knowledge co-production processes have been shown to facilitate social learning, foster adaptive capacity, and support collective action outcomes by building trust and enabling communication among the diverse members of a management team.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this research is to integrate local, Indigenous, and scientific knowledge to co-create a holistic understanding of past and future environmental change. The case study is located in and around a protected area that is experiencing rapid, large scale change from the construction of a dam. Using a combination of sophisticated remote sensing analyses and ethnographic inquiry, this work will examine (1) how different groups think about and value the protected area (e.g., governmental, scientific, Indigenous groups), (2) what anticipatory strategies emerge for addressing the changes occurring there, and (3) how participants experience social learning throughout the knowledge co-production process.  This research will generate new understanding of how different socio-cultural groups conceptualize and value their environment, which can help us understand critical anthropogenic drivers of environmental change in this system and around the world. Second, we will compare and contrast local narratives of change with measurements derived from remote sensing analyses, revealing areas of complementary understanding as well as critical gaps between scientific and Indigenous knowledge. Third, we will employ cognitive modeling exercises in conjunction with participatory scenario planning to co-generate strategies for anticipating and responding to future environmental change \u2013 thus refining these methods for use in other systems. Finally, this project will advance our ability to conceptualize and measure social learning, for which methods are urgently needed. Workshops with community members, an open-access educational case study on transdisciplinary science, a project report, and at least two peer-reviewed journal articles will contribute to achieving these objectives.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Collaborative approaches such as knowledge co-production bring together diverse actors to work towards solutions for social-ecological problems. This project brought together local and scientific knowledge to co-create a holistic understanding of environmental change in and around a protected area in southeastern Senegal that is experiencing rapid, large-scale change from the construction of a dam. This project was transdisciplinary, seeking to advance both scientific and societal objectives.</p>\n<p>First, PI Steger completed a literature review of ethnobotanical approaches to understanding the savanna in Senegal and West Africa more broadly, which guided the development of interview protocols and data collection instruments for fieldwork. This in turn led to a systematic review of the most valuable roof thatch species used worldwide, as thatch emerged as a key non-timber use of savannas. PI Steger analyzed over 200 peer-reviewed journal articles and synthesized the findings in a manuscript, which is currently under review at World Development Sustainability. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>PI Steger then conducted 11 weeks of fieldwork in Senegal to answer the first research question regarding how diverse actors understand the causes and consequences of environmental change in the region. They interviewed 46 individuals in Pulaar and French, representing 38 local resource users and 8 government representatives. PI Steger formed new partnerships with Senegalese and American scientists working on similar issues, and together they co-authored a manuscript describing local perceptions of environmental change and the relative socio-cultural importance of different savanna plant species impacted by this change, and which proposes a set of recommendations for adaptive co-management of Senegalese savanna forests. Their results emphasize that because site-specific conditions exert such strong control on vegetation productivity and structure in these forests, local-scale studies like this one are needed to understand how livelihoods and cultural values intersect with biophysical changes.</p>\n<p>PI Steger and Professor Kassam are preparing another publication from this fieldwork, which describes the role of djinn (spirits) in forest conservation in Senegal. This emergent theme from our fieldwork engages with pre-Islamic and Islamic beliefs in the power of djinn to influence human conservation behavior by eliciting emotions such as fear and empathy. This work holds potential to shed light on a pervasive yet under-explored conservation ethic in West Africa.</p>\n<p>PI Steger then conducted a remote sensing analysis of CHIRPS and Landsat imagery to understand past precipitation and vegetation change in the area. They processed CHIRPS imagery using the Climate Engine Application, and Landsat data using the Noise Insensitive Trajectory Algorithm. They then used statistical tests such as the Mann-Kendall and ANOVA to test for differences in changing precipitation and vegetation patterns across the different protected forests within the study area. PI Steger and Professor Kassam, in collaboration with Samba Kande, wrote a technical report that integrates these remote sensing results with ethnographic observations from the fieldwork. The technical report is written for a lay audience. It is being translated into French, printed, and presented to both government officials and research participants in Senegal, with oral explanations given in Pulaar as needed.</p>\n<p>PI Steger received excellent professional development training through participation in Professor Kassam?s research group, including biweekly research meetings, attending international conferences and mentoring Master?s students. PI Steger also co-organized a writing group of postdoctoral researchers in human-environment geography at Cornell, which transformed into career strategy and job applicant support ?with &nbsp;five of seven postdocs finding new positions in both academia and the federal government. This included PI Steger, who ended this fellowship nine months early to pursue a position with the International Technical Assistance Program in the Department of the Interior.</p>\n<p>This project laid the foundation for future collaborative, transdisciplinary research in and around the Western Region of Niokolo-Koba National Park by establishing a diverse research team composed of academics, farmers, NGO researchers, local administrators, and environmental officers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/31/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Cara&nbsp;E&nbsp;Steger</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2104611/2104611_10763987_1680269726820_GraphicalAb_v2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2104611/2104611_10763987_1680269726820_GraphicalAb_v2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Graphical Abstract\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2104611/2104611_10763987_1680269726820_GraphicalAb_v2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Graphical Abstract\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Graphical abstract from systematic review of valuable roof thatch species around the world.
