 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate change is a complex global problem that demands collaborative engagement. While students in higher education have long participated in climate action and some have attended the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) annual Conference of the Parties (COP) to learn about global climate negotiations, there has yet to be a coordinated effort to bring those students together to learn from each other and share their experiences; nor has there been a concerted effort to train students in how to interact directly with COP participants. By creating a multicultural and multi-institutional opportunity for students, the Pre-COP conference will become a launching pad for climate action and innovations led by youth at their home campuses, as well as on the global stage.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cRoad to Glasgow Pre-COP Student Conference\u201d (hereafter \u201cPre-COP\u201d) will take place in Derby, United Kingdom, as well as virtually, October 28-30, 2021, immediately preceding COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland. The PIs leading this effort are from the YEAH Network, a transdisciplinary, multi-institutional, international Research Coordination Network for Undergraduate Biology Education that focuses on providing real world experience on environmental negotiations and policy for students in science and sustainability majors. The Pre-COP will prepare students in science and sustainability related disciplines to participate actively in, and contribute to, the COP26. First, students will be introduced to the culture and structure of international environmental negotiations and the COP processes. Second, interdisciplinary student teams will generate action plans within broad thematic topics with the goal of enhancing synergies between youth in higher education and international policy frameworks. Third, students will be guided to present these ideas at the COP26 via press conferences and presentations at side events (e.g., the U.S. country pavilion). Finally, participants will share the ideas generated at the Pre-COP as well as their firsthand experience at COP26 with their home campuses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Students met online and/or in person with faculty from nine colleges and universities. Some students traveled to the international United Nations climate meetings, known as \"Conference of the Parties\" (COP) in Egypt (COP27, 2022) and United Arab Emirates (COP28, 2023). At these meetings they presented an art exhibit, led panel discussions, and met with other students and professionals from around the world.<br /><br />As the climate changes, the next generation of graduates will have to respond to problems such as heat stress, rising sea levels, and more severe storms and wildfires. Their careers will be impacted by those threats and by policies to reduce risk. Climate change has global causes, impacts, and solutions. Our students benefit from meeting people who are working on all parts of this problem.<br /><br />The project helped students participate in two annual meetings of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. At these meetings countries work together to resolve to global threat of climate change through negotiations. At the same time, countries and non-profit organizations (NGOs) showcase their climate work and host discussions.<br /><br />For this project, our first major activity was the art exhibit \"Voices and Visions: The Art and Science of Climate Action,\" displayed on a prominent wall of the U.S. Center for the entire two weeks of COP27 (Nov 6-18, 2022). Mentors met with the students intensively for eight weeks leading up to COP to produced the show. Students designed a layout, solicited and selected artwork, obtained copyright releases, hung the artwork, and prepared a program guide, available online. A series of 27 short videos, produced with the invaluable assistance of collaborator Carrie Lederer (Carrier Pidgeon Productions), accompanied, 2022 the art. Twenty-five students from seven institutions were involved. Students who were able to travel to COP27 served as guides, greeting visitors and discussing the artwork. Visitors included U.S. Congresspeople, officials from agencies such as NASA and Department of Energy, and people from many countries.<br /><br />Our second project activity was also at COP27; students organized and presented a 1-hour panel on \"Educating the Next Generation of Climate Leaders,\" on November 10. The panel featured students Rose Daily (Michigan Tech), Daniel Briggs (CSU), Daniel Dominguez (CSU), and Ellen Stofan (Smithsonian Institution), Brandon Jones (NSF), and Leah Dundon (Vanderbilt). The session was well received and well attended (and not only because it immediately preceded a panel of U.S. Senators!). A video of the panel is posted on the State Department youtube channel. <br /><br />Our third, activity was a 2-day pre-COP workshop in October, 2023, before COP28. This two-day conference &ndash; the Road to COP &ndash; was aimed at educating and empowering young leaders in climate policy and action. It was held at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. in October 2023. Participants were undergraduate and graduate students from ten colleges and universities. The Smithsonian, through its educational partnerships, facilitated the inclusion of 12 local high school students, which provided mentoring opportunities for the college/graduate students.<br /><br />The conference activities introduced students to climate-related career paths and to the role of the United States in international negotiations. <br />On the first day participants heard from Dr. Allison Crimmins, the Director of the National Climate Assessment, and Dr. Phil Levine, Director of the new National Nature Assessment. Sessions on effective climate outreach and education techniques were led by the Smithsonian Science Education Center. <br /><br />In the afternoon, students met Marcella Kim and Nathan Cogswell, who worked with the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. negotiating team at COP.&nbsp; In this session they learned about international climate negotiations and career pathways in climate policy. Katherine Blanchard from the Smithsonian Science Education Center discussed climate literacy and communication. All these presentations were highly engaging and were followed by enthusiastic discussions.<br /><br />In the afternoon, interactive sessions encouraged networking and collaboration, culminating in a group activity where students developed action plans aligned with climate priorities for the upcoming COP28 conference.<br /><br />On the last day of the event, students were organized into working groups based on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Each group developed a problem statement related to real-world climate issues in their communities and presented proposed policy goals, solutions, and climate communication strategies. In the afternoon teams explored Smithsonian exhibits in several of the museums. Students were challenged to consider the SDGs and climate as they viewed the exhibits. At the end of the workshop, students reflected on ways to integrate their learnings into future climate initiatives and their own career pathways. <br /><br />Throughout the workshop, students enhanced their understanding of climate change and impacts.
