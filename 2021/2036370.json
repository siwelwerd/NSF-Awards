 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a new rapidly dry-sanitizing technology for disposable single-use personal protective equipment (PPE) and other articles in a manner that preserves material integrity and function to enable multiuse during pandemic and post-pandemic times. It will promote energy and water conservation, and reduce plastic waste significantly. This ozone-based sanitization technology will benefit all frontline workers regularly exposed to infectious diseases such as COVID-19. The need for rapid sterilization technology is likely to grow to mitigate social distancing configurations. Schools, daycare centers, health and fitness facilities, factories, and airports will need to implement sterilization protocols. With this technology, clothes, face shields and masks, phones, smart devices, and all manner of personal articles can be easily sanitized in less than ten minutes. The market for small industrial-scale waterless appliances with the capacity to offer on-demand sterilization may also expand rapidly. While ozone is used in a wide range of sterilization technologies, there is currently no consumer-friendly dry washing machine.  Thus, this project may also support development of an eco-friendly and effective laundry solution. Together, the sanitization and safety tasks will advance this technology as a viable waterless sanitization device, with the distinct advantage of lower cost, compact size, operational ease, and accessibility.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project advances translation of a low-cost, rapidly deployable gas-based field sanitizer that does not require water, solvents, or detergents. To combat infectious viruses and odor-causing bacteria, this technology must meet aggressive benchmarks set by federal regulatory agencies for ozone emissions while achieving the highest bioburden reduction levels short of an autoclave. This project will optimize the ozone dose (ppm and time of exposure) required for viral inactivation and testing mask fit and filtration efficiency after repeated exposure to high ozone concentrations. The device will also incorporate new containment and neutralization technologies to meet environmental safety requirements. The device performance will be characterized by monitoring the exhaust for residual ozone during and after operation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
