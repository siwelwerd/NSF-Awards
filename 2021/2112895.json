 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to valuable fuels.  This technology plays a role in the carbon capture and utilization process that has the potential to significantly reduce CO2 emissions. Production of carbon neutral fuels and chemicals from CO2 using renewable electricity is a commercially viable pathway to offset the carbon footprint. The proposed efficient solution supports profitable production of carbon neutral fuels and chemicals. When scaled, this technology may impact a wide spectrum of areas that currently depend on fuels and chemicals produced using traditional methods ranging from aviation fuels to pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project focuses on carbon utilization and production of clean fuels and chemicals to help mitigate climate change. The proposed method employs electrochemical conversion of CO2 using renewable electricity and water, generation of synthesis gas (syngas), and further conversion of syngas in the Fischer-Tropsch process to produce a wide variety of chemicals. This technology represents a new class of catalysts with high energy efficiency and selectivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
