 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atomic, Molecular and Optical (AMO) physics is an enabling science that has contributed to some of the most significant scientific and technical advances of the last century. While the first quantum revolution led to an expanded understanding of the structure of atoms and molecules -- the elementary building blocks of matter -- with applications in navigation, medicine, computing, and communication in use across the industry, society and economy, a new quantum revolution is fully upon us.  The second quantum revolution is powered by remarkable technological advances in precision and control of interactions between atomic species, and manipulation and study of the coherent properties of light and matter. Large-scale programmable quantum systems with atoms and ions are now routinely realized. Quantum simulators, with atoms trapped over macroscopic distances in optical tweezers and strongly coupled with Rydberg excitations, promise to allow scaling up of fast quantum gates. Advances in precision measurement, clocks and sensing using atoms, molecules, and artificial atoms now impact our understanding of the most fundamental aspects of quantum physics and cosmology. A center of excellence in AMO theory will serve as the integrator of activities in helping to lead this revolution in quantum technologies. The Institute for Theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics (ITAMP) hub will serve a broad community of physicists in the U.S.\r\n\r\nITAMP at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) in Cambridge, MA will strive to be an incubator facility for theoretical AMO physics by providing resources and access to the rich AMO-related ecosystem of excellence in Cambridge, to create a collaborative environment for visiting fellows and for the training and mentoring of junior fellows, to broadly advocate for the field, and to lead in forefront research in AMO physics and outreach efforts to the community. ITAMP will hold and host targeted meetings in which large groups of practitioners will gather in critical mass to mount coordinated attacks on topical challenges in AMO physics and find novel solutions to these problems. Postdoctoral fellows and students will benefit from proximity to these recognized figures in theoretical and experimental AMO science. Visiting fellows, housed in an enriching office environment, will interact with the postdoctoral and scientific fellows in ways not otherwise possible. Winter Graduate Schools will be scheduled to train students keen on learning fundamental and advanced topics in AMO physics. As part of its programmatic mission, the Institute will recruit faculty/student teams from minority-serving colleges as summer Fellows.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
