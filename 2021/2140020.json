 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact / commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to significantly increase the strength of 3-dimentional (3D) printed parts, to enable flexible fabrication of optimized composite structures, and to reduce material consumption and overall production cost of the parts. These impacts are enabled by a novel design optimization algorithm that simultaneously optimizes part geometry and 3D printing toolpath.  Leveraging industrial robots as the 3D printing platform, the algorithm creates printing toolpaths along multiple build axes, which enables the alignment of composite materials along a part's predicted principal loads. The technology offers potential customers an opportunity to get additional value from the materials they are already using in production.  The first benefit is in the context of the amount of material used and the second, in final part performance through increased mechanical properties relative to the end-use application while also reducing weight. These improvements will be of value to industries interested in creating high-performance composite parts where minimizing part mass.  The products may be useful in achieving key design objective for aerospace, automotive, prosthetics, and athletic equipment.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project develops a novel additive manufacturing technology and computational design algorithm that optimizes material deposition to dramatically increase the strength of 3D printed composite parts. The technology directly addresses the limitations of existing 3D printing technologies where the repetitive, stacked layer interfaces result in a part with inherent weaknesses aligned with the build direction. This project's technology focus combines multi-axis robotics, additive manufacturing, and topology optimization to enable concurrent optimization of part topology and printing toolpath such that the printed material is strategically aligned within the part to maximize performance. The algorithm optimizes material distribution and orientation relative to the part's end-use application, propagates deposition paths aligned to those orientations, and orders the deposition paths to enable collision-free deposition. The combination of multi-axis robotics and the optimized printing toolpath enables true 3D material deposition that removes the inter- and intra-layer bonds from the load paths acting on the structure, which enables direct additive manufacturing of end-use, load-bearing, composite structures. The topology and multi-axis toolpath optimization workflow has resulted in printed parts with significant improvement in strength as compared to parts fabricated using conventional 3-axis 3D printing techniques.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Ideally, the fiber (e.g., carbon or glass) would be aligned to the load paths acting on the part to maximize mechanical performance, but existing composites manufacturing processes heavily limit design flexibility and material alignment. Ultimately, structures have to be produced with additional mass that detracts from performance. 3D printing (or additive manufacturing; AM) technologies offer this necessary design flexibility but are classically restricted from the fabrication of load-bearing parts due to poor mechanical properties. To address this perceived market gap, the team created an automated design workflow and manufacturing platform (supported by an industrial robotic arm) that can align composite fiber to 3D load paths. In theory, this technology bridges the gap between the geometric flexibility inherent to AM processes and the mechanical properties necessary in these high-valued industries to enable fabrication of end-use, load-bearing components with significantly reduced mass relative to conventional composites manufacturing processes.</p>\n<p>Joined by an industrial advisor from a small business focused on metal AM, the team attended the I-Corps program as part of the 2021 Winter cohort in New York City, NY. The team conducted a total of 101 customer discovery interviews during the course (28 in-person, 56 via video-call, and 17 via telephone). The predominant focus was placed on the aerospace industry for its (1) higher cost point per-pound of composite and (2) lower part throughput (as compared to, for instance, the automotive industry). The team interviewed industry professionals across the aerospace supply chain including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), manufacturing suppliers, aerospace startups, and composite material suppliers to evaluate the ecosystem around manufacturing technology adoption. Interviews were also conducted with AM machine, service, and material suppliers to identify established AM technology transfer techniques.</p>\n<p>The interviews provided the team with significant insights into the core needs of the aerospace manufacturing industry. While the significant hesitancy towards AM from a qualification/certification standpoint was not surprising, the methodologies for designing and analyzing composites were: although composites are highly anisotropic (directional mechanical properties), structures and layup schedules were designed to produce a relatively isotropic (uniform) performance, making them easier to model, analyze, and qualify. From our perspective, this so-called \"black aluminum\" approach is suboptimal, and we specifically created our design and manufacturing technology to beneficially leverage material anisotropy for mechanical performance benefits. Through the interview process, it became clear that there were two major commercialization hurdles we would be faced with: trust in (1) AM-produced load-bearing structures and (2) a design-for-anisotropy method for creating composite structures. Despite these major hurdles, many interviewees (unprompted) specifically outlined the value propositions and key technical advancements we were expecting to offer (e.g., robotic AM and non-layer-wise material deposition) as desirable for their industry. In conjunction, this feedback led to a critical pivot for the team; rather than immediately offering end-use composite parts, we began to explore an opportunity to offer case study demonstrations, performed collaboratively with R&amp;D engineers at major aerospace organizations to demonstrate, develop, and validate our technology further. This seemed to align with the state of the industry - R&amp;D engineers have case study parts they want to prove out using new technologies for presentation to their project managers before larger investments can be made.</p>\n<p>However, in addition to the commercialization hurdles, the lack of structurally performant, printable composites was also identified as a technical hurdle.
