 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to document the views of a unique set of researches all of whom aspire to lead large-scale science and engineering research projects through stakeholder mapping survey methods. It will also develop exploratory methodology to deliver serial virtual workshop sessions at scale that prepare researchers to conceptualize, plan, and execute high impact large projects. To accommodate the virtual format, the project serialized delivery over 7 weeks and revised the pedagogy so that each session could be an integrated package of pre-recorded video, live keynote speakers, formal presentation, short exercises completed in small break-out groups, and interactive surveys for participant feedback. This proposal will allow for engaging professionals who can seamlessly deliver these materials in real time to over 1,000 simultaneous participants and identify which elements are most effective. Stakeholder mapping surveys will be used both to provide reflective input to the participants and to advance the science of science and engineering and better understand the interests and capabilities of researchers who aspire to lead large-scale science and engineering projects.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will improve investigator understanding and capability for advancing the scientific, economic, workforce, and innovation impacts of their research. It will expand national capacity to lead large-scale science and engineering research projects.  It will also support long-term hosting of the workshop series for on-going community reuse.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
