 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michael Alves is awarded a FY21 Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research (NSF MPS-Ascend) Fellowship to conduct a program of research and activities related to broadening participation by groups underrepresented in Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley.  The project being performed by Michael Alves, entitled Environmental Organic Chemistry of Indoor Gases and Surface Films, is to be conducted under the guidance of mentoring scientist Allen H. Goldstein.  In addition to support from the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, this project is supported by the Atmospheric Chemistry Program of the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences. \r\n\r\nSurfaces play a significant role in chemical reactions occurring on indoor air chemistry. Since Americans spend significant amounts of time indoors, it is important to understand what chemical reactions can occur in these spaces. Dr. Alves will carry out experiments in a newly built indoor controlled research facility that mimic a real residence. This will be followed by laboratory experiments to isolate the role of common indoor surfaces on the multiphase chemistry of gases and adsorbed species. Dr. Alves will support students with underrepresented minority backgrounds through mentoring and identifying paid research opportunities. He will also collaborate on a program to develop indoor-relevant chemistry demonstrations for K-12 students in local communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
