 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate how people respond to actual and anticipated discrimination. Literature on discrimination in economics has primarily focused on evaluating whether and how employers discriminate against employees. Substantially less research has investigated how employees respond to discrimination, and whether they may actively avoid situations in which they anticipate being discriminated against. These responses may be important drivers of the underrepresentation of women in male-dominated high paying jobs. In the first set of projects, the authors will conduct a series of laboratory experiments in which subjects face choices over working in different environments. These environments differ based on whether they have rules that discriminate against certain groups of subjects. By eliciting subjects\u2019 preferences over these environments, the researchers will evaluate whether subjects are willing to give up money to avoid facing discrimination. In the second set of projects, the researchers will investigate people\u2019s beliefs about potential signals of discrimination in the labor market and how these beliefs affect their choices. Together, these projects will provide insight into the role that beliefs about and responses to discrimination may play in the persistence of wage gaps in the labor market.\r\n\r\nIn this project, the researchers will investigate the role that discrimination anticipation plays in the labor market, and how providing information about signals of discrimination affects workers' choices and beliefs. The emphasis for much of the economics literature on discrimination has been placed on the role of the employer. Theoretical papers have shown that supply-side (employee) perceptions of discrimination may play a crucial role in the persistence and exacerbation of group-level wage gaps (Coate and Loury, 1993; Lang et al, 2005). Yet, empirical research on the relevance and role of discrimination anticipation among employees is limited. In this project, the researchers will conduct a series of experiments to examine the role of supply-side anticipation of discrimination in the labor market. In the first study, the researchers will run a laboratory experiment to test whether individuals are averse to discriminatory environments. That is, are subjects willing to forego profits in order to avoid facing discrimination? Literature on fairness suggests that individuals may be averse to discriminatory rules, but this theory has not been directly tested. Evidence of discrimination aversion would provide theoretical insight into mechanisms leading to wage gaps, which may be masked as preferences. In the second study, the researchers will run an information experiment to investigate beliefs about a signal of potential discrimination in the labor market and to analyze how people respond to information about this signal. Together, these studies have the potential to provide a more holistic view of the theoretical and empirical role of discrimination, through supply-side anticipation of discrimination.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

I conduct an online experiment with 2200 Democrats and Republicans in the US to study beliefs about hiring discrimination against Black workers. I first establish that Democrats believe there is more racial hiring discrimination than Republicans do, and I then evaluate how various pieces of information affect beliefs. I find that Democrats' beliefs about racial hiring discrimination are responsive to information on the Black-White wage gap, while Republicans' beliefs are not. As a result, wage gap information fails to reduce (and even increases) the partisan difference in beliefs about hiring discrimination. Moreover, even after both groups agree about the extent of racial hiring discrimination, participants change their opinions about whether it is a problem in line with politically motivated reasoning. Together, these findings highlight key challenges in using information to reduce polarization. Over the lifespan of this grant, the study was designed, fielded to a sample of over 2200 Americans, analyzed, and written into a paper. This paper, entitled&nbsp;\"Belief Polarization about Racial Discrimination in Hiring: Evidence from an Information Experiment\", served as the first chapter in co-PI Royer's dissertation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the second project, the PI and co-PI investigate how labor market discrimination affects job search among employees. Theoretical models of labor market discrimination demonstrate how supply-side perceptions of discrimination may play a crucial role in the persistence and exacerbation of group-level wage gaps (e.g., Coate and Loury, 1993; Lang et al, 2005). Yet, empirical research on the relevance and role of discrimination anticipation among employees is limited due to the difficulties associated with measuring responses to discrimination alone in the labor market. To address these difficulties, we simulate a labor market in the laboratory in which participants complete real-effort tasks for a piece-rate wage and a possible bonus. Each participant works for either Company A or Company B. The only difference between Company A and Company B is that Company A gives all its workers the same payment scheme, while Company B discriminates by giving some workers an advantage in pay. The 'discriminated' workers in our design face the exact same payment scheme in both firms. We elicit workers' preferences for working at each firm using a willingness-to-pay elicitation (via an incentive-compatible multiple price list). Because discriminated workers face the same payment scheme in both firms, any willingness-to-pay to work for Company A over Company B suggests an aversion to discrimination.&nbsp;Our design consists of three conditions assigned at the session-level. In the first condition, male workers face an advantage over female and non-binary workers in Company B. In the second, the gender roles are flipped. That is, female and non-binary workers face an advantage over male workers in Company B. In the third, randomly assigned Type I workers face an advantage over Type II workers in Company B. In all three conditions, the disadvantaged group faces the same payment scheme in both companies. These conditions enable us to compare worker preferences based on which group faces an advantage in pay in Company B. Over the lifespan of this grant, we have designed the study, collected data from over 200 participants, and are analyzing the data.
