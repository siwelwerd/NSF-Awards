 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the advent of revolutionary technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), cloud computing, big data, and Internet of Things (IoT), secure knowledge management (SKM) continues to be an important research area that deals with methodologies for systematically gathering, organizing, and disseminating information in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. The recent development of AI in the security field shows a promising future, and there is no doubt that AI can provide new ideas and tools for secure knowledge management. In order to prepare the next generation, high caliber researchers in SKM areas, it is important to expose graduate students in state-of-the-art research, such as those covered in the SKM workshop, which was initiated with NSF support in 2004, and has been held every two years.\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on supporting extensive student attendance through travel grants at the SKM 2021 Workshop and foster their interaction with researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government. The supported students will attend presentations and participated in discussions related to the most recent innovations, trends, and concerns including practical challenges encountered and solutions adopted with special emphasis on AI. The value of this event will be the multi-disciplinary exchange with emphasis on topics such as machine learning, privacy, trust, risk, and social and economic aspects, and technology domains such as IoT, cloud computing and big data. Topics include (a) cybersecurity, privacy, and ethics of AI, and (b) AI tools to enhance cybersecurity, trust, and privacy. The conference includes graduate students and makes a concerted effort to reach out to students and faculty of minority institutions. The students that attend this event will get a better understanding of cutting edge topics in these STEM areas, and a clearer picture of the state-of-the-discipline.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
