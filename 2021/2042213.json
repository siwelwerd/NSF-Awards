 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrothermal fluids venting from the oceanic crust are a source of organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) for the deep biosphere. Organic C and N provide food and energy for the deep ocean ecosystems and play an important role in oceanic C and N cycles. This project will explore how organic C and N are generated and degraded in seafloor hydrothermal systems, and in particular, how Earth-abundant minerals and metals influence the fate and transformations of these organic compounds. This project aims to establish an interdisciplinary program between geoscience and chemistry, with a strong integration between research and education. The proposed project will provide training and research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, especially for those from underrepresented groups and ethnic minorities. The education plan will also contribute to the development of a new graduate program in geoscience and environmental science at Oakland University.\r\n\r\nIdentifying the hydrothermal chemistry and pathways of organic C and N is vital for understanding the input and output of deep ocean organic inventory, uncovering food and energy sources in the deep biosphere, and predicting future C and N emissions from the oceanic lithosphere. Unlocking these hydrothermal pathways and mechanisms represents the first step toward a comprehensive understanding of organic C and N synthesis, transformation, and cycling in the deep ocean. This project will develop new chemical approaches and model organic systems to address the knowledge gaps in: (i) C-C bond breaking and forming mechanisms and hydrothermal redox chemistry of organic C; and (ii) hydrothermal synthetic pathways of organic N and their interconversions. The research will particularly focus on the roles of minerals and dissolved metals in organic transformations in hydrothermal fluids, and a suite of analytical techniques including gas and liquid chromatography, high-resolution mass spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction will assist in investigating these organic-inorganic interactions. In addition, the project will innovatively bridge hydrothermal geochemistry to sustainable chemistry via incorporating the concept of sustainability into geoscience research. Geomimicry toolbox that uses Earth-abundant materials as green catalysts/reagents for chemical synthesis will also be further developed to address challenges in industry and expand the range of sustainable resources for green chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
