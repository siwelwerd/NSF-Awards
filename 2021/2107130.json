 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. South Carolina State University seeks to enhance the quality of STEM education for undergraduate students enrolled in the chemistry and physics programs by augmenting the delivery of instructional and research materials. Specifically, the proposal outlines strategies to implement cyberlearning instructional videos, building on a successful model piloted by departmental faculty. These efforts will also be coupled with a partnership with the local Orangeburg Country School District to bolster teacher-student engagement in discipline-specific research. The project aims to enhance the recruitment, retention, and persistence of underrepresented students, who may ultimately enter the STEM workforce or pursue graduate STEM degrees.  \r\n\r\nThe goals of this project include (1): transformation of the chemistry and physics curriculum delivery methods and content; and (2): setting the stage for enrollment growth in the two majors. Goal 1 will transform the method of delivery in many chemistry and physics courses while also creating a significant library of online material for use at South Carolina State University, as well as for distribution to a wider academic community. Goal 2 will use a multifaceted approach to address awareness, recruitment, retention, and persistence. Activities include expanded use of social media, freshmen immersion in small research projects, and engagement of high school teacher-student pairs in conducting on-campus research.  Overall, the project aims to develop a recruitment and retention framework in chemistry and physics, that has the potential to result in enrollment growth in each program, increases student long-term persistence in STEM, and serve as a model for other institutional contexts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The first year of the project experienced a major delay in implementing both goals. This was due to the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic including limiting face-to-face group interactions and, critically, the long delays experienced by our team in acquiring digital cameras and other equipment due to supply chain issues. We did not make significant progress on Catalyst goals until the summer of 2022, near the end of Year 1 of the project.\r\n\n\n We were very successful in combining resources and activities among the chemistry and physics faculty and students at SCSU. We cohosted numerous events such as a meet-and-greet at the beginning of the semester, talks and presentations by faculty and visiting scientists and hands-on interactions between the undergraduates and visiting high school students. Additionally, we partnered with the SCSU Admissions and Recruitment teams and saw a small but noticeable increase in the number of majors during the three years of Catalyst.

We posted additional videos to our existing set of physics videos that are widely used by our own general physics classes as well as high school and other university physics classes. Those videos can be accessed at: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaFv2MwLbQ_6wqEDUDXjBqMDTa5mTGbme and a summary video at https://youtu.be/9oOv-HbNCg8 includes examples of the numerous activities supported by the Catalyst project at SCSU.\r\n\n\n Partnering with the Orangeburg School District was also successful. During the summer of 2022 and again in 2023 we were able to support two teams each summer, one chemistry and one physics. Each team consisted of a high school teacher and one of their students.

The high school teachers, in turn, either brought their entire chemistry and physics class to SCSU during the next year for a hands-on lab experience and/or invited SCSU faculty into their classroom to carry out experiential learning. Additional recruitment trips were made by the SCSU chemistry and physics faculty to the high schools. As was hoped, some of those connections are continuing past the end of the project in July 2024. For example, in the spring of 2025, the SCSU physics faculty will be providing resources and instructional support for a high school physics class taught in the Orangeburg County School District.\r\n\n\n The greatest impact of this project was to bring together the chemistry and physics faculty at SCSU to work toward improving both majors which suffer from low enrollment. The legacy of Catalyst goes beyond the achievements above.
