MOE personnel will also provide mooring operations expertise and will participate on the deployment cruise being staged from Kirkenes, Norway. WHOI will define the science and instrumentation requirements prior to the construction of the moorings by taking into consideration environmental factors (such as ocean currents and sea ice). Following the design phase, the UAF and MOE teams will oversee the construction of the moorings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
