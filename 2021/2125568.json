Innovative approaches are warranted to address seemingly intractable issues and ensure progress. This project combines data collection, quantitative analysis, social and behavioral sciences and simulations to elucidate factors that underlie the career trajectories of African American women.  These findings can, then, provide insights for the development of meaningful strategies and interventions to increase the participation and career success of African American women in engineering and computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
