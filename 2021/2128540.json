 "awd_abstract_narration": "Radio spectrum is the raw material of the modern connected economy. Today, all usable spectrum is assigned for one purpose or another. However, there is more and more demand for wireless systems, such as 5G and Next-G, and thus more demand for the spectrum. In some bands, existing spectrum users share their spectrum with other users when they are not using it. This is the concept of dynamic spectrum sharing. Legacy spectrum sharing techniques, such as those used in the Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band, have been effective.  However, as we proceed to share even more spectrum where there are complex spectrum operations, especially satellite bands, more sophisticated sharing and dynamic policies are needed. Spectrum sharing in these bands is more complex due to passive incumbents, fades due to rainfall and other environmental effects, the inability to move incumbents, and the often-critical nature and high sensitivity of the incumbent's application.  This project proposes to create a holistic, multi-disciplinary, context-aware spectrum sharing approach to address the spectrum coexistence of broadband wireless systems in satellite bands. Such an approach will enable more effective sharing, allowing the new applications promised by 5G and Beyond, while at the same time providing more protection for legacy applications such as satellite communication, weather forecasting, positioning, and radio astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will result in following key technical innovations: (1) context-aware spectrum sharing and interference analysis tools for developing policy recommendations; (2) an implementation of a prioritization approach for context-aware dynamic spectrum sharing; and (3) an interference-resilient context-aware PHY layer to enable robust and seamless adaptation of user quality of service to meet the demands under varying contextual factors, and finally (4) simulation and experimental demonstrations, to assess, validate, and demonstrate proposed policies as well as their implementation using various framework features and algorithms. Experimentation will occur in the 12 GHz band using Virginia Tech\u2019s Fixed Satellite Service facility.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
