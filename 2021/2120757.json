 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum mechanics governs the behavior of matter at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. Many key technological developments of the 20th century\u2014such as the laser, the transistor, and magnetic resonance imaging\u2014relied on understanding quantum mechanics through simplified models. However, such approaches cannot address the behavior of complex quantum phenomena arising in systems with many interacting components. The promise of quantum science and technology depends on overcoming this obstacle by building a well-controlled, well-characterized quantum system that can reliably simulate the behavior of matter at small scales. Such a quantum simulator will represent a landmark in our understanding of quantum phenomena. The Institute for Robust Quantum Simulation will address this goal by combining theoretical studies with experimental implementations on several leading hardware platforms. In addition, the Institute will work to address the shortage of talent caused by rapid growth of quantum industry by training and mentoring graduate students and postdocs. New K-12 curricula will make quantum concepts more attractive and accessible to a diverse set of youth, ensuring the long-term future of the workforce. University courses developed in partnership with minority-serving institutions will engage a broader set of students in quantum science and technology. Workshops and degree programs for professionals will offer a clear perspective on the possible utility of quantum science and technology.\r\n\r\nThe Institute for Robust Quantum Simulation will use quantum simulation to gain insight into, and thereby exploit, the rich behavior of complex quantum systems. Combining expertise in computer science, engineering, and physics, the team will address the grand challenge of robustly simulating classically intractable quantum systems of practical interest by exploring the theoretical foundations of quantum algorithms and error correction in conjunction with experimental implementations of reconfigurable quantum simulators on four leading hardware platforms: trapped ions, arrays of Rydberg atoms, quantum photonics with solid-state defects, and superconducting circuits. The team will employ tight collaboration between theory and experiment to co-design near-term simulation protocols with current and next-generation devices, with joint development of optical and microwave control techniques across different experimental platforms facilitating rapid advances in system size and controllability. Three major challenges facing the attempts to realize quantum simulators will be addressed: verifying the correctness of quantum simulations, characterizing and mitigating noise, and developing large-scale systems capable of advancing science and technology. Researchers will engage the broader research community with events including summer schools and a new flagship conference on quantum simulation. They will create outreach and education programs that engage diverse groups of students in quantum science, introduce cross-disciplinary undergraduate specializations in quantum information, and provide quantum information training for postgraduates and professionals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
