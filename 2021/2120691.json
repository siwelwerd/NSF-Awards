This doctoral dissertation research project compares whole-genomes of various species to examine the evolutionary processes and biological mechanisms explaining body size reduction in primates. The project leverages historical museum collections to generate novel whole genomes of primate species that fill important gaps in genomic databases. All data generated in this study will be made publicly available to provide additional research opportunities beyond the scope of this project. Outcomes of this research contribute to the understanding of primate genetic architecture, thus allowing a better contextualization of human genomic variation in an evolutionary framework. Moreover, this project extends bioinformatics training opportunities and accessibility of students from historically underrepresented groups.\r\n \r\nConvergent evolution provides compelling evidence that similar ecological circumstances can lead to similar evolutionary solutions. However, the role of natural selection in primate size reduction remains largely speculative, especially when it comes to understanding how adaptation occurs at the molecular level. It is not clear if all small-sized primates evolved such diminutive body size via changes in the same genetic mechanisms, or if changes in different combinations of genes and regulatory sequences could lead to similar outcomes. To address these standing questions, the investigators will compare whole-genome sequences of pairs of miniaturized and non-miniaturized species to access the degree of similarity at the molecular level and the pace of molecular evolution. This research specifically examines: (1) whether small-sized species share the same genetic underpinnings; (2) evidence of selection acting in protein-coding regions related to size reduction in primates. Results will inform a more general understanding of how bodily variation arises over evolutionary history.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Among primates, for example, it has been suggested that there has been a trend of body size increase over time. These size shifts happened together with encephalization, species diversification, adaptations to varied habitats and lifestyles, including in the hominin lineage. The recent discovery of two small-statured archaic hominins (<em>H. floresiensis</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>H. luzonensis</em>) has shown that body size changes in hominins has not always follow a trajectory of increase over time, thus intensifying discussions about adaptive size reduction among biological anthropologists. Primates, represent the third-most diverse group of mammals in terms of species richness, encompassing over 500 species. Interestingly, multiple living primate species have repeatedly evolved extremely miniaturized body size (40 to 200 grams), a process known as convergent evolution. Convergent evolution provides compelling evidence that similar body sizes may have evolved in response to similar selective factors, yet the role of adaptation in primate convergent size reduction remains speculative. These episodes of repeated evolution offer a unique opportunity to study the genetic mechanisms behind adaptive evolution, a process that is still poorly understood.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To investigate the molecular basis of size reduction in primates, this project asked if primates with extreme miniaturized body size have evolved such similar characteristics due to the same changes in their genetic makeup. To do that, we studied the genomes of miniaturized primates because the DNA of organisms can provide clues about the genetic instructions to the development of organisms. By comparing the DNA sequences of several organisms, we can identify differences and similarities in these instructions and test if these changes are adaptive. One major challenge to study genomic evolution is to obtain DNA samples of all species of interest.
