 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant will focus on the future of work challenges for strength and movement training \r\nprofessionals(SMTPs) that include physical therapists, occupational therapists, and personal trainers. These \r\nworkers make up a field that is essential to injury prevention and recovery, predominantly female, and \r\n924,000 strong growing much faster than average (15-29% per year). Unfortunately, this field is currently \r\nunderscored by job strain, administrative burden, and burn out. SMTPs are facing an increasing remote care \r\ntrend (accelerated by the COVID pandemic), and outcome-based reimbursement has been evolving over \r\nthe last decade. The future of work in this area will require versatile and affordable tools to collect objective  and clear performance metrics. With advances in human strength, movement, and stability monitoring with  wearable sensors, combined with machine learning there is an opportunity to drive client/patient  accountability, give better insights into progress, and enrich increasing popular remote training sessions. \r\nThis will give future workers in this area greater work flexibility, improve outcomes, and create more room \r\nfor the human connection both trainer/therapist and client/patient draw satisfaction from. The project will \r\nleverage a recently developed technology that can track a person\u2019s performance during strength training. It \r\nmeasures strength, range and speed of motion, rest time, number of reps and sets, force applied to the \r\nexercise equipment, and power. Algorithms use these data to provide detailed reports on a person\u2019s \r\nperformance with accessible visualization. This planning grant will help develop a research agenda that\r\nincludes all the necessary convergent disciplines to transform the future of work in this area and provide \r\nthe industry with a much-needed tool that promotes greater job satisfaction and reduced job strain through \r\nincreased training successes. In addition, it will enable future workers in this area to be more accessible and  enable more flexible access to rehabilitation, which will mean faster return to work after injury and more  broadly improve wellness and reduce disease burden in the general population.  This project will bring together several disciplines, including engineers, social scientists, strength and  movement training scientists, and economists. The investigator team is structured to achieve multiple  convergent goals. This planning grant will seek to establish a clear landscape of the work context through  qualitative research including a series of worker and stakeholder interviews and review of relevant  healthcare policies. It will also focus on the development of a minimum viable prototype to collect data  from the appropriate body segment or strength training accessory, algorithms to appropriately interpret the  sensor data, and an initial web application. Finally, it will enable the development and evaluation of a  training module with SMTPs. Each of the three research thrusts \u2013 future work, future workers, and future  technology \u2013 will be considered when evaluating the outcomes of the planning grant. Quantitative methods  will be used where appropriate to judge things like technology performance and qualitative assessments  such as interviews and standardized surveys will be used to assess the social and perception driven elements.  This project has been funded by the Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier cross-directorate  program to promote deeper basic understanding of the interdependent human-technology partnership in  work contexts by advancing design of intelligent work technologies that operate in harmony with human workers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We researched existing references and interviewed with a number of strength and movement training professionals (SMTPs) and other key stakeholders across healthcare (hospitals, clinics, senior homes, etc.), sports (college teams, professional sports) and fitness (gym chains, studios, online businesses). We identified responsibilities, work infrastructure and causes of issues for SMTP workers. Overall, we 1. interviewed with 67 people from personal trainers, physical therapists, and strength coaches, 2. surveyed from 281 strength coaches, consumers, and (amateur) athletes, and 3. performed 11 interviews with gym owners and manager, senior homes (director of fitness program), NCAA &amp; NSCA (board member in charge of academia and research), and HIMSS (Administrators and providers, hospital manager, IT staff). We used this information to develop assessment tools that enable more effective remote sessions and instrument strength and movement tests. The technology consists of three elements: (1) a modular electro-mechanical system that can be fixed to different body segments and exercise equipment, (2) motion tracking algorithms that measure position in 3D space, and (3) graphical user interface. The modular hardware system includes Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), which measure accelerations and angular accelerations. Using this sensor system, we developed a learning-based algorithm that automatically detects when a person starts and ends every set of strength training exercises and determines exercise type.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit: An end-to-end machine learning is designed based on the understanding that human motion, despite its high dimensionality, can exhibit limited patterns and reduced variability during the same activity. To maximize practicality of a wearable sensing system, we limited the number of IMUs used in this work to a maximum of two and focused on partial-body kinematics estimation. We evaluated the performance of the model in a dynamic functional scenario of estimating wrist and chest trajectories during various strength training exercises.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts: This research will focus on developing tools that enable strength and movement training professionals to be able to better track and quantify workouts. This can benefit future workers and enable future of this type of work to be more equitable and inclusive.&nbsp; With the success of this program, we expect to see positive outcomes continue in the long term with significant broader impact. SMTP industry impact: We expect this research to lead to more effective workers with greater capacity for remote work, greater work flexibility reduces job turnover and allows primary care givers (traditionally women) to stay in the workforce in the face of increased family pressures. It will also provide the industry with a much-needed tool to meet the demands of outcome-based incentives and promotes greater job satisfaction and reduced job strain through increased training successes. We see the potential for strength and movement training to be more accessible and more flexible access to rehabilitation will mean faster return to work after injury. In addition, we expect this research to enable new scalable programs for training and conditioning to help people not get injured on the job and more broadly improve wellness and reduce disease burden in the general population.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/16/2024<br>\nModified by: Conor&nbsp;Walsh</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2129012/2129012_10769825_1705442103352_Overview_of_Activity_in_the_Loop_Kinematics_Estimator_v2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2129012/2129012_10769825_1705442103352_Overview_of_Activity_in_the_Loop_Kinematics_Estimator_v2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"2.\tOverview of Activity in the Loop Kinematics Estimator\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2129012/2129012_10769825_1705442103352_Overview_of_Activity_in_the_Loop_Kinematics_Estimator_v2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"2.\tOverview of Activity in the Loop Kinematics Estimator\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Illustration of the different components of the machine learning model.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Harvard Biodesign Lab</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Conor&nbsp;Walsh\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2.\tOverview of Activity in the Loop Kinematics Estimator</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2129012/2129012_10769825_1705442162783_Estimation_Result_Example_from_Activity_Classifier_v2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2129012/2129012_10769825_1705442162783_Estimation_Result_Example_from_Activity_Classifier_v2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"3.\tEstimation Result Example from Activity Classifier\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2129012/2129012_10769825_1705442162783_Estimation_Result_Example_from_Activity_Classifier_v2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"3.\tEstimation Result Example from Activity Classifier\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example results for classification and kinematic estimation accuracy</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Harvard Biodesign Lab</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Conor&nbsp;Walsh\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">3.\tEstimation Result Example from Activity Classifier</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2129012/2129012_10769825_1705441552603_Overview_of_Wearable_Technology_and_Quantifying_Strength_Training_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2129012/2129012_10769825_1705441552603_Overview_of_Wearable_Technology_and_Quantifying_Strength_Training_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"1.\tOverview of Wearable Technology and Quantifying Strength Training\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2129012/2129012_10769825_1705441552603_Overview_of_Wearable_Technology_and_Quantifying_Strength_Training_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"1.\tOverview of Wearable Technology and Quantifying Strength Training\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Overview of the concept of extracting quantitative metrics during strength training using classification and kinematics estimation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Harvard Biodesign Lab</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Conor&nbsp;Walsh\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">1.\tOverview of Wearable Technology and Quantifying Strength Training</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
