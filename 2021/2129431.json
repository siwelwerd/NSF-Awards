 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support an Alvin Science Verification Expedition to conduct dives to abyssal depths, down to 6500m, in the Puerto Rico Trench and at the Mid-Cayman Rise following completion of the major overhaul and upgrade.\r\n\r\nThe science verification expedition will test and document the improved and new HOV Alvin systems and operations at increased depths down to 6500m, made possible by the Alvin Upgrade. Science verification activities will be guided by input from the community workshop (Summer 2020) on priorities in abyssal research for the coming decade.\r\n\r\nThe project will offer early career scientists an opportunity to observe and participate in an HOV Alvin expedition (most likely for the first time), providing critical training to advance their research careers through the use of this national asset.\r\nThe project will engage with K-12 students and researchers in nations and territories adjacent to work sites to ensure that indigenous populations can participate in and benefit from the research conducted. High-bandwidth ship-to-shore communications will be critical to this effort as COVID restrictions will prevent in-person participation by these scientists and students and will prevent the science party from being ashore in these nations and territories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
