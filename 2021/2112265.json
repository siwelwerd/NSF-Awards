This CREST-PRF project is aligned with the research focus of the CREST Center for Environmental Neuroscience at the University of Puerto Rico. The goal of this research is for the post doctoral fellow to receive training in animal neurophysiology and developmental biology. The proposed research will build on the fellow's background in epigenetics, molecular biology, and ecotoxicology. The postdoctoral fellow intends to engage with the public to promote conservation efforts focused on coastal urban ecosystems, broaden the participation of groups underrepresented in biology through active mentoring and teaching, and promote scientific collaboration between Puerto Rican universities and minority serving institutions in South Florida.\r\n\r\nAccumulating evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms, which are influenced by developmental and environmental signals, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and potentially modulate behavior and memory. However, it is unclear how environmental-exposure-driven epigenetic modifications could affect short and long-term behavioral responses. The intent of the proposed work is to disentangle epigenetic effects in the establishment and plasticity of behavioral responses to stress. The proposed work will investigate linkages between molecular, cellular, and behavioral responses to hypoxia; evaluate the inheritance of molecular and narrow plasticity to stressors and the resulting behavior outcomes; and studying these plastic responses in coastal urban environments with a recent history of hypoxic events. Neurohistology methods, including immunohistochemistry and dye injection are expected to  enable the postdoctoral fellow to work on individual identified neurons. Coupled with his prior training, the post-doctoral fellow has the potential to be uniquely positioned to embark on an independent career studying epigenetic impacts of environmental perturbations on neurological function.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

On one hand, coastal hypoxic and anoxic (oxygen depletion) events are increasingly frequent, causing massive mortality, reducing reproductive success, and impacting animal physiology; and on the other, cellular hypoxia is involved in other physiological stress responses. Understanding the response/resistance mechanisms to hypoxia in appropriate models is critical to mitigate ecosystem impacts, and design appropriate intervention strategies. Using sea-hares as models, we studied molecular mechanisms involved in the response/resistance to hypoxia, contributing to the development of <em>Aplysia californica </em>and <em>Bursatella leachii</em> for the study of hypoxia responses in temperate and tropical environments. Given the multidisciplinary and collaborative nature of this work, this award provided vast opportunities for training and professional development of the PI and a large group of students, increasing the impact of the research and broadening participation of underrepresented groups in Puerto Rico and South Florida.</p>\n<p>This project facilitated training in cross-disciplinary research to the PI and students from fields like Biology, Environmental Sciences and Chemistry. It helped participants to hone academic and professional skills including &ndash; but not limited to &ndash; research specific methods, critical thinking, interdisciplinary communication, and data analysis. For PI&rsquo;s professional development as a researcher, teacher and mentor, the project enhanced scientific independence, fostered valuable collaborations, provided teaching and mentoring opportunities, and allowed training in a specific niche to develop a career in academia. Building on these experiences, the award resulted in several manuscripts, presentations, and outreach activities, broadening participation of minorities in STEM as evidenced by over 85% of the participants being from underrepresented genders and/or ethnicities.</p>\n<p>In our work we targeted one of the central knowledge gaps in ecology and evolution: how the exposure of an organism impacts their unexposed descent. We observed that both studied sea-hares are very resistant to hypoxia, experiencing regular hypoxic events in their natural habitats. However, when maintained in controlled conditions, such resistance is transferred to the next generation, but lost after two generations in the case of <em>Aplysia californica</em>. This indicated that regular exposure to hypoxia might activate mechanisms involved in such resistance, this experience is passed to the next generation and fades away in the absent of exposure. We evaluated how this process affected gene expression, behavior, and epigenetic mechanisms (heritable mechanisms that change how genes are expressed without involving changes in the DNA sequence, potential modulators of these responses). Patterns of gene expression varied significantly between resistant and sensitive sea-hares under controlled and hypoxic conditions. Changes in DNA methylation (an epigenetic mechanism linked with gene expression regulation and development) were also observed in response to hypoxia in both resistant and sensitive animals. Similarly, we observed differences in other epigenetic mechanisms like microRNAs and histone post-translational modifications. This resulted in different behavioral responses to hypoxia, with resistant animals showing normal neurological reflexes during and after hypoxia pulses for up to 7 days, while sensitive ones showed impaired reflexes after 4 days. To evaluate the hypothesis that resistance was mediated by exposure and inherited across generations, we performed a transgenerational experiment exposing first-generation unexposed juvenile animals to hypoxic or controlled conditions for two months before crossing them. We observed that the offspring of unexposed parents (second generation with no exposure) showed reflex impairments like those observed before in sensitive animals, while the descent of the exposed animals showed no impairment. Hybrid crosses (either with mother or father exposed) showed intermediate responses. These results support our hypothesis that resistance mechanisms are activated in response to recurrent exposure, it involves epigenetic regulation, and it is inherited transgenerationally.</p>\n<p>Showing the transgenerational inheritance of environmentally induced resistance and the participation of epigenetic mechanisms in this process will speed up the use of epigenetics as accurate biomarkers of exposure in practical applications like ecosystem restoration. This is particularly relevant in the current climatic scenario with global change effects over ecosystems being overwhelmingly evident, and uncertainty of populations persistence glooming predictions. This work contributed to an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms mediating multi-level responses to environmental stressors and their intra- and inter-generational consequences in the nervous system of marine mollusks. We produced and made available several genomic resources and datasets valuable for the community, including a de-novo transcriptome of <em>B. leachii</em> and the first full methylome of <em>Aplysia californica.</em> Alongside our results, there is increasing evidence suggesting that organisms have the capacity to acclimate to changing conditions through epigenetic-mediated phenotypic plasticity. Our work contribute to the ongoing challenge of the current paradigm of mutation-dependent evolution, and consequently contributes to reshaping disciplines like toxicology, molecular biology, conservation, and even human health.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/13/2023<br>\nModified by: Javier&nbsp;A&nbsp;Rodriguez-Casariego</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2112265/2112265_10768718_1702483415637_IMG_0728--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2112265/2112265_10768718_1702483415637_IMG_0728--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Exposure system\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2112265/2112265_10768718_1702483415637_IMG_0728--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Exposure system\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Flow through exposure system at the National Resource for Aplysia (UM)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Javier Rodriguez Casariego</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Javier&nbsp;A&nbsp;Rodriguez-Casariego\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Exposure system</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2112265/2112265_10768718_1702483666572_IMG_7F0F08EDC925_1--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2112265/2112265_10768718_1702483666572_IMG_7F0F08EDC925_1--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Aplysia californica\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2112265/2112265_10768718_1702483666572_IMG_7F0F08EDC925_1--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Aplysia californica\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mating pair of Aplysia californica with egg mass.
