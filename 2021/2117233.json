 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award supports the acquisition of an Electroencephalography (EEG) system (ANT Neuro eego mylab128-channel) to establish the first EEG laboratory for brain imaging at Eastern Michigan University (EMU). EEG is a non-invasive human brain imaging method that measures neural electrical activity in the human brain arising from thinking and behavior with millisecond accuracy. The EEG laboratory critically expands neuroscience training and research in the Departments of Psychology, Communication Sciences and Disorders, and the interdisciplinary Neuroscience Program (Psychology, Biology, Chemistry). The EEG laboratory also has a substantial regional impact on the institutional community. EMU is recognized as one of the most diverse universities in the Midwest. The EEG laboratory allows EMU to contribute to the broader aims of the scientific community to recruit, retain, and promote members of minoritized groups into STEM fields. The laboratory allows for workshops to train local and regional faculty and students on neuroimaging, serve as a catalyst for the development of research assistantships and fellowships targeted for underrepresented students, including those from rural communities, and be central in creating a mentoring partnership with the McNair Scholars Program for students interested in EEG research. The EEG laboratory enhances collaborative research efforts within EMU, with partnering regional institutions, and foster national collaborations in developmental neuroscience.\r\n\r\nKnowledge of the brain mechanisms underlying fundamental cognitive and behavioral processes (e.g. attention and language) in infants/children and older adults, the precise timing of developmental changes, and knowledge of crucial environmental factors that impact this timing has lagged behind research with younger adults and remains a frontier of investigation. EEG is non-invasive and well-tolerated by infants and children. This team examines the EEG signals and developmental timing of key cognitive and behavioral processes including attention and working memory, motor control, self-regulation, sleep, and communication. EEG event-related potentials, frequency (power), and brain connectivity in developing neural networks are explored. The electrophysiological mechanisms (spectral power and connectivity) underpinning the development of the default mode and dorsal attention networks and orienting system in infancy/toddlerhood are examined to clarify the relationships between attention and social-communication. The neural correlates of change of bimanual and unimanual motor control across the lifespan as well as the neural underpinnings of inconsistent hand preference and hand dominance are being investigated. Investigators are examining developmental changes and environmental precursors of event-related potentials hypothesized to underlie self-regulation. Investigation of the functions of napping, including neurophysiology and behavior, in early childhood provide vital information on reciprocal relations between the development of sleep-wake regulation and the development of attention. Finally, few studies have examined the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying working memory-linguistic processes in older adults. EEG is being used to explore the long-term learning effects and the compensatory processes that occur in older adults.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

EEG, a non-invasive brain imaging technique, records the spontaneous electrical activity of the neurons in the brain. Broadly, the achieved project outcomes included the: 1) development of the Behavioral Research and Imagin Neurodevelopment (BRAIN) lab at EMU, 2) training of faculty and students in contemporary cognitive neuroscience methods at the human/systems level for the first time in the institution&rsquo;s history, and 3) execution of faculty and student-led research projects testing sophisticated models to understand human behavior at an electrophysiological and systems level.

Three of the PIs and their students have executed pilot investigations of: 1) attention/executive functions in preschool children (Lajiness-O&rsquo;Neill), 2) motor control and hemispheric lateralization in adults (Bo), and linguistic-cognitive processes in adults (Hashimoto), while the agendas of the remaining faculty will be underway.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Lab Setup and Infrastructure</strong>: The Behavioral Research and Imaging Neurodevelopment (BRAIN) lab (<a href=\"https://www.emich.edu/psychology/labs/eeg-lab/index.php\">https://www.emich.edu/psychology/labs/eeg-lab/index.php</a>) is now a fully functioning EEG imaging lab for undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty at EMU. Given the original NSF award, the team was able to secure six additional internal and external awards totaling $34,833 to: 1) support the acquisition of additional image analysis lab equipment, 2) train faculty and students in event-related potential (ERP) analysis (the brain&rsquo;s response to a sensory, cognitive, or motor event), and to 3) secure psychometric measures to execute the proposed areas of research.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Training and Instruction in Acquisition and Analyses</strong>: The team established the formal operations plan and developed a technical training method/manual to be used by subsequent generations of faculty/students.

Further training was undertaken on the use of EEGLAB and ERPLAB (preprocessing methods) under the direction of Dr. Yanni Liu (University of Michigan) and Dr. Emily Kappenman (San Diego State University). The team is continuing to develop statistical methods to examine differences in EEG brain networks across development. In addition to faculty, the lab has trained approximately 15 graduate students (clinical psychology doctoral and masters) and 11 undergraduates (neuroscience), with 27% representing racial and/or ethnic minorities.
