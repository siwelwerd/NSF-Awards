 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve clinical care for scoliosis patients.  Scoliosis, a sideways curvature of the spine, affects 6-9 million individuals in the US, or 2-3% of the population, and has estimated healthcare costs of $3.5 billion by 2028. Current treatments for scoliosis include bracing and/or spinal surgery. Patients are often treated with a rigid thoracic scoliosis brace that does not typically provide curve correction. Compliance with wearing the brace can be challenging. The proposed technology is an intelligent, active brace that applies corrective forces to the spine via a dynamic, adjustable platform and reports compliance through its sensors. This personalized system may improve clinical outcomes at reduced cost. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to advance the development of an innovative scoliosis brace. The proposed system is designed to be comfortable to increase wear compliance by patients.  The brace has a dynamic mechanism that can be adjusted to provide continuous pressure, and will have Bluetooth-connected sensors allowing parents and physicians to ensure treatment quality.  The new technology will accommodate patient growth and curve correction while maintaining a precise fit, and may  lessen the social stigma of wearing a brace. In this Phase II proposal, functionality and durability of the smart pad and sensor system in a clinical setting will be verified, feedback from end users (orthotists, spine specialists, patients and families) on the mobile application and physician dashboard will be collected, and the system economics and fabrication will be optimized.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
