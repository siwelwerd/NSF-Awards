 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Plant Genome Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Madeline Oravec is \"Evaluation and Exploitation of Temporally-Regulated Hormone Signaling for Enhanced Cold Tolerance in Brassica rapa.\" The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Minnesota and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Kathleen Greenham.\r\n\r\nCold temperatures limit geographical range and seasonal yield of crop production. Development of cold tolerant crops is therefore a consistent goal of plant breeding and genetic engineering efforts. Plant productivity is dependent on a balance between stress response and growth. One way that plants achieve this is through time-of-day specific hormone signaling and gene expression. Brassica rapa is a diverse crop species, encompassing a wide variety of crops, including sarson (mustard seed), Chinese cabbage, bok choy, turnip, leafy vegetables, and oilseed. This project uses multiple approaches to investigate how differences in cold tolerance across B. rapa varieties are related to time-of-day specific gene expression, hormone signaling, and physiological response to cold. This research aims to directly enhance the cold tolerance of cold-sensitive B. rapa varieties. Findings from this work will provide insights into time-of-day variation in hormone signaling and stress response in plants, and the approach will be widely applicable to improvement of other crops. Training objectives include obtaining skills in transcriptomics, physiology, and synthetic biology, as well as in independent research, science communication, and mentorship. The broader impacts of this project include teaching plant biology modules in minority-serving K-12 schools, direct mentorship of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, and community outreach at local events through participation in the Market Science program.\r\n\r\nPlants coordinate and balance stress response and productivity through circadian and diel regulation of gene expression and hormone signaling. Brassinosteroids are phytohormones that regulate cold stress response and exhibit diel fluctuations. Temporal modification of brassinosteroid signaling could therefore improve cold tolerance without compensating growth and yield. The specific research objectives of this project are to (1) evaluate temporal gene expression patterns of cold responsive brassinosteroid-related genes across diverse cold tolerant and sensitive B. rapa morphotypes, (2) assess changes in cold response and tolerance in B. rapa with varied time-of-day applications of exogenous brassinosteroid, and (3) alter temporal expression of brassinosteroid-responsive transcription factors in B. rapa to enhance cold tolerance. Through interdisciplinary approaches, including transcriptomic analyses, physiological assays, and genetic engineering, this work will leverage pan-genome data and within species variation to evaluate and exploit temporal regulation of brassinosteroid signaling to enhance cold tolerance in B. rapa. This research will advance scientific knowledge of temporal gene regulation and diel hormone signaling in relation to cold stress response. The methods developed will inform future research, breeding, and genetic engineering efforts to manipulate temporal stress response to develop more resilient and stress tolerant crops while maintaining growth and productivity. All scripts will be curated on the Greenham lab Github site (https://github.com/GreenhamLab), generated data will be provided in publications and/or through CyVerse (https://www.cyverse.org/), and synthetic constructs and transgenic lines will be submitted to and made available through the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Research was conducted on the cold stress responses and gene expression patterns of diverse Brassica rapa plants over time. Brassica rapa is an important crop species, which includes crops such as sarson (mustard seed), Chinese cabbage, bak choi, turnip, leafy vegetables, and oilseed. We identified variation in the ways in which different crop-types responded to cold across time, both in terms of physiological responses and gene expression patterns. This work expands scientific knowledge of how plants respond to stress and highlights the importance of considering time in experimental design and in evaluation of holistic stress responses. Findings from this work can be used to inform future research, breeding, and genetic engineering efforts to improve temporal stress responses to develop more resilient and stress tolerant crops while maintaining growth and productivity. This project contributed to my postdoctoral training in both technical research skills and career development in science communication, teaching, and mentorship. In addition to developing essential technical skills in data analysis, large dataset management, and temporal experimentation, I was able to practice skills in science communication and share the findings from this work with diverse audiences by delivering oral and poster presentations at both local and national events. As part of this work, I was additionally awarded the AGBT-Ag Next Gen Leadership Award, providing support and publicity at the AGBT-Ag conference in 2022. Through this work I provided mentorship to two undergraduate students and one graduate student, contributing to both my career development and theirs. These mentorship activities greatly enhanced the educational experience of the two undergraduate students, by providing hands-on research experience, which included research question development, experimental design and planning, data collection and analysis, and communication of research and findings. To foster broader interest and advance education in plant sciences, I developed and delivered a guest lecture and lab on abiotic stress for the Plant Function Lab course, and served as a Focus Scientist for the Biology Saves the World project in the Nature of Life program for all first-year biology students. Finally, as part of this project, we wrote and published a review article on the adaptive nature of the plant circadian clock in natural environments in a high-impact peer-reviewed journal, Plant Physiology. The research outcomes of this work contributed to the understanding and advancement of plant stress responses and resilience. Additionally, all the skills and experiences I gained through this work will be vital in my future career as faculty at a research and teaching institution. This work will likely have far-reaching impact for improving economic and environmental conditions through development of genetically determined enhanced stress response in crop plants. This work also incited important discussions about climate change, how plants respond to our changing climate, and the impact of these on food production and security with students. Additionally, students were exposed to the many types of research and careers they can pursue to address these significant societal issues.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/07/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Madeline&nbsp;W&nbsp;Oravec</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
