 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a collaborative effort lead by Washington University and involving Vanderbilt University, and the University of Pennsylvania to establish an Institute in Critical Quantitative, Computational, and Mixed Methods Training for Underrepresented Scholars. It is designed to mitigate the disparities in the number of underrepresented scholars that utilize quantitative and computational research methods and techniques.  The goals are to enable participants to incorporate quantitative and computational methods in conceptualizing research projects, establish collaborative networks of quantitative and computational research practitioners, and affirm self-efficacy of underrepresented faculty through culturally relevant, asset-focused training opportunities. The use of critical perspectives in race/ethnicity responds to a need for more underrepresented scholars to practice critical quantitative approaches in research to complement the larger number who practice critical qualitative approaches.\r\n\r\nThe Institute will provide a continuum of training, individual coaching, and a follow-up proposal development workshop.  The project team will conduct an assets assessment of 20 researchers, primarily faculty at minority-serving institutions,  recruited to serve as Fellows to establish their baseline needs. The Institute will host a five-day summit to (1) identify possible tensions and transformative practices in using quantitative and computational methods to critically address race and broadening participation in data science and analysis and (2) conduct seminars in data-intensive methods. The curriculum will have a dual focus on core methodological knowledge and specialization and a critical perspective on the use of quantitative and computational methods for research on broadening participation. Topics will include critical theory, research design, fundamentals of quantitative methods, and grant proposal development.  The Institute is expected to stimulate more underrepresented researchers to employ quantitative and computational methods in STEM education research. \r\n\r\nThe project is supported through the EHR Core Research: Building capacity in STEM Education Research (EHR: BCSER) competition that is designed to build individuals' capacity to carry out high quality fundamental STEM education research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
