 "awd_abstract_narration": "Juan Valdez-Moreira is awarded a FY21 Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research (NSF MPS-Ascend) Fellowship to conduct a program of research and activities related to broadening participation by groups underrepresented in Chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley.  The project being performed by Juan Valdez-Moreira, entitled Synthesis and Studies of Single-Molecule Magnets Incorporating Strongly Coupled Two-Coordinate Metal Building Units, is to be conducted under the guidance of mentoring scientist Jeffrey R. Long.  This project is supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.\r\n\r\nSingle-molecule magnets are discrete paramagnetic molecules that can behave as classical bulk magnets at low temperature.  This proposal seeks to design and synthesize new linear single-molecule magnets that can serve as building blocks in the design of multinuclear systems that are linked by ligands that enforce large magnetic coupling.  A goal is development of compounds that retain their magnetic properties at higher (more practical) temperatures.  This work has potential for broad scientific impact because of its strong connections to areas such as data storage, quantum computing and dark matter detection.  In addition to proposed synthetic studies, Dr. Valdez-Moreira will carry out outreach activities, with the aim of reaching non-scientific communities, and the goal of educating and sparking interest in topics related to the proposed research.  He will work with local sections of the American Chemical Society, the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science, and other societies to help advance his broadening participation goals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
