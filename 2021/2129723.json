 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel grant supports five volunteers to attend the 2021 Supercomputing\r\nConference (SC21) scheduled November 15 - 21, 2021 in St. Louis, Missouri, as part of\r\nthe Womening in IT Networking at SC (WINS) program who will participate in building\r\nand operating SCinet, the advanced computer networks which supports the annual\r\nconference. The WINS program, started in 2015, enables talented early to mid-career\r\nwomen from diverse backgrounds and regions of the U.S. research and education IT\r\ncommunity to volunteer to participate in SCinet and experience the hands-on\r\ndevelopment and construction of the conference network.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit associated with the project is to continue the expansion and\r\nbroadening of knowledge and training for women network engineers and information\r\ntechnology professionals who desire to build expertise and continue their education and\r\ncareers in network and computer systems. The broader impact associated with the\r\nprogram is through the diverse representation of organizations and applicant\r\nbackgrounds representing Minority Serving Institutions, Established Program to\r\nStimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) states, and historically underrepresented\r\nminority groups. Through the participation in SC and SCinet, the travel funds provide\r\ntraining, professional development, and career opportunities for women in a workforce\r\nthat has been historically male and non-minority-dominated.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
