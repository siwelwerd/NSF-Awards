 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award will enable the purchase and installation of a Cryogen-Free Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) that will be used for research and education training in fabrication and characterization of new quantum materials and devices. The instrument will be located in the Norfolk State University McDemmond Center for Applied Research (MCAR) and will be available for use by faculty and students. It will also be the only instrument of its kind in the Hampton Roads area with MCAR being centrally a location within a 45 minute drive of six other universities, four community colleges, the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, the NASA Langley Research Center, and the Eastern Virginia Medical School, none of which have local access to this type of equipment. The PPMS system will be used to characterize both basic materials properties and device performance in an accurately controlled environment including temperature and applied magnetic field. This system will have a direct impact on the education, research training, and professional development of at least 20 MS and PhD students in the NSU material science and engineering graduate programs, and over 30 NSU undergraduate STEM majors with the majority of all the participants coming from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. The impact on undergraduates will result from individual student research projects and research training through modules developed for advanced laboratory courses.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nThis major instrumentation is an important addition to Norfolk State University\u2019s materials research infrastructure and will support diverse interdisciplinary materials research projects ranging from fundamental studies of quantum materials, signatures of novel spin-textures in noncentrosymmetric magnets, topological effects and critical phenomena, characterization of novel organic semiconductor and hybrid materials, magnetic nanoparticles for biomedical applications and thin films of rare-earth magnetocaloric and magneto-elastic materials. The Physical Properties Measurement System is equipped with an integrated conduction-cooled superconducting 14 Tesla magnet which is recognized as state-of-the-art high magnetic field and low-temperature system with exceptional stability and sensitivity. This system can cool the sample chamber from room-temperature down to 1.9 K in less than 40 minutes. A dilution refrigerator insert provides the capability to conduct measurements down to 50 mK, essential for probing quantum mechanical phenomena in materials. The sample chamber accommodates a wide range of measurement inserts, all of which allow fully automated data acquisition under computer control over the full range of magnetic field and temperature. A multi-function probe accommodates custom experiments, and a horizontal sample rotator allows magnetoresistance measurements as a function of sample orientation relative to magnetic field. This system provides the capability to measure electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, Hall Effect, and other thermoelectric properties, as well as susceptibility and magnetization. The closed-cycle cryogen-free feature of this system ensures cost-effective and reliable long-term operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
