 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving mathematics content courses for preservice elementary teachers (PSETs) to advance their 21st Century workforce skills as future teachers. Through integrating an innovative ACE (Apply, Connect, Experience) model, this IUSE Engaged Student Learning Level 3 project will engage PSETs in (1) applying learned knowledge and skills to the practice of teaching; (2) connecting crosscutting concepts through STEM inquiries and practices; and (3) experiencing community-based experiential learning through facilitating STEM inquiries.  This project will develop and implement the ACE model in mathematics courses at four institutions which is representative of a wide range of US institutions where advances in PSET preparation is needed.  The ACE model will offer the experiences that link PSETs\u2019 mathematics learning, civic engagement, and professional skills for teaching. This project will assess the impact of ACE mathematics courses on diverse PSETs, elementary school students, and undergraduate mathematics course instructors. New knowledge developed from the project will build research-based evidence regarding effective course design that empowers diverse PSETs in applying mathematics in STEM inquiries and developing pedagogical content knowledge in contexts. \r\n\r\nThis project will engage more than 900 PSETs in STEM learning through implementing the ACE model into four PSET geometry and measurement courses across four institutions, Boise State University, Augusta University, University of Texas at San Antonio, and Kapi\u2019olani Community College, all minority-serving institutions. These PSETs will interact and impact over 1800 diverse elementary school students attending afterschool programs. The implementation of the ACE model will produce six integrated-mathematics enhanced STEM modules and related co-curricular materials and build a sustainable community of practices for teacher educators to promote elementary STEM education. New knowledge developed from the project will build research-based evidence regarding effective course design in engaging PSET learning. Data collection will follow a mixed-methods approach while using online and paper surveys, focus groups, structured interviews, and collection of other documents. An important part of the research conducted throughout the project is the feedback loop of data, analysis, and updates and implementation. The findings will also help build a knowledge base for sustainable collaborations among STEM disciplinary experts, scientists, and STEM education practitioners to improve STEM instructional practices, and to bridge research, practice and learning. Additionally, this project will create sustainable capacities for STEM outreach programs via community engagement of PSETs to serve high-needs students in the local community. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship (Noyce) Program is providing co-funding for this IUSE: EHR project to support the project's preservice teacher preparation goals, which are well-aligned with Noyce Program goals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
