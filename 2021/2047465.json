 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schools have increasingly adopted educational technologies to support learning, monitor student engagement, and track and predict academic performance. These educational technologies may negatively impact schoolchildren if student data are used to create records that lead to unfair discrimination or unconsented use by commercial entities. Many educational technologies used or sponsored by schools are not well regulated. To safeguard children\u2019s privacy, this project investigates the data that educational technologies are gathering on schoolchildren, how and why those data are being used, and by whom they are used. The investigations examine educational technologies  under  remote,  hybrid,  and  in-person  learning  conditions. This project will lead to better understanding by parents, children, and teachers of the impact of educational technologies on children\u2019s privacy and how to curb undesirable data collection and better  maintain  online  privacy. This project is creating after-school  learning  activities for middle school girls, summer programs for college readiness, and parent-focused seminars on the topic of online privacy. It is also creating privacy-related educational resources for college students and providing empirical evidence to inform the regulation of educational technologies.\r\n\r\nThis project studies the privacy effects of educational technologies on children in grades 3\u20137. The studies are being carried out in two of the largest public school districts in the US, Chicago  and  Houston. The investigations include qualitative data collection  of  parents\u2019  and  children\u2019s   experiences  with  educational  technologies, and  qualitative  studies  of  teachers\u2019 views on  educational technologies and data collection practices. The project will inform a taxonomy of the most commonly used educational technologies  in  the  largest  US  school  districts and their impact on schoolchildren\u2019s privacy. The project also includes co-design and evaluation of ways to help parents, children, and teachers better manage educational technologies\u2019 data collection for safeguarding  schoolchildren\u2019s  privacy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
