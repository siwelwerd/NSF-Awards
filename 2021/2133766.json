 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF award supports the travel of U.S. based mathematicians to the international conference \"Math Circles Around the World\" scheduled to take place in St. Petersburg, Russia,  July 1\u20133, 2022, as a satellite to the International Congress of Mathematicians. The conference is dedicated to mathematics enrichment programs and research experiences for school students. Over the next decades these programs will have a major impact on the future development of STEM disciplines in the United States. Early engagement of school students in advanced math activities is today\u2019s investment in the future of science and technology. Participation of the US delegation will inspire more active engagement of professional mathematicians into math outreach programs and help advocate recruitment and retention of diverse populations to math programs for school students. In the long run this experience will have a very positive impact on the scientific community in the United States.\r\n\r\nConference participants will review existing practices of dissemination of mathematics, advertise the achievements of math circle programs in the USA, develop deeper understanding of the context of mathematical culture in different countries, establish new international collaborations, and acquire practical skills that include recruitment and retention of more diverse population into STEM education. The project seeks to broaden the diversity of participation of the meeting and to increase international visibility of the US-based leaders of math circles. Mathematicians at an early stage of their careers and underrepresented groups will especially benefit from the travel support for this conference. More information about the conference is found at the website: https://www.mathcirclesworld.org\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
