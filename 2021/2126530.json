 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a rapid, Pulsed Near-Infrared Photoluminescence (P-NIR-PL) and Stimulated Luminescence (SL) technique with micron spatial resolution, as a state-of-the art photoluminescence dating method for inorganic sediments, with substantially improved precision, accuracy, and turn-around time for sample processing.  Picosecond-NIR-PL is a next-generation analytical platform for inorganic sediments.  The team seeks to capture geochronological data from ~1 to 200,000 years prior.  The approach addresses challenges with sample processing through the rapid detection of overlapping PL signals that will be deconvoluted and correlated to age. If successful, this project will provide new capabilities to geologists and archaeologists working on new geochronological methods for dating volcanic soils, charred materials, and sand/rock materials from future extraterrestrial sites.  A sizable niche market and strong commercialization opportunity exists if optical dating measurements can be performed rapidly and non-destructively, repeatedly with differentiation on the sub single-grain level, and reliably with minimal sample pre-treatment. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project focuses on instrument development to address the immediate demand for an accurate tool for differentiation of quartz and feldspar detection in sediments using an advanced spatial and time-resolved microscopy method with an attached dosing/dating capability for geochronological dating. Separation of PL and SL decays that are previously unexplained will establish a novel geochronological method achieved by expanding the detection into the near-infrared.  A picosecond pulsed laser source with picosecond-to-second resolution in kinetic decay will be combined with high spatial resolution to cover a wide range of excitation/emission profiles that uniquely shorten the time required for a single measurement, from 13 hours to 20 minutes.  Specifically, the combined time-resolved and spatially-resolved components create a powerful technique to distinguish molecular and crystalline environments as well as to distinguishing emissions from similar spectra and unique elemental microstructures.  The proposed activities may advance engineering and science innovation in pulsed optical/NIR dating methods with a focus on high performance, commercial instrument development for rapid sample screening. Establishment of both the state-of-the-art instrumentation and analytical testing service for optical dating will be performed by a new diversified customer segment with implementation of an online geochronological library.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe small business innovation research phase I proposal awarded to Beta Analytic aimed to address longstanding scientific challenges in photoluminescence geochronology in three major areas of scientific innovation that would substantially improve precision, accuracy, and turn-around time for sample processing and sediment dating.  The establishment of a customer relations management accessible library of physical data, photoluminescence properties, geochronology, and geolocation of quartz and feldspar sediments yielded critical insights into sample processing methods.  This online geochronological library will help identify specific locations of previous luminescence measurements and the expected age of quartz and feldspar sediments dating ~200,000 years prior.  These new insights will help geologists and archaeologists to establish a more precise timeline of past geological and human activity by determining the last moment terrestrial and extraterrestrial sediments were exposed to sunlight.  New geographical locations of sediment collection were identified in Florida; test samples were collected from the Helen Blazes FL site and sedimentology and X-ray analysis yielded new morphological insights that will be used for rapid spectroscopic screening and tailored pretreatment of sediments based on geolocation.  A focus on instrument development for field deployable measurements allowed for an initial design prototype that focused on new photoluminescence (PL) and stimulated luminescence (SL) measurements at the Helen Blazes site, thereby increasing the potential of accuracy and efficiency of laboratory measurements. \n\nThe final outcomes of the project were focused on increasing the turn-around time for sample processing by eliminating hydrofluoric acid as a hazardous chemical processing method. The new chemical pretreatment methods established during this NSF SBIR award have the potential to increase the number of sediments sampled per project by scientists, cultural resource managers, and archeologists; specifically, the new pretreatment methods will improve quartz sediment separation from feldspar in the silt grain size range and outlined in Figure 1.

The activities performed will advance engineering and science innovation in pulsed optical/NIR dating methods with a focus on high performance instrument development for rapid sample screening of luminescence and other physical properties correlated with quartz and feldspar geochronology.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/02/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Amy M Scott"
