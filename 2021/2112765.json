 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) for the R/V Hugh R Sharp, a 146-foot Regional research vessel operated by the University of Delaware as part of the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF). Sharp is a state-of-the-art, coastal research vessel that is owned and operated by the University of Delaware. The vessel can carry fourteen to twenty scientists on cruises up to eighteen days in duration and supports projects from all disciplines of oceanography. The vessel is a regional asset, serving researchers from many institutions throughout the mid-Atlantic. The vessel typically operates in the coastal waters from Long Island, New York, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as well as the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. In 2020, in a pandemic-shortened season, Sharp completed only 35 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 8 days or 25% of the sailing schedule. In 2021, Sharp is scheduled for 143 days with NSF days accounting for 7% (10 days) of the total sailing schedule. SSSE requested in this proposal includes:\r\n\r\nFuruno Navigation RADARs (Set of 2)\t$88,600\t\r\nGMDSS Emergency Communications Equipment\t$16,885\t\r\n\t\t\t\t$105,485\t\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award funded replacement of the R/V HUGH R SHARP's 16-year-old navigation RADARs and some regulatory (GMDSS - Global Maritime Distress and Safety System) communications equipment that was at end of service life.  Funds were also used to perform maintenance and purchase a new housing for one of the ship's gyrocompasses.\n\nThe project was completed within the planned budget.  All systems are working as expected.  The systems were installed over the winter and did not interfere with the ship's operational schedule.  The replaced RADARs were will maintained and served the ship well, however were beyond service life and risk of a failure at sea that impacted safety of navigation or completion of a science mission was high.\n\nThe new RADARs will provide a safer operational environment for the vessel, crew, and science teams, and greatly reduce risk of a major component failure  during a science mission that could impact safety or the continuation of missions.  Expected service life is 10 years or more.\n\nThe SHARP is a state of the art research platform owned and operated by the University of Delaware.  The vessel entered service in 2006 and is a member of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) Academic Research Fleet.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jon Swallow"
