 "awd_abstract_narration": "Walk-in environmental rooms that provide precision control of temperature, relative humidity, and light have a great many applications in research and education.  The twin 1980s-era environmental control chambers at Highlands Biological Station (HBS: highlandsbiological.org) have been real work-horses, supporting hundreds of studies on plants and animals over the years in many research areas, from behavior, ecology, and climate change to development, genetics, and physiology \u2014 especially work with lungless salamanders, one of the most ecologically important animal groups in southern Appalachian forests and streams.  In addition to research, these chambers have also supported class demonstrations and student research projects in HBS field courses.  The chambers are now very dated, however, with aging plumbing, wiring, and analog controls that no longer function reliably, hampering research and other applications.  This project will replace and upgrade the functionality of these chambers while also expanding capacity, adding a third walk-in environmental control room.  The goal is both expanded capabilities and expanded capacity in order to support a broader range of applications in research, teaching, class projects, public programs, and demonstrations.  \r\n\r\nWorking with leaders in the design and construction of precision scientific and industrial environmental control rooms, this project entails fabricating and installing 3 new chambers on the footprint of the old ones. The design realizes a net gain of over 16 square feet of working area and 215 cubic feet of conditioned space, reliably providing the precision temperature, relative humidity, light control and other capabilities needed by today's researchers and for instructional applications.  The replacement chambers will also feature increased shelf space with interior electrical outlets to accommodate peripheral equipment such as video or grow lights, as well as remote-monitoring functionality so that HBS staff, researchers, and instructors can monitor chamber conditions via mobile device or desktop on a continuous basis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This region of especially rich biological diversity, thanks to rugged topography, high rainfall, and extensive forests, is an outstanding \"natural classroom and laboratory\" for a wide variety of scientific studies, courses, and programs on regional flora and fauna historically with a special research focus on lungless (plethodontid) salamanders, an ancient and highly biodiverse group that is the dominant vertebrate predator by biomass in southern Appalachian ecosystems. \n\n\nSupporting such work requires excellent facilities, from HBS research and teaching laboratories and classrooms to our community-facing natural history museum and high-elevation native plant botanical garden. This project enabled us to dramatically improve the single most important piece of equipment housed in the most important laboratory at HBS, the Coker Laboratory, namely replacing a pair of obsolete and failing walk-in environmental chambers with 3 state-of-the-art walk-in units that allow precision control of temperature, humidity, and light. The old units were workhorses of the field station, heavily used for research and teaching since their installation in the 1980s. The new chambers did not simply restore capacity that was lost, but with a third unit and new features they considerably expanded capacity for research, teaching, and training at HBS.\n\n\nOver the course of this project the obsolete chamber units were properly dismantled and relevant parts recycled, after which the electrical infrastructure of the laboratory building was upgraded to handle the necessary capacity for the new chambers. The new units, custom designed to fit the laboratory space and operate within the desired parameters, were assembled on site by a team of technicians and others representing a collaboration between the manufacturer, university facilities personnel, electrical engineers, local electricians, and the North Carolina State Construction Office.\n\n\nThe new chambers represent a two-fold improvement: expanded equipment capacity and functionality, which will open the door to new research, teaching, STEM training, and public engagement opportunities at HBS.
