 "awd_abstract_narration": "Airborne spread of viral diseases is recognized as an important mode of transmission. Many aspects of this transmission, including the ejection, evaporation, and dispersion of virus-laden droplets by human expiratory events within indoor spaces, have been studied. However, a science-based framework that can quickly and reliably predict the spread of airborne contagion in indoor spaces needs to be developed. Such a framework would help to assess the risk of contagion in classrooms, restaurants, elevators, aircraft cabins, etc. and to inform policy makers. This knowledge would form a science-based foundation for building a reliable and user-friendly prediction tools that can be used by researchers, policy makers, administrators, and the general public to make informed decisions about the risks of viral contagion in indoor spaces.\r\n\r\nThere are many important parameters that influence the spread of airborne contagion, and the inherently nonlinear nature of the problem makes simple predictions impossible. A multiscale, data-driven framework for the rapid and accurate prediction of airborne contagion spread in confined spaces will be developed in this project. There are two key innovations in the development of this framework.  The first involves separating the overall problem into the key components of virus-scale, source-scale (breathing, talking, coughing, or sneezing), and room-scale components.  The second consists of inverting the problem by first generating a large database of particle dispersion information before addressing the individual scenarios of contagion. These two innovations allow a few high-fidelity simulations to explore countless scenarios of indoor virus transmission without the need for separate, computationally intensive predictions of each individual scenario. This framework, along with the ability to rapidly obtain flow information within indoor spaces, will offer an unprecedented predictive capability. The framework will also evaluate uncertainties associated with the prediction by accounting for the stochastic nature of the ejection and the turbulent nature of the flow. Improvements to this framework and tool should extend their applicability to other airborne infectious diseases as well as to indoor air quality. The data-driven framework can be further extended to address the risk of contagion in outdoor spaces and can be tailored to address other problems involving particulate dispersion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "A new viral dispersalmodel has been developed to study the effect of ventilation flow rate in indorr setting. This study utilizes RANS and LES simulations along with experimental results to allow us to rapidly investigate viral and pollutant spreading in indoor scenarios. We introduced the concept of stochastic overloading to make such predictions possible. For example, with the tool we were able to judge scenarios in which indoor ventilation could produce a higher risk of transmission for a wide range of room and ventilation system configurations.Wecollaborated with air-conditioning industry toperformmultiple experiments in their experimental chamber to validate the observations of our modelregarding the effect of ventilation rate on short term occupancy.Simulations and analysiswere performed to judge the effect of the presence of internal heat sources on pollutant dispersal.We leveraged our existing LES and RANS simulations to update the statistical framework to account for the variations in aerosol dispersal due to the turbulent fluctuations and inhomogeneities associated with flow in ventilated indoor spaces. This would allow us to describe higher order statistical variables like variance to accurately capture the stochastic nature of indoor aerosol dispersal.\nWe have exploted our new model to develop best practice recommendations when it comes to seating multiple occupants for a specified occupation time in a ventilated indoor space, so as to minimize the risk of disease propagation.We are currently working on providing a scientific representation of the decisions taken for our statistical framework and preconditions for our simulations to allow for accurate replication of the same for problems that demand similar analyses.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SivaramakrishnaBalachandar\n"
