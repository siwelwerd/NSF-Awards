 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to South Dakota State University (SDSU) Functional Genomics Core Facility (FGCF) to acquire and implement an Octet RED96 BioLayer Interferometry Instrument (BII). This BII will enable researchers and students from throughout the state of South Dakota (SD) to study biomolecular interaction rates (i.e. kinetics), including DNA-protein, protein-protein, and protein-small molecule interactions across a variety of biological system involving existing and future research projects. The kinetics of these molecular interactions are the basis for all biological processes, and so quantifying these interactions is critical for the growth of bioscience research in SD. Understanding the associated technologies will promote professional development of existing and future scientists within most biological disciplines. The mission of the FGCF is to facilitate interdisciplinary gene function research and training in viral, bacterial, plant and animal systems by providing researchers and educators with access to and train for cutting-edge molecular technologies. The capabilities provided by a BII system is not currently available in the FGCF but are needed by the users of this facility. As a component of the FGCF, the Octet BII will immediately enhance the collective research efforts from at least three SD universities involving 15 investigators, 34 graduate students, 28 undergraduate students, and 6 postdoctoral associates and visiting scientists. These research efforts are primarily focused on improving human and animal health and minimizing the environmental impact of crop production. Teachers from the SD institutions have also committed to incorporating BII technologies into several graduate and undergraduate courses. The FGCF will be responsible for also promoting the utilization of these technologies into various SD research programs within all colleges, universities and emerging companies within the region. This instrument will also allow BII technologies to be incorporated into ongoing outreach programs, such as high-school teacher workshops, training programs for Native American students through the SDSU Wokini Initiative and summer undergraduate research experiences through REU programs.\r\n\r\nThere are a wide variety of projects ready to use this instrument with studies ranging from nitrogen fixation in cyanobacteria, to the symbiotic microbe relationships in agricultural plants, to the optimizing functional components within mammalian immune systems, and various virus-receptor specific interactions. This instrument will enhance strengths among emerging research entities (e.g. the Biochemical Spatiotemporal NeTwork Resource (BioSNTR) and 2D material Biofilm Engineering Science and Technology (2DBEST) research centers established to investigate the sophisticated molecular circuits involved in cell signaling using advanced imaging and molecular biology technologies) by adding a workflow to quantitative measure and kinetically characterize biomolecular interactions in various living systems. The BioSNTR was the focus of a previous a NSF EPSCOR RII program entitled \u201cThe 2020 Vision: Building Research, Education, and Innovation Partnerships for South Dakota\", but it's activities are ongoing through new projects that will be facilitated by this instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nAcquisition of an Octet RED96 BioLayer Interferometry Instrument for Multidisciplinary Molecular Interaction Research and Training: Outcome Report\r\n\n\nThe binding kinetics of molecules have significant impacts on a host of biological processes including antibody-antigen interactions, binding of transcription factors to DNA, viral binding of cellular proteins, and drug binding to targets. Accurate measurements of these binding kinetics can be challenging. This award facilitated the acquisition of cutting-edge instrumentation to measure biochemical parameters for association and dissociation of molecules. This instrument significantly improved research infrastructure at South Dakota State University and supported research in several areas. The broader goals for this award were to enhance the educational and training infrastructure within South Dakota State University for both undergraduates and graduate students spanning both biological and material science fields. This included incorporation of the Octet instrument into educational modules spanning undergraduate and graduate courses.\r\n\n\nDespite several challenges across the award period, including the cancellation of the graduate course that was going to be the primary vehicle to disseminate the Octet through graduate education, reagent costs hindering implementation in undergraduate courses with large student enrollments, and faculty turnover involving loss of the initial major users associated with the award, we were able to adapt and achieve several goals. This included workshops focused on the Octet which provided information and training for graduate students, faculty, and potential external users of the instrument. We also provided multiple tours of the facility and instrument for individual labs, new faculty members, NSF REU students, and other key stakeholders across the award. The instrument also supported research for graduate students.\r\n\n\nAn unanticipated outcome of the award was the catalyst for further improvements into core facility structure and organization at SDSU, including implementation of a new reservation system and increased visibility for the core facility. With these improvements we are anticipating increased future usage and publications using the equipment beyond the end of the award. \r\n\n\nWe would like to thank NSF for the support of research infrastructure at South Dakota State University.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RyanLHanson\n"
