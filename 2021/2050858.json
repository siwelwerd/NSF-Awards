 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS) will host a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site. The REU Site will support nine students during a twelve week, Fall-semester research program from 2021-2023. BIOS will offer a hands-on experience for undergraduates focused on the \"process of science\" rather than on specific topics within science. Students will conduct team-based research projects and will participate in a weekly seminar series, join BIOS scientists aboard the R/V Atlantic Explorer, and visit local sites of ecological interest.\r\n\r\nBIOS will introduce nine undergraduate students per year to the techniques, skills and intellectual processes required to conduct collaborative research in the marine sciences over the course of a research-intensive program. BIOS is uniquely situated in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, allowing students the opportunity to study the open ocean in conjunction with established oceanographic timeseries programs, or the near-shore environment of one of the most northerly coral reef systems in the world. In addition to an immersive, experiential introduction to scientific research, the BIOS REU program is designed to provide professional development of both students and mentors. Participants receive training in the practice of research, including extensive practice in scientific communication, as well as skills for advanced graduate study and career development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
