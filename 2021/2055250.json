 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need for a highly skilled cybersecurity and IT workforce is well documented and unequivocal. \u201cDemand for security skills, once limited primarily to government and the defense industry, has spread throughout the economy\u201d (Burning Glass, 2019). \u201cJob growth is predicted to continue to outpace the number of available qualified workforce\u201d (CyberSeek.org, 2020). Community and Technical Colleges respond to this need through their education of the skilled technical workforce. This project aims to strengthen and grow a specific component of that workforce, namely the nation\u2019s cybersecurity/computing professionals. The project\u2019s approach is to work to increase the quality of the requests for external support that these institutions seek to improve cybersecurity education at their campuses. Towards this end the project investigators plan to attract a diversity of community and technical college teams, composed of faculty, grant writers, and selected administrators and staff and provide team-based professional development designed to increase the competitiveness and innovativeness of each teams\u2019 proposed efforts in support of the education of the cybersecurity/computing skilled technical workforce.\r\n \r\nIn each year, up to twelve community and technical college teams of two faculty members and a grant writer will be accepted through an application process to participate in this team-based professional development and mentoring program. Each team will be carefully matched with and supported by a seasoned mentor who has been trained through a series of coaching sessions by the leadership team.  Essential elements of the program, including mentor training, pre-workshop mentee preparation, a multi-day workshop, and post-workshop webinars coupled with team mentoring throughout the entire process, are designed to help participants crystalize their innovative ideas and develop competitive proposals for external support. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As of October 2024, 30 of these mentee colleges (79%) have submitted a proposal to the ATE competition. Fifty-three percent (53%) of the mentee teams from cohorts one and two were awarded on their first or second attempt (award announcements for two of cohort two's colleges and 11 of cohort three's colleges are pending as of this report).The long-lasting societal impact on the cybersecurity workforce cannot be fully known, but projected as making a positive difference for students and employers for many years to come.\r\n\n\nCo-PIs Drs. Barbara Belon and Elizabeth K.

Dr. Barbara Belon, a project Co-PI and certified International Coaching Federation (ICF) coach, developed and conducted the coaching training program for the FORCCE-ATE mentors.

An unexpected and positive outcome of this collaboration was a win-win situation for both observing evaluators and the mentee teams. Some of the mentee teams were able to select a project evaluator by the end of the three-day workshop.\r\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence Training for mentor-coaches and mentee teams\nIn accordance with the December 14, 2023 NSF Notice to research community: Use of generative artificial intelligence technology in the NSF merit review process (https://new.nsf.gov/news/notice-to-the-research-community-on-ai), the FORCCE leadership team developed a statement on how Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) was used in the development of an ATE grant proposal.
