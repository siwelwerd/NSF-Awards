 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). \r\n\r\nThis dissertation research investigates the roles of boundary spanners in Arctic co-production of knowledge (CPK) projects. Boundary spanners are those who facilitate knowledge exchanges and co-production between researchers and stakeholders. This research aims to identify the characteristics of successful boundary spanners and document the process of boundary spanning through collaborative work with fifteen research partners. Partners are both Indigenous and non-Indigenous from across Alaska; they will participate in a two-day workshop to develop a conceptual model of boundary-spanning. \r\n\r\nThis dissertation project employs a co-production of knowledge framework, prioritizing research equity within an Alaska Native context. Anticipated broader impacts include contributions to the social science of boundary spanning and relational research methods. Research results will be disseminated through completion of a doctoral dissertation, a co-produced white paper and peer-reviewed articles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
