 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will develop a novel biological glue to enhance knee cartilage healing. Injuries (e.g., sports-related) or extensive use leads to deterioration because cartilage does not heal. For repair implants, including transplants and engineered grafts, securing the implant into the damaged cartilage and ensuring its growth are critical for successful healing. The proposed project will develop an advanced adhesive with live cells and other biological additives to actively encourage integration of the implant into adjacent cartilage for accelerated healing. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will advance a biological glue to enhances cartilage healing. Specifically, this project will increase the stickiness and thickness of the glue to make its properties comparable or superior to fibrin glue, the commercially available standard. This project will: (1) explore biological additives to the active cells and molecular cartilage components already present in the biological glue and compare performance with the fibrin standard; (2) examine the biological glue\u2019s ability to secure a cartilage implant into damaged native cartilage over four weeks in a laboratory model; and (3) assess the glue durability and healing. Ultimately, it is anticipated that the glue developed in this project will promote the fixation and integration of cartilage implants into native cartilage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
