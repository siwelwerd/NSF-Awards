 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a non-invasive technique using a nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry device to provide medical, health, and fitness professionals with instant feedback on the metabolic health of their clients. This feedback enables regular assessment of the effectiveness of recommended nutrition and/or exercise regimens.  By obtaining and using the NMR relaxometry data, individuals may have a way to visualize and understand if and how their new regimens  result in changes to their metabolism.  Using this feedback, individuals can positively impact their overall well-being and have options to make informed decisions about their lifestyle habits. The technology provides end-users with a method that measures metabolic health quickly and painlessly, without a blood sample.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project develops a non-invasive, compact nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) time domain technology to measure the fluidity of fatty acids in adipose tissue in a person's finger.  The device uses low-field permanent magnets in a table-top device and measures parameters using NMR relaxometry to predominately measure the triglyceride-rich intracellular oil droplets.  The fluidity of lipids and lipoproteins in tissues is an important parameter in understanding physical properties and biological functions.  This technology quantifies adipose tissue parameters that reflect the ratio of cis-unsaturated to saturated and trans-fats in the tissue.  Population studies indicate higher intake of cis-unsaturated fatty acids is associated with better health outcomes and decreased risk for coronary heart disease.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
