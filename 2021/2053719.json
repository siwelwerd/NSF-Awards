 "awd_abstract_narration": "Like many species of small pelagic marine fish, recruitment and productivity of Northern Anchovy fluctuate by orders of magnitude among years. When abundant, the anchovy support a wide range of marine species, including marine mammals, seabirds and a diverse group of marine fishes. Anchovy, which previously thrived during periods of cool-water temperatures and strong coastal upwelling, are currently booming with abundances far in excess of any historical record, even though the California Current Ecosystem is experiencing an unprecedented marine heat wave. This unexpected occurrence challenges the most basic understanding of the mechanisms driving population dynamics in the species.  This project is investigating the effects of trophic relationships on population productivity by capitalizing on the immediate research opportunity afforded by the novel, yet ephemeral, state of a local marine heat wave. Findings from the work are being used to develop a mechanistic model of coastal pelagic fish population dynamics generally, and anchovy dynamics in particular. Funded field and lab work are supporting opportunities for undergraduate training and research, and are generating open-access data that serve the research and teaching/training communities into the future.\r\n\r\nThis RAPID project augments the scheduled Fall research cruises jointly run by the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation and the California Current Ecosystem Long-Term Ecological Research programs. Together, these programs conduct regional oceanographic surveys that include anchovy spawning grounds and larval nursery areas. The RAPID-augmented sampling is designed to test the emerging hypothesis that anchovy populations are trophodynamically mediated at the larval stage, whereby high recruitment results from increased trophic transfer efficiency from the base of the food web. Larval diets and prey selection analyses are being paired with amino acid compound-specific isotope analysis (\u03b415N) of the larvae and prey field to generate detailed information on larval trophic ecology. Larval diets and plankton community structure are being related to available data on upwelling and productivity to assess environmental and biological drivers to trophic transfer efficiency. Collectively, these analyses are revealing how food chain length is regulated at the larval level through prey selection, at the prey level through community composition, and at the base of the food chain via coastal upwelling and primary production. Furthermore, this project is establishing whether the current trophic level of anchovy larvae is equal to that of historic population booms and if this is the result of favorable feeding conditions throughout their habitat.  Findings from the study are generating a mechanistic understanding of the trophic underpinnings of small pelagic fish population productivity in coastal upwelling systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
