 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the acquisition and installation of a next generation Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) Magnetometer system at Wayne State University, which enables multi-disciplinary research and education efforts in Detroit and Southeastern Michigan.  The SQUID magnetometer measures magnetic properties of samples over a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields.  The capability to measure many sample shapes, e.g. films, crystals, and powders, allows researchers from Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, and Physiology to all engage with the new instrument.  Undergraduate and graduate students from these departments are individually trained on the SQUID magnetometer.  At least 20 graduate research students use the tool regularly, giving students in Detroit and Southeastern Michigan direct experience with a cutting-edge tool in magnetism research.  The new SQUID magnetometer is integrated into an existing Materials and Device Characterization course as well as complements a suite of instruments focused on characterizing advanced materials.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition and installation of a latest-generation SQUID magnetometer system Wayne State University enables researchers in Detroit, southeast Michigan and beyond to engage in advanced magnetic materials and systems research. This magnetic property measurement system is cryogen-free, can operate in a temperature range between 3 and 1000 K, and apply magnetic fields up to 7 Tesla.  Using the vibrating scanning magnetometry option, minute magnetic moments can be sensed.  The instrument has additional options such as a horizontal rotator and electrical transport probe to study magnetic anisotropies and magneto-transport properties of various samples.  The system supports research projects in the areas of antiferromagnetic spintronics, magnetic refrigeration, and the development of new rare-earth free hard magnets.  The acquisition of the SQUID magnetometer also enables new collaborative efforts between researchers combining expertise in antiferromagnetism and van der Waals materials.  In particular, the investigators use the SQUID magnetometer to work on systems where magnetic anisotropies and interactions are controlled by twist angles between adjacent layers in two-dimensional materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
