 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current networking capacity at McMurdo Station is insufficient to even be considered \u201cbroadband,\u201d with a summer population of up to 1000 people sharing what is equivalent to the connection enjoyed by a typical family of three in the United States. The changing Antarctic ice sheets and Southern Ocean are large, complex systems that require cutting edge technology to do cutting edge research, with remote technology becoming increasingly useful and even necessary to monitor changes at sufficient spatial and temporal scales. Antarctic science also often involves large data-transfer needs not currently met by existing satellite communication infrastructure. This workshop will gather representatives from across Antarctic science disciplines\u2014from astronomy to zoology\u2014as well as research and education networking experts to explore the scientific advances that would be enabled through dramatically increased real-time network connectivity, and also consider opportunities for subsea cable instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will assess the importance of a subsea fiber optic cable for high-capacity real-time connectivity in the US Antarctic Program, which is at the forefront of some of the greatest climate-related challenges facing our planet. The workshop will: (1) document unmet or poorly met current scientific and logistic needs for connectivity; (2) explore connectivity needs for planned future research and note the scientific advances that would be possible if the full value of modern cyberinfrastructure-empowered research could be brought to the Antarctic research community; and (3) identify scientific opportunities in planning a fully instrumented communication cable as a scientific observatory. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the workshop will be hosted and streamed online. While the workshop will be limited to invited personnel in order to facilitate a collaborative working environment, broad community input will be sought via survey and via comment on draft outputs. A workshop summary document and report will be delivered to NSF. Increasing US Antarctic connectivity by orders of magnitude will be transformative for science and logistics, and it may well usher in a new era of Antarctic science that is more accessible, efficient and sustainable.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The workshop addressed questions around the value and feasibility of deploying a new optical fiber submarine cable system that would supply high-speed internet connectivity to McMurdo Station to address the severe network bandwidth bottlenecks that currently constrain scientific research in Antarctica. Such a cable could also be instrumented, becoming a scientific observatory crossing a poorly-sampled yet critical transect of the Southern Ocean (by incorporating Scientific Monitoring And Reliable Telecommunications, or SMART sensors into the cable).</p>\n<p>After the workshop was held from June 29, 2021 to July 1, 2021, the project team incorporated workshop outcomes into a final report summarizing the scientific value of a potential subsea fiber-optic cable between New Zealand/Australia and McMurdo Station, Antarctica. The final report was delivered to the National Science Foundation on October 1, 2021.</p>\n<p>This effort brought together early-career polar science and science communication leaders (PI Peter Neff, co-PI Heidi Roop, postdoc Kristin Timm, and PhD student Julia Andreasen) with leaders of the University of Hawaii (president David Lassner, CTO Garret Yoshimi, and director of cyberinfrastructure Gwen Jacobs). This team reached a wide community of interested parties, from multidisciplinary polar scientists to subsea cable experts and global research and education networking leaders. This brought workshop attendance or engagement from 138 individuals, whose contributions were captured both during the workshop and in a survey distributed to interested parties prior to the workshop (the results of which are incorporated into the final project report).</p>\n<p>The workshop found that:</p>\n<p>Finding 1: Existing and future Antarctic research would be significantly enhanced if bandwidth limitations were eliminated through the availability of a modern submarine cable system.</p>\n<p>Finding 2: A new submarine cable could be constructed with embedded instrumentation (a SMART cable) that would itself enable meaningful new research and understanding of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica.</p>\n<p>Finding 3: Robust bandwidth for interpersonal connectivity for scientists and staff, if thoughtfully approached, could be transformative for research and work functions, participation in Antarctic science, education, engagement, and community wellbeing.</p>\n<p>Finding 4: Construction of a new SMART cable that provides essentially unlimited bandwidth to McMurdo is feasible and could also serve as the platform to extend connectivity to deep-field research sites as well as critical research programs at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. This level of connectivity can transform the science and research platforms for future generations.</p>\n<p>Overall, there was substantial community enthusiasm for such a project, some issues identified for further review and research, and in general, a willingness expressed by many participants to continue engaging with NSF should the project proceed.</p>\n<p>In addition to the final workshop report, which is publicly available via the US Antarctic Program Data Center and also via the Polar Geospatial Center website, the workshop was covered by the popular press (<em>E&amp;E News, The Verge, Scientific American</em>) and PI Neff shared about outcomes at the April <em>2022 International Cable Protection Committee Virtual Plenary. </em>Recordings of the workshop itself are available on YouTube, hosted by the Polar Geospatial Center. The workshop final report provided motivation for NSF to conduct an engineering feasibility study of constructing a subsea fiber cable to McMurdo Station, Antarctica. In the course of completing this work PI Neff became engaged in trialing additional communications technology to increase connectivity in the Antarctica, working with SpaceX to provide an initial test of Starlink in an Antarctic field camp (COLDEX Allan Hills ice coring, 2022-23 Antarctic season).
