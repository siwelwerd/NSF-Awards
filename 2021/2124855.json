This workshop will enhance the capacity of the learning sciences as a field to address important challenges associated with the transformation of education and broadening of participation in the digital age. Additionally, the workshop will target diverse participants within the field and mentor scholars who are underrepresented. The overall goal is to support new scholars in the interdisciplinary learning science research community and contribute to impactful research on learning that will benefit society as a whole.\r\n\r\nGiven the virtual setting due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the project will employ new technologies to create virtual-based opportunities for community building and networking for the participants.  The workshop organization builds on a successful model documented as effective in similar past workshops, providing opportunities for the participants to interact with international researchers and practitioners. The activities provide participants with a deeper understanding of the field combined with hands-on mentorship. This will support early career scholars to succeed in the field and go on to make valuable intellectual contributions. Ultimately, the workshop will enhance the capacity of the learning sciences as an interdisciplinary field to address important challenges associated with the transformation of education and broadening of participation in the digital age.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The Learning Sciences is an interdisciplinary with the goal of&nbsp;advancing knowledge and application of knowledge about human learning and&nbsp;development in a variety of educational settings. The intent of learning science research is to develop evidence-based claims about how people learn that have theoretical, practical, and pedagogical&nbsp;implications.&nbsp;With this proposal, we sought NSF funding for conference registration, technological, and mentoring support for a group of 25 US-based researchers (10 for the DC workshop, 10 for the ECW, and 5 for MCW) to attend the ISLS 2021 DC, ECW, and MCW virtually. These workshops&nbsp;provide participants with a deeper understanding of the field combined with hands-on mentorship. In doing so, we position early career scholars to succeed in the field and go on to make valuable intellectual contributions.&nbsp;We also used funds to pay for&nbsp;an&nbsp;online&nbsp;technology, called Gather that could&nbsp;create opportunities for community building and networking for our participants; something previous online participants reported as lacking in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the workshops, participants attended mentoring sessions, a \"meet the editor\" session where they met editors of our most prominent journals, a grant writing session with representatives from US-based NSF and NIH programs and European based programs; Q&amp;A mentor panel where they could seek advice from prominent senior members of the field, and speed matching research sessions to pair them with peers so they could plan future conferences, workshops, or papers. For doctoral students, we held one-on-one sessions where they could get feedback on their dissertations. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also held special online events using Gather: a virtual poster session where participants could promote their work and a large social event where participants&nbsp;could meet scholars informally, during fun events like a virtual dance club or meditation room, gardens, etc.&nbsp;The main goal of the online events was to promote the work of early and mid-career scholars and create opportunities for networking with prominent scholars in the field. To accomplish these aims, we worked with the Gather company to create spaces to benefit participants directly. For example, we created a place for them to present their work that simulated a large poster presentation hall (see figure 1). These presentations were well attended by the community. People would drop by and have conversations with the participants; people would go into the presenter&rsquo;s space and once inside their space, their video would come on so that those folks could see each other and talk to each more naturally (see Figure 2). We also created gardens, dining halls, and other sites that resembled real-world spaces of the host university. Participants would meet at these &ldquo;spaces&rdquo; and eat lunch together or meet up for conversations (see Figure 3).</p>\n<p>Overall, participants rated the workshops highly, stating they contributed to increasing knowledge about the field and making new connections. Participants also stated that the funding was critical to their being able to attend. Three groups of participants, formed at the workshop, also successfully proposed symposia, paper, or panels for the ISLS 2022 and 2023 conference.&nbsp;Regarding the technology, participants appreciated Gather and discussed stated the technology helped to make the distributed nature of the conference feel less isolating. However, within the society there remain mixed feeling about online meetings that have yet to be resolved. Some argue that in-person meetings are expensive and place many constraints on diverse participants, especially those with less funding. However, scholars of color raised the concern that in-person meetings provide them with opportunities to meet and bond with members of the society in ways that virtual conferences just do not, even with the use of technologies like Gather. Both female and male participants with familial responsibilities added that virtual conferences are not as engaging or feasible for them because they are forced to engage in the conference while simultaneously taking care of children. What is more, conference organizers point out that to run a virtual conference well, in ways that help online participants feel connected and included, requires a great deal of added personnel time and financial resources that we do not currently have. Thus, meeting the needs of economically, familially, and racially, diverse participants is a challenge. So, our society has identified these concerns as important issues to consider carefully as we move forward.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/31/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Marcela&nbsp;Borge</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2124855/2124855_10733654_1690824590207_Figures--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2124855/2124855_10733654_1690824590207_Figures--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Screenshots of Gather Spaces\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2124855/2124855_10733654_1690824590207_Figures--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshots of Gather Spaces\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figures 1-2 show the poster hall we created for participants promote their work and build new social networks</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">MBorge screenshot</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marcela&nbsp;Borge</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Screenshots of Gather Spaces</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2124855/2124855_10733654_1690824701522_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2124855/2124855_10733654_1690824701522_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Example of a Gather space\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2124855/2124855_10733654_1690824701522_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Example of a Gather space\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screen shot of an informal meeting space in Gather</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mborge</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marcela&nbsp;Borge</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Example of a Gather space</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
