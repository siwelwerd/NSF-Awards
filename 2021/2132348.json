 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of all-solid-state batteries, where a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) and electrical components are 3D-printed. The proposed technology is designed to eliminate the fire and explosion hazards associated with current liquid electrolyte lithium (Li)-ion batteries. In addition, the use of 3D printing may free product designers to move away from current solid geometrical shapes, e.g., cylinders, discs, and flat plates, to practical, three-dimensional, flexible shapes that are favored by consumer demand.  This flexibility means a high degree of design freedom. The proposed technology may enable the use of 3D printable battery manufacturing technology to make high-performance flexible structures with improved dimensional accuracy and safety, enabled by the unique material capabilities of ionic polymers and multi-material conformal 3D printing. Dimensional accuracy and safety may also allow product designers to develop compact products with integrated batteries that lower developmental costs with fewer design constraints. Currently, solid-state batteries require expensive custom molds that increase unit production costs. The proposed technology may lower costs by 3D printing the battery components enabling the fine-tuning of material properties while adding design flexibility to specific custom battery applications. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a 3D printing technology for solid polymer electrolytes on a freeform surface using ionic compounds and polymers. Current battery technologies calls for the use of volatile organic liquid electrolytes that present a problem due to the low flashpoints of the solvents. This safety issue may be overcome using solid polymer printing with properties that are flame retardant, lightweight, and exhibit high ionic conductivity. Preliminary research has shown that the mechanical properties may be tuned to meet precise customer specifications where base formulations consist of a photocrosslinkable monomer, lithium salt, and plasticizer. In addition, previous research has shown that conformal 3D printing, 3D printing on a freeform surface, may enable a 3D structure to be built on virtually any surface. The combination of conformal 3D printing and solid polymer electrolytes offers a unique opportunity for developing a 3D customizable battery of practically any three dimensional shape. Future research will focus on increasing ionic conductivity (with higher surface areas) as well as proving that conformal printing may be used to print batteries on existing product surfaces.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
