 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The University of California Los Angeles is acquiring a continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) spectrometer to support research of Professor Paula Diaconescu and colleagues Greg Carman, Miguel Garcia-Garibay, Sarah Tolbert and Chong Liu. This instrument allows research in a variety of fields such as those that provide insight on how biologically relevant species with unpaired electrons behave. In general, an EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid-state materials. It is also used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of possible pathological growth. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution as well as collaborators from regional institutions such as those in the Cal State System as well as nearby minority serving institutions.\r\n\r\nThe award of the EPR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts the characterization of pre-catalysts with unpaired electrons, mixed valence metal complexes, and paramagnetic lanthanide complexes used to prepare optically active molecular spin qubits and the study of rotational dynamics of different magnetic organic frameworks with stable nitroxyl radicals. The instrumentation is also used to search for materials for multiferroic antennas and for the rapid screening of magnetic loss in new dynamic magnetoelastic materials. In addition, it allows the characterization of doped semiconducting polymers and studies of boron-based stable radical species. The instrument also serves researchers designing rules and understanding the effect of 3-dimensional aromatic radicals on how their electronic properties can be rationally tuned and deliberately manipulated and to understand catalytic methane air oxidation to methanol by reactive oxygen.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
