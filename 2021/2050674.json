 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site award to Arizona State University, located in Tempe, Arizona, supports 8 students for 10 weeks of research and professional development during the summers of 2022-2024. In this program, supported by the Division of Chemistry, participants will have the opportunity to design and apply 'green chemistry' transformations in the fields of organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, and biochemistry. The participants will be introduced to leading practices in sustainable chemistry and catalysis, take part in professional development workshops to enhance graduate school and industrial career preparedness. REU students at this site will have the opportunity to network with scientists pursuing a variety of career paths. This project aims to broaden STEM participation by encouraging students to consider how chemical research can lead to positive environmental outcomes. \r\n\r\nIn this REU program, students will participate in individual research projects that focus on sustainable chemistry. Topics include the development of new base metal catalysts for coupling and C-H functionalization reactions; the computational screening of environmentally friendly solvents; the use of enzymes for hydrogen evolution and halogenation catalysis; and the development of sustainable methods for the preparation of inorganic materials. Notably, these projects will be explored within shared laboratory space, allowing for team-based mentoring and collaboration. Workshops on sustainable chemistry research, scientific writing, presentation skills, and networking will be offered alongside team-building activities. Project mentors will maintain contact with students through virtual meetings and seminars following conclusion of the program. To increase diversity within the chemistry workforce, this site also aims to recruit underrepresented students from local community colleges and tribal colleges throughout the Southwestern United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
