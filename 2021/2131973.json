 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a device for the treatment of patients with lymphedema.  According to the World Health Organization, lymphedema affects over 250 million people worldwide while 5-10 million Americans suffer from chronic lymphedema.  Secondary lymphedema is most common and often occurs after cancer surgery and/or after receiving radiation therapy. Upper extremity lymphedema occurs in up to 40% of breast cancer survivors and lower extremity lymphedema develops in up to 70% of gynecological cancer survivors and 20% of prostate cancer survivors.  The proposed technology will be designed as a wearable medical device that will stimulate lymphatic circulation and improve the soft tissue composition.  The proposed device will apply alternating pneumatic pressure to squeeze out lymph fluids and improve the function of lymphatic vessels.  The goal is to improve lymphatic flow as compared to current gold-standard treatment (i.e., compressive garment) and improve the lives of patients suffering from the debilitative effects of lymphedema.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a medical device for the treatment of patients with lymphedema by alternating negative and positive pressure gradients to stimulate lymphatic circulation. Previous research showed the underlying pathophysiology of lymphedema development and the structural alterations of the lymphatic system in patients with breast cancer.  Preliminary results of bench tests with a prototype confirmed the technical and physiological feasibility of the proposed approach. The proposed device will apply alternating pressure gradients to redirect lymphatic fluids from the interstitial tissue to the lymphatic ducts. This process will enable healthy lymphatic vessels to expand and absorb lymph fluid as compared to current compressive methods that only use pneumatic pressure to squeeze out lymph fluids. The proposed technology may enable the opening of damaged lymphatic vessels and improve the absorption of lymph fluid from lymphedema affected tissues. Moreover, this technology may improve soft tissue composition and prevent fibrosis development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
