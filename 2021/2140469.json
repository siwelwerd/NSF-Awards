 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project focuses on exploring and developing a novel operational collection of speech, language and perception-based measures to objectively assess speech intelligibility for second language (L2) speech production, as well as providing effective learner-specific feedback. With the rise of English as an international language, intelligibility-based successful communication has been emphasized over native-like accents. However, L2 teachers often raise concerns about learners\u2019 slow or stagnant pronunciation progress. Several primary reasons for this problem may include difficulties in perceptually discerning changes in learners\u2019 speech and interpreting learners\u2019 speech patterns without any learner-specific intelligibility assessment profile. Today, teachers have no systematic way to assess each student\u2019s speech changes, nor can students monitor and track feedback related to their pronunciation learning progression. Therefore, an exploratory and transformative method is introduced for measuring speech intelligibility that provides both teachers and learners with objective and individualized feedback. This  exploratory project is proposed for EAGER funding  in order to establish a baseline working framework for operational objective measure creation, and proof-of-concept assessment feedback for teachers and learners. This approach will help teachers gauge learners\u2019 intelligibility levels and allow learners to self-regulate their learning progress incrementally over time. The long-term innovation is expected to benefit skilled US professionals from non-English speaking countries, who work in various STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. Additionally, this interdisciplinary project provides various opportunities for hands-on training and experience for both graduate and undergraduate students in the fields of language education, applied linguistics, computer engineering, and speech technology.\r\n\r\nThis project explores an idea to assess intelligibility in speech communications based on multiple individual speech measures for non-native speakers. The ideas are currently in their very early stages of development, and a large portion of the research ideas are untested. In order to establish the ground truth of potential individual speech production intelligibility measures, the implementation and feasibility of this intelligibility feedback approach must be validated with evidence. By employing advanced Automatic Speech Recognition-based accent classification technology based on machine learning, the team of researchers plan to provide learners with measured speech property information through operational and a discriminating set of objective speech intelligibility measures. The current innovation builds on language skill acquisition theory with a functional analytic-linguistic approach, arguing that explicit and metalinguistic feedback plays a pivotal role in moving learners forward in their L2 development. The vision is enabled by on-going research on auditory-based neurogram and spectrogram orthogonal polynomial measures that predict speech intelligibility, employing the learners\u2019 unconstrained speech utterances. The project will contribute to the scientific knowledge of what constitutes L2 intelligible speech, understanding how individualized objective speech intelligibility feedback affects L2 speech development, and creating a foundational collection of speech/auditory/signal processing measures as well as ASR/DNN driven measures that assess a speaker\u2019s intelligibility and identify efficient ways of implementing this technology in L2 learning contexts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This collaborative project involves three institutions: Northern Arizona Univ. (NAU-lead), Univ. of Texas-Dallas (UTD), and Penn State Univ. (PSU). The collaborating teams&rsquo; (NAU, UTD, PSU) efforts were divided into three interdisciplinary foci: (1) intelligibility ratings and speech properties (linguistics, NAU; speech processing, UTD), (2) intelligibility-based instruction and feedback (learning science, PSU; feedback development, NAU), and (3) OSIM development (computer engineering, UTD) and validation (NAU). This exploratory and transformative project investigated the use of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to provide L2 learners with objective speech measures of their English intelligibility, including combining acoustic and perception measures to further understand what constitutes intelligibility, the development of automated measurement systems, and the implementation of such efforts in the tertiary language learning classroom. The project aimed to establish a baseline framework for operational objective measure creation, and proof-of-concept feedback for teachers and learners. It brought accent classification technology, repurposed for intelligibility measurement, into L2 pronunciation instruction in the form of a diagnostic and assessment framework. Traditionally, most efforts in speech detection measure native/non-native differences in speakers, striving to move accented speakers towards native-like speech production. However, the current study took a strategically alternate view by creating an inventory of measures that incorporated both native and non-native/highly intelligible accented speech production, followed by multi-dimensional weighting using Machine Learning (ML) to produce overall combined intelligibility scores. With this novel pedagogical framework, the project started with Chinese international teaching assistants (ITAs) in STEM fields in the US and expanded to other L2 speakers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The focus of NAU-lead was on examining the effectiveness of OSIM feedback on L2 learners&rsquo; intelligibility as well as the relationships between raters&rsquo; intelligibility measures and acoustic properties. Initially, 30 highly intelligible speakers were identified as 95% intelligible by 15 expert listeners with various transcription tasks. Their speech, characterized as highly intelligible but still accented, was used as baseline norms for OSIM development. Then, eleven L1 Chinese ITAs received human-listener based intelligibility feedback for two-sequential interventions, from which initial findings showed the promising patterns of learner-specific intelligibility feedback. The project advanced with 108 L2 speakers who received various combinations of OSIM feedback derived from 15 trained/expert human listeners and preliminary automated intelligibility scores. A total of 405 naturalistic audio files of spontaneous speech were elicited. They were then analyzed for acoustic properties via Praat and acoustic script analysis, including lexical stress, prominence, pause, rhythm, and articulation rate. [These datasets, called the &lsquo;L2USI&rsquo; (Second Language University Students Intelligibility&rsquo; corpus), are now publicly available through the Linguistic Data Consortium.] Major findings related to intelligibility-acoustic correlates indicate that the relationship between articulation rate and perceptual ratings of intelligibility is not linear, showing the optimal average syllables per second for intelligibility between 2.75 to 4.00. High lexical stress accuracy was associated with highly intelligible speech but severe deleterious effects were detected below 70% accuracy (See Figure 1). These findings provide scientific evidence to revamp the traditional concept of linearity in speech characteristics, which can inform the fields of linguistics, speech science, and speech engineering. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for the effects of OSIM feedback, the project involved several stages of pilot and short-term (trial) intervention approaches. In one study, 64 experimental-group L2 learners and their teachers received the OSIM feedback while 30 control-group learners did not. The OSIM group showed a statistically significant improvement (<em>p</em>&lt;.001) with a large effect size on lexical stress, pause, and articulation rate (See Figure 2). The surveys of learner perceptions and interviews with eight instructors confirmed that OSIM helped not only to improve intelligibility, but also to increase motivation. Follow-up studies derived from these results included the effects of Data Driven Learning (62 L2 learners) and AI-based feedback (90 learners) on L2 intelligibility. Their findings suggested that while OSIM should be a promising approach, both learners and teachers need specific guidance/training in understanding technology-based feedback with multi-dimensional data. In addition, they verified that leveraging speech recognition model development is complex but advantageous, especially for both individual use and classroom applications, and evidence-based state-of-the-art intelligibility measure(s) should go beyond traditional phonemic recognition. With the resulting L2 speech corpus with human perception data, the foundational speech/language technology systems, and preliminary results, this EAGER research has confirms the necessity of a comprehensive investigation to advance intelligibility-based objective speech measures as a diagnostic and formative assessment tool to provide both L2 learners and teachers with the necessary actionable baselines, frameworks, and approaches to improve L2 English learners&rsquo; speech intelligibility and support their communication for personal, educational, business, and societal engagement. Overall, the project outcomes include 16 journal articles and conferene preceedings, 34 conference and invited presentations, 3 workshops, 2 audio/video product through the Linguistic Data Consortium, 1 book chapter, 1 PhD dissertation, and 1 book proposal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 08/05/2024<br>\nModified by: Okim&nbsp;Kang</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2140469/2140469_10753400_1722889888269_Figure_2--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2140469/2140469_10753400_1722889888269_Figure_2--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2140469/2140469_10753400_1722889888269_Figure_2--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">OSIM Feedback Design and Effects</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Okim Kang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Okim&nbsp;Kang\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2140469/2140469_10753400_1722889843711_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2140469/2140469_10753400_1722889843711_Figure_1--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2140469/2140469_10753400_1722889843711_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Acoustic-Perceptual Relationships: Nonlinear relationships with perception and (a) articulation rate                    (b) lexical stress accuracy</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Okim Kang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Okim&nbsp;Kang\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
