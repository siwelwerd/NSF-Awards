 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nResearchers at Tennessee Tech University (TN Tech) are making significant upgrades to the campus computing infrastructure that will significantly improve the university researchers\u2019 and students\u2019 ability to perform, enhance, and expand their systems-oriented, algorithms-oriented, or applications-oriented research activities. This enhanced new computing infrastructure complements other investments already made, in-progress, or in-planning at TN Tech. This modern campus cluster will enable TN Tech to grow and sustain the HPC culture by expanding on its current NSF-funded CyberTraining activities to include hundreds of faculty and their undergraduate students from resource-limited institutions from across the southeast.  This new cluster will help TN Tech to build a regional resource for computational capacity and workforce development expanding opportunities to underrepresented groups in the region.\r\n\r\nThis award allows TN Tech to procure a state-of-the-art, cost-effective 10 node GPU cluster supporting 20 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, 1280 AMD Epyc2 CPU cores, and 5 TiB of main memory connected with 100 Gbit/s Infiniband.  The cluster provides capabilities not previously available on campus. This project team anticipates significant research projects in computational fluid dynamics, biomechanics, and geospatial analysis, which will engage four partner universities. Seventeen ongoing research projects including 3 teaching projects will directly benefit from the improved infrastructure. Additional research projects will be enabled over time as the PIs and the planned internal advisory committee attract additional researchers and students requiring heterogeneous HPC. The project team expects about 100 of College of Engineering Ph.D. students will use the HPC infrastructure for their research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
