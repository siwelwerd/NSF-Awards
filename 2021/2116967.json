 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation program.  The University of Scranton is acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer that has the capabilities to perform both routine analysis and more complex experiments that helps elucidate molecular structures of chemical compounds.  The instrument supports the research of Professor Michael Fennie and colleagues Arthur Catino and Nicholas Sizemore at the University of Scranton and several collaborators at other colleges and universities in the Scranton region.   Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry.  This instrument is a regional resource in the Scranton area, with users coming from local industry and high school science classes, in addition to other colleges in the region.\r\n\r\nThe award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels.  It especially impacts the development of methodologies to facilitate the structure elucidation of small and medium-sized molecules.  This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as catalysis, biophysical structural analysis, development of synthetic methodology, synthesis of both natural and synthetic products and organometallic chemistry.  In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structures of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
