 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has been a successful theory, explaining experimental observations involving weak, electromagnetic, and strong interactions over the last few decades. However, as experiments probe deeper with increasing energies, it is evident that the SM is an incomplete theory; for example, it fails to account for astronomical dark matter. This work at the CMS Experiment at the CERN LHC, seeks to explore multiple avenues to discover and characterize the nature of dark matter particles and to contribute to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) upgrade. Research and education activities will be integrated by providing international collaborative research opportunities for undergraduate students and by developing a new course that uses open-source data for the upper-division undergraduate curriculum.\r\n\r\nOne goal of this project is to explore signatures with one or more jets and an overall momentum imbalance to discover and characterize dark matter particles. In addition, the Higgs boson will be used as a tool for discovery by searching for its decay to invisible particles. Techniques to suppress the effects of additional proton-proton interactions in jet and missing transverse momentum reconstruction both at the real-time event selection (trigger) and analysis levels will also be explored to maximize the sensitivity to the dark matter searches. The High Luminosity LHC will increase the discovery potential for new particles, providing unprecedented sensitivity to dark matter processes. However, the projected 200 proton-proton interactions per bunch crossing at the LHC will pose severe challenges as the data rates in CMS will grow significantly and the readout of the sub-detectors will be very demanding. To adequately handle the challenging operating conditions and high data bandwidths, nearly all sub-detectors of the CMS experiment will be upgraded. The work will develop new readout electronics for the Inner Tracker sub-system of the CMS detector as an important element of the HL LHC upgrade.\r\n\r\nThe PI plans to establish procedures for recasting physics results and to provide a publicly available software implementation of the searches for new particles. The planned work provides an educational opportunity through experiential learning to undergraduate and graduate students who will participate in the electronics development project. In addition to direct research experience, the PI aims to integrate education and research through a redesign of the academic components of a Boston University study abroad program at CERN that encapsulates academic courses and hands-on research opportunities. The PI will also host the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics at Boston University, using it to foster dialogue with high schools through the involvement of STEP-UP Ambassadors in the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
