 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Plants produce complex arrays of chemicals in their vegetation and flowers that impact the ecology at many levels. Many plant-produced chemicals are important to human society; they can be poisonous to livestock, cause crop disease, and offer natural chemical libraries for drug discovery. While the consequences of these compounds in vegetative tissues has been extensively studied, much less is known about how specialized chemicals in pollen and nectar impact plants\u2019 interactions with pollinators and the microbes that live in flowers.  Many flowers harbor communities of beneficial and/or pathogenic fungi and bacteria that can impact pollinator behavior and health. Through a combination of genomic studies, experiments, and simulation modeling, this project will test the link between plant genomes, plant chemistry, and pollinator behavior. During their tenure the fellow will develop a standards-aligned educational unit on nectar microbes for middle-school students. They will build on previous collaborations with non-profit education partners to deliver this unit to students in Reno and Sacramento, raising public recognition of microbe\u2019s role in pollination. Given the important role of plant-microbe-pollinator interactions in natural and agricultural systems, a basic understanding of how plant chemistry shapes these interactions is particularly important.\r\n\r\nThe fellow will focus on a highly bioactive class of nectar compounds, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, produced by the naturalized non-native plant purple viper\u2019s bugloss, Echium plantagineum. The fellow will characterize the alkaloid content of the nectar and vegetation of 150 plants across three populations.  Combining the metabolite profiling with de novo genomic analysis of these plants, they will identify genetic polymorphisms that influence the alkaloids in the nectar and leaves. In the same populations the fellow will collect and isolate nectar microbes from Echium and co-flowering species. They will test whether Echium-collected microbes are better able to grow in the presence of toxic alkaloids than other nectar microbes. Finally the fellow will test how microbial growth and nectar alkaloid content interactively impact nectar consumption by bumblebees. Throughout this process the fellow will receive extensive training in microbiological and genetic techniques from the sponsoring scientists that will add to a growing skillset in pollination and behavioral ecology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This study contributes to our understanding of the intricate interactions between plants, their pollinators, and the microbes that inhabit floral environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> Plants produce a diverse array of chemicals that can significantly impact ecological interactions. While much is known about the role of these chemicals in vegetative tissues, their effects in pollen and nectar are less understood. This project focused on examining how nectar chemistry affects both pollinator behavior and the composition of microbial communities in flowers. Through a combination of field studies and laboratory experiments, we investigated the dynamics between nectar composition, pollinator visitation patterns, and microbial community assembly. Our key focus was to understand how these factors interplay to shape the ecological interactions within floral environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Host      Selection, Dispersal Processes, and Microbial Composition:</strong> We found that plants varied in their suitability for nectar microbes. When      we inoculated known communities into different plants, some individuals      grew large communities of yeasts and bacteria while others were poor      hosts. Additionally, we found that when we allowed pollinators to visit      plants, the variation in this visitation was strongly associated with the      floral microbiome. While both factors influenced floral microbiomes,      dispersal by pollinators overwhelmed the effects of host selection. This      work highlights that floral traits that influence pollinator behavior may      be key for predicting floral microbiome assembly.</li>\n<li><strong>Effects      of Nectar Bacteria on Plant Fitness:</strong> We      used artificial inoculations of nectar bacteria to show that different      species of nectar bacteria have significantly different effects on plant      fitness. Some bacteria increased seed set and seed weight, but only in      certain contexts. Others had no significant impact on plant reproduction.      This variation is crucial as it challenges the previous understanding that      a given species of microbe may act as a mutualist, commensal, or      antagonist to plants. We demonstrated that within-species variation exists      and that these effects can depend on time-varying contexts.</li>\n<li><strong>Intraspecific      Variation in Plant Chemistry:</strong> We examined the intraspecific      variation in plant chemistry in <em>Raphanus sativa</em> (wild radish). This      plant exhibits significantly different chemotypes, with some plants having      high concentrations of glucosinolates, the compounds that make mustard      \"spicy.\" We investigated how this chemical variation was      associated with floral and leaf microbiomes. These data are still being      analyzed and processed.</li>\n<li><strong>Agent-Based      Model:</strong> We built an agent-based model      to test a counterintuitive hypothesis: that microbes should produce      signals that pollinators can sense and also alter nectar in ways that are      aversive to pollinators (e.g., digesting preferred sugars or adding      distasteful metabolites). Our simulations suggested that these microbes      disperse more quickly and escape intraspecific competition. By making      nectar less attractive, these microbes increase their chances of being      carried to new flowers by pollinators, thereby enhancing their dispersal      and reducing competition within the same flower.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> Understanding the role of nectar chemistry in shaping plant-pollinator-microbe interactions has significant implications for biodiversity conservation and agriculture. This knowledge can inform strategies to enhance pollinator efficiency and plant health, which are crucial for both natural ecosystems and crop production.</p>\n<p><strong>Public Outreach:</strong> In collaboration with a regional non-profit serving the visually impaired community in Northern California, we developed a \"Sensory Ecology of Pollination\" activity. This activity focused on how plant specialized chemistry impacts the scent and taste of flowers, how these chemicals affect pollinators and microbes, and their importance to human society. This initiative raised public awareness about the role of floral chemistry in pollination and contributed to accessible STEM education. Additionally, multiple undergraduate researchers were mentored, including first-generation students and students from underrepresented minorities in STEM. We also participated in large public outreach events focusing on pollinator behavior, pollinator diversity, and floral microbiomes.</p>\n<p><strong>Postdoctoral Training:</strong> The grant provided significant postdoctoral training for PI Jacob S. Francis. He visited multiple regional and national meetings to present his findings to the scientific community. He was an author or co-author on two publications, with two more in review and multiple others in preparation. Additionally, he received extensive training in High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) chemical analysis of nectar, statistical analysis, and manuscript preparation. The grant also funded PI Francis to participate in three other collaborative projects related to pollinator nutrition and conservation. This training and collaborative experience have enhanced his research skills and contributed to his professional development as a scientist.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/01/2024<br>\nModified by: Jacob&nbsp;S&nbsp;Francis</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109460/2109460_10845796_1719835845854_CaliforniaFuchsia--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109460/2109460_10845796_1719835845854_CaliforniaFuchsia--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"California Fuchsia\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109460/2109460_10845796_1719835845854_CaliforniaFuchsia--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"California Fuchsia\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Epilobium canum flowers on the campus of UC Davis.
