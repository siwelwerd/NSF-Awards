 "awd_abstract_narration": "As sophisticated computation has become essential in more and more fields of human endeavor, interdisciplinary research has grown in importance and value. The interdisciplinary research area of computer science and law has risen to prominence in the last two years. To make progress, researchers must co-develop computational techniques and legal principles, using the strengths of each approach to compensate for weaknesses in the other. Doing this requires building shared understanding, methodology, and vocabulary to improve communication and catalyze research across the two disciplines. In November 2021, the DIMACS Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science will hold a second workshop on the topic of co-development of computer science and law, following a successful first online workshop held in November 2020. The second workshop will emphasize technology platform content moderation\u2014a topic that sits squarely at the interface of the two disciplines and must address the fundamental tension between freedom of speech and truth in media. Content moderation poses massive technological challenges arising from the sheer volume of social media content, the imperfect nature of automated moderation, and the impracticalities of manual moderation. The problem is equally daunting from a legal and constitutional perspective that must simultaneously address the rights and responsibilities of citizens, companies, organizations, law enforcement, and government.\r\n\r\nCentral to the study of computer science and law is the replacement of one-sided approaches with an emphasis on co-development. Ideally, computer scientists and lawyers should collaborate to create legislative language and technical definitions that are consistent and that capture broadly agreed-upon principles. For example, technical considerations and definitions embedded in legislation should reflect what is technically feasible and not mandate vague or impossible requirements, while implementations of such requirements should produce sufficient evidence that their behavior sits within stated requirements and thus complies with the law. Existing work on privacy, fairness, freedom of expression, community standards, and other essential social values demonstrates the importance of co-development and provides examples of both success and failure. This DIMACS workshop will continue the development of a research community in computer science and law and will have impact on a broad range of societal issues including communication among citizens. The workshop will support participation by a demographically and intellectually diverse group of researchers reflecting a broad range of interests: computer scientists, statisticians, law scholars, and social scientists studying sociotechnical assemblages and their governance. Enabling the co-development will support the creation of computing-oriented sociotechnical systems of societal importance including the online media platforms serving as the public squares of today.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The scientific program was determined by the workshop's organizing committee made up of Joan Feigenbaum (Yale), Ellen Goodman (Rutgers), David Karger (MIT) and David Pennock (DIMACS).</p>\n<p>Sophisticated computation has become essential in more and more fields of human endeavor, spawning important areas of interdisciplinary research as fields collide. The interdisciplinary research area of computer science (CS) and law -- or, more broadly, technology and law -- is one such area. It has risen to prominence over the past several years and continues to grow in both importance and complexity.</p>\n<p>To manage and regulate the impacts of computing and technology in daily life, researchers must co-develop computational techniques and legal principles, using the strengths of each approach to compensate for weaknesses in the other. Doing this requires building shared understanding, methodology, and vocabulary to improve communication and catalyze research across the two disciplines.</p>\n<p>Toward this goal, DIMACS held its first Workshop on Co-development of Computer Science and Law in November, 2020. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, that workshop was held online. This project enabled DIMACS to hold a second, primarily in-person, workshop on CS and law that emphasized technology platform content moderation: a topic that sits squarely at the interface of the two disciplines and must address the fundamental tension between freedom of speech and truth in media. Content moderation poses massive technological challenges arising from the sheer volume of social media content, the imperfect nature of automated moderation, and the impracticalities of manual moderation. The problem is equally daunting from a legal and constitutional perspective that must simultaneously address the rights and responsibilities of citizens, companies, organizations, law enforcement, and government.</p>\n<p>The workshop goals included: 1) highlighting important issues in content moderation from both legal and computational standpoints; 2) identifying promising approaches for shielding individuals from potentially dangerous content while not infringing on free speech; 3) inviting presenters representing different disciplines and viewpoints; 4) involving a large group of students and early-career researchers, including those from under-represented groups in the sciences; 5) making the event accessible despite the persistent presence of COVID; and 6) creating new resources in the form of videos from presentations.</p>\n<p>The workshop included 16 speakers from around the world, each giving a 45-minute talk on the topic of content moderation (and CS and law more broadly), including 15 minutes allocated for questions and discussion. Presentations addressed content moderation from a variety of perspectives: technical versus legal, US versus European, manual versus automated moderation, public versus platform versus community-based controls, and different types of platform users. Of the 16 speakers, half presented remotely and half are women. Several were students, postdocs, or junior faculty. Roughly half had affiliations with law schools -- three in Europe -- and half had affiliations related to CS or communication and media.</p>\n<p>Workshop presentations were recorded, and the videos are published on the DIMACS YouTube channel whenever the speaker granted permission. The workshop's webpage provides a detailed program with titles, abstracts, speaker bios, and links to the presentation videos.</p>\n<p>The workshop was fully hybrid, with both in-person and remote participants able to see and engage with each other throughout the event. In all, there were 33 in-person participants and a similar number who attended online, with many of the online participants attending for the entire event. Roughly half of the in-person attendees were students or postdocs at the time of the workshop.</p>\n<p>The format of the workshop included a poster session and substantial time allocated to discussion and questions. This format, combined with the workshop's relatively small size, fostered substantive discussion and new connections among the participants. We were told of several new collaborations that formed, and in the anonymous post-workshop survey, all of those responding said that they had made new contacts and would \"definitely\" or \"probably\" follow up with these new contacts. This is an unusually positive response to these questions. There was also considerable enthusiasm for holding future workshops in CS &amp; Law, with several people suggesting topics in the post-workshop survey.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/09/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;M&nbsp;Pennock</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2043904/2043904_10731438_1686939673596_1-DIMACS-CSLAW--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2043904/2043904_10731438_1686939673596_1-DIMACS-CSLAW--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ellen Goodman presents at the DIMACS Workshop on Co-Development of Computer Science &amp;
