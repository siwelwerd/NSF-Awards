 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in promoting insect protein as an alternative source of protein for animal feed with a considerably lower environmental footprint compared to soy and fishmeal. With over 40% of food produced in the U.S today wasted and a potential $162 billion in annual loss related to waste, the proposed technology leverages the bioconversion potential of the non-pestiferous, voracious black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) to rapidly convert these wasted materials into a valuable protein-rich, high-fat insect biomass suitable for animal feed.  \r\n \r\nThe proposed project will explore dynamics related to generation of larval products in animal feed.  The project will untangle the dynamics controlling depletion of resources and heat exchange underpinning the insect-substrate-microbial complex within bioreactors. By leveraging the rapid turnover in insect generation time and applying Genomic Selection, the project will improve many economically relevant traits in BSFL, enhance bioconversion rates, and make the larvae more robust to thrive with a variety of waste feedstock materials. Similarly, by developing a proprietary bioreactor design to solve the challenges associated with heat exchange and oxygenation of colonies posed by traditional rearing systems and optimizing environmental conditions (heat, oxygen, and moisture) during larvae growth, the project will inhibit lethal conditions and permit a significantly higher stocking density. Overall, the main sustainability objective is to upcycle agricultural by-products that may contain toxic or undesired compounds. This project will assess the fate of pollutants in larval products, if any, in order to assure high-quality animal feed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
