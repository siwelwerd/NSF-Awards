 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a portable automated intravenous injector for easy and fast drug delivery and intravenous (IV) access in medical emergencies outside of the hospital. Each year, it is estimated that more than 350,000 people suffer from sudden cardiac arrest outside of the hospital and roughly only 10% survive. Data show that the use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) save more than 1600 people each year. The proposed portable automated intravenous injector would complement existing AEDs, which are widespread and commonly available. It is estimated that in emergency situations roughly 20% more lives could be saved if epinephrine or other drugs are used in conjunction with an AED. The proposed device may allow a non-trained operator to inject rescue medication following the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, by using a proprietary learning algorithm that will not require extensive medical knowledge.  It is estimated that the market size is around $5B for such a device that is complementary to the AED market. The global market size for intravenous access is estimated to about $11B including adjacent markets in hospital blood sampling, drug injection and other applications.  \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a portable automated intravenous injector, which is a smart injection device that senses the location and depth of a vein and injects a preset and safe dosage of a drug (in this application, epinephrine) using an algorithm derived from a combination of machine learning and big data. When attached to the forearm, the proposed technology is able to find the location and depth of the vein for drug injection automatically. It has two degrees of freedom. One is to move along the width of the forearm, and the second is to insert the needle inside the vein. The proposed technology uses ultrasound along with infrared light to locate and find the depth of the vein. It leverages Artificial intelligence algorithms to accurately detect the location of the vein and evaluate the patient's emergency.  The system is designed to continue to learn through the usage and trial phase, and as data continues to build the system it continues to get \u201csmarter\u201d and more accurate over time. The historical data may be mined further to allow for smarter insights into cardiac care decisions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over the course of the NSF I-Corps programs, we talked with over 350 potential customers, partners, and stakeholders, and found the home infusion industry significantly suffering from a shortage of nurses that can provide IV access services to outpatients, particularly in rural areas. The driving factor to hire a home infusion nurse is the ability to get IV access services and only a small subset of practicing nurses is skilled at doing this. 13.2% of 3.2 million home infusion patients need a new IV placement for their infusion [1]. Nurses on average spend 4 hours commuting to patients, and if they fail to get an IV in place, the whole treatment fails unless the provider sends another nurse to place the IV.

Our device has the support of Melissa Leon, senior nurse manager at CoramCVS who can deploy our portable venipuncture system in over 90 CoramCVS branches across the US, and Jennifer Charron, COO of National Home Infusion Association, which has a network of 900 home infusion sites across the country.</p>\n<p><strong>The Value Proposition&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p>In home infusion industry, several stakeholders such as home infusion providers, insurers, patients, and nurses benefit from PIV.

PIV not only opens these jobs for more nurses to practice but helps home care providers to increase the number of patients they can cover especially in rural areas where the access to healthcare is significantly limited [2]. Second, insurance companies will save on cost if patients switch to home infusion, and we learned from interviews that they encourage more patients to receive their treatment at home with incentives like lowering co-pay [3]. Home care providers can save around $20K/year or $10/h per nurse depending on the location using PIV since they do not have to hire highly experienced IV placement nurses.
