 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the great challenges of modern science is to bridge the gap between atomic and cellular level phenomena that affect outcomes in living systems. A potentially transformational facet of this challenge is Quantum Biology: understanding how quantum properties play governing roles in biological functions. The overarching goal of this project seeks to apply theory-driven predictions of Quantum Biology for multi-scale integration of cellular function. The inter-disciplinary team proposes to use front-edge computational and modelling techniques in synergy with advanced magnetic resonance techniques to probe quantum coherent pathways in the biochemical activity of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) that controls the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS is a highly reactive species and its buildup in cell causes damages and eventual cell death. The project aims to use computational and experimental approaches to provide ground-breaking insights into the requisite lifetimes for quantum coherence in ETF and its role in ROS production. Connecting persistent quantum effects to cellular behaviors bridge the atomic and cellular levels. The project pursues research that challenges fundamental assumptions about educational and research approaches and aims to achieve a paradigm shift beyond multidisciplinary approaches in the way the next generation of students are educated and introduced to quantum research. Researchers and students will develop necessary skills to accelerate and integrate new knowledge to converge research at the emerging frontier of Quantum Biology.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to connect broad spatio-temporal scales, from rapid dynamics at the molecular level to gradual ROS production at the macromolecular level. The project also focuses on a novel Quantum Biology area in cell redox biology: the activation of molecular oxygen by reduced flavoenzymes, where the production of reactive oxygen species can be described by manifestly quantum phenomena. Also included in this research is the development of the mathematical foundation of quantum optimal control with the ultimate goal of proving optimality condition in the form of Pontryagin\u2019s maximum principle. This project is supported by the Molecular Biophysics cluster of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
