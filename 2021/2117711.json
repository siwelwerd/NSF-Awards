 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Infrastructure (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a thermal Scanning Probe Lithography (t-SPL) system in a glovebox to be housed in the Boston College (BC) Cleanroom and Nanofabrication Facility (CNRF). Combined with the Boston College \u201ccleanroom in a glovebox\u201d, this system allows true nanoscale fabrication entirely in inert atmosphere. This setup is relatively easy to use, has superior capabilities that come without needing to gown up, and does not demand expensive infrastructure, training, and staff required by other cutting-edge nanofabrication tools. Thus, the project allows rapid and low-cost prototyping by researchers and local companies, cutting-edge research and training of undergraduate and graduate students in nanofabrication, and will be incorporated into summer programs and classes. The system is employed for an array of basic, applied, and interdisciplinary research at BC and the region including quantum materials, catalysis, microbial interactions, biological and chemical sensors. \r\n \r\nThe Nanofrazor, thermal Scanning Probe Lithography system inside a glovebox uses a thermal tip to both characterize the surface and remove the resist. As such the Nanofrazor minimizes the need for developer, produces superior surfaces to e-beam lithography (EBL) with competitive feature sizes (\u224815nm), operates in a glovebox, and 3D writing (\u22481nm height resolution). The minimal fabrication impact on the sample and operation in a glovebox provide new capabilities in cutting-edge 2D heterostructures and quantum materials that are often highly air sensitive. The t-SPL also provides novel device architectures requiring excellent contacts, 3D plasmonic structures, and small scales. These efforts together with the ability to rapidly fabricate new heterostructures (MBE/2D materials) and compounds with transfer via vacuum suitcase and a suite of characterization capabilities (diamond Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center, photocurrent, STM, TEM, Raman, magneto-transport) will amplify the impact of the t-SPL system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
