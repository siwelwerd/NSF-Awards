 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation supports  Drexel University with the acquisition of a state-of-the-art scanning electron microscope (SEM) designed for advanced imaging and analysis. The instrument placed in the Materials Characterization Core (MCC) shared-instrumentation facility provides all-around performance for imaging and analysis. The SEM replaces an outdated instrument and enhances research outcomes for a broad user base including over 40 research groups at Drexel and several users from nearby universities and businesses. The instrument significantly benefits researchers at Drexel University and promotes collaboration between Drexel and nearby institutions such as Villanova University, Temple University, and Rowan University. In addition to the versatile research activities enabled by the proposed SEM, the new SEM enhances Drexel\u2019s education and training experience considerably. The SEM is housed in and managed by an established core facility with full-time technical staff, with 15-year record for excellent stewardship of major instrumentation. The MCC promotes technical training of users such that they become proficient and independent users and partners with the University\u2019s academic units to provide undergraduate and graduate students with hands-on experiences integrated into course curricula. It contributes to the outreach program sponsored by the MCC and academic units to introduce young people to nanoscience, engineering, and technological research.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of a state-of-the-art scanning electron microscope (SEM) significantly strengthens the strong in situ electron microscopy capability at Drexel, and helps accelerate/facilitate research and educational activities in four critical areas: (1) New Materials for Energy and Sustainability \u2013 Temperature control and in operando electrochemistry in the SEM drive the discovery of new materials, materials systems, and structures to optimize next-generation battery technologies. (2) Advanced Mechanical Property Characterization \u2013 In situ mechanical testing at controlled temperatures combined with high-resolution imaging and chemical mapping to advance understanding of deformation mechanisms in novel layered crystalline solids and biomaterials. (3) Engineering Soft Materials and Biomaterials \u2013 High spatial resolution chemical mapping and low-current, low-vacuum imaging to expand research into liquid-free conformal polymer coatings and enable characterization and taxonomic classification of rare, historic collections of microscopic, fossilized diatoms. In situ mechanical testing at controlled temperatures will advance the development of new adhesives, polymer nanocomposites, and hydrogels. (4) Advanced Electronic Materials \u2013 In situ heating stages combined with charge-free imaging of insulating samples will enable new experiments on complex oxide heterostructures designed. Similarly, in situ heating will advance efforts to understand and design efficient fabrication processes for novel quantum materials and devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
