 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 55-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum.  The Belmont Forum is a consortium of research funding organizations focused on support for transdisciplinary approaches to global environmental change challenges and opportunities.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to establish the relation between the \ufb01sh resources and ocean fronts \u2013 areas where two distinct water masses meet in the oceans - and utilize that knowledge to understand how the fronts and the \ufb01shery related to them will change under different scenarios of changing climate. The project will focus on the Mozambique Channel where ocean front ecosystems are continually being formed and reformed.  This area plays an important role in the well-being and livelihoods of many people in the area who depend on these fisheries and ocean ecosystem.  Exploitation of the \ufb01sheries at these fronts poses a threat to the \ufb01sheries resources which tend to concentrate in slowly sinking waters of the frontal zone thus making them vulnerable to over-exploitation.  To maintain sustainable social and natural ecosystems, it is critical to understand how these frontal ecosystems and their marine fauna and \ufb02ora will be affected by changing climate.  This project will utilize existing satellite data from the Mozambique Channel to develop models that advance understanding of ocean fronts, and illuminate temporal and spatial dynamics of marine life using front ecosystems, including species important to commercial fisheries and to conservation. The results will improve management of tropical fisheries and improve conservation of large marine animals including dolphin, whales, manta rays, sharks and whale sharks. These results will directly benefit conservation and fisheries in the Mozambique channel and will inform improved management in similar systems throughout the tropics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
