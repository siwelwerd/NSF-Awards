 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum Computing has the potential, if realized, to significantly alter the computing landscape. However, building large-scale quantum computers is a key challenge. Quantum Networks (QNs) enable the construction of large, robust, and more capable quantum-computing platforms by connecting smaller quantum computers. Networked quantum systems have the potential to significantly alter various activities in society by leading to faster development in medicine and engineering; more secure and privacy-preserving communication; and hitherto infeasible optimizations that leverage the immense computational power to identify efficiencies in manufacturing, logistics, finance, etc. This project is also using the potential and attractiveness of QNs to design and offer a variety of educational programs, including a flexible post-baccalaureate program in quantum computing and networking to cater to non-traditional students, improve the diversity of undergraduate and graduate student body, and develop a quantum capable workforce.\r\n\r\nBuilding QNs that support robust communication across nodes requires several fundamental scientific and technological advances, especially since classical techniques cannot be directly used in the quantum regime. QNs can be used to build quantum computing systems that are more capable and more resilient than stand-alone quantum computers. This project is examining the design and implementation of QNs from the ground up by developing an infrastructure for efficient communication and management of quantum entanglements in the network. In addition, the project is addressing specific challenges in two key applications of QNs: (i) Distributed quantum algorithms, and (ii) Quantum sensor networks. The project is evaluating the developed techniques using large-scale simulations and over a 6-node QN testbed spread across Long Island, NY. The testbed is providing a high-fidelity platform to evaluate the effectiveness of our developed techniques.  Overall, the project has three research thrusts.\r\nIn the first thrust, the project is developing an infrastructure to facilitate efficient communication and entanglement management. In particular, it is developing optimization techniques for (i) efficient generation of long-distance entanglement using multiple paths, and (ii) efficient distribution of pre-distributed entanglements. In addition, the project is developing efficient entanglement-distillation strategies in practical settings, and protocols for multicast primitives.  In the second thrust, the project is addressing challenges in the context of two key QN applications to corroborate and validate the developed techniques. In particular, the project is developing optimization techniques for efficient distributed implementation of centralized quantum circuits; efficient distributed implementations are important for QN\u2019s computational success. In the context of quantum sensor networks, it is designing efficient protocols for the estimation of binary parameter functions and investigating the benefit of entanglements in these settings.  In the third thrust, the project is evaluating the above techniques using large-scale simulations and a small QN testbed. To evaluate QN performance effectively, the project is formulating novel performance metrics for QNs; this requires non-trivial generalization of the classical network metrics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
