 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless powered backscatter communication (WPBC) has emerged as a promising technology to support long-term, low-cost, and low-complexity Internet-of-Things (IoT) device communications and networking. Ensuring WPBC security is crucially important to drive its wide applications, e.g., smart cities, smart wearables, smart agriculture, smart skins, mobile payment, and supply chain. However, resource constraints on backscatter devices and the broadcast nature of radio transmissions render the securing of WPBC challenging. Aiming to enhance the resource-constrained WPBC network security, the PIs propose novel techniques that exploit physical layer properties of WPBC and machine learning technologies to achieve efficient key agreement, anti-jamming communication, and robust device authentication with joint consideration of energy efficiency, security, and communication performance. The proposed research is expected to greatly advance the understanding of the design tradeoff between communication and security performance goals in WPBC networks. Under-represented students will be actively involved in the proposed research activities through senior design projects, summer interns, and outreach programs. Research results will be integrated in teaching and disseminated through publications, presentations, and a project website. A significant amount of experimental data will be collected and shared to the wireless communication and networking community.\r\n\r\nThree major research thrusts are proposed in this project. Thrust 1 investigates efficient and scalable key generation schemes between/among wireless powered backscatter devices. Unique challenges in backscatter communication and resource constraints will be efficiently addressed by transceiver designs and optimization. The energy efficiency of the proposed schemes is expected to outperform traditional cryptography-based schemes (e.g., Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange) by one to two orders of magnitude. Thrust 2 studies anti-jamming schemes based on multi-armed bandit (MAB) online learning frameworks to effectively harvest jamming energy to achieve reliable and efficient WPBC in a multi-channel network. The proposed scheme will turn jamming into an energy harvesting opportunity while achieving reliable communication through learning the jammed and jamming-free channels online. The proposed scheme will enjoy low computational and storage overhead. In Thrust 3, the proposed device authentication schemes are expected to achieve high authentication performance by exploiting new factors (i.e., incident signal randomization, angle of arrival estimation) at the physical layer. They can be integrated with higher layer cryptography-based authentication schemes to enable multi-factor authentication with capabilities of detecting and tracing illegal devices. A multi-channel WPBC testbed operating in sub-6GHz bands will be developed based on the wireless identification and sensing platform (WISP) and Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This proof-of-concept design presents a groundbreaking alternative to the conventional RIS and RIS-assisted devices that are power-hungry and computationally heavy. Additionally, with its low power consumption, 65 &micro;W in detection mode and 143 &micro;W in communication mode, it is expected that this Rotman Lens-based RIS-assisted mmID tag system has the potential to be further developed to a fully \"zero-power\" passive device supported entirely by wireless energy harvesting. In addition, operating the system in the more power-hungry beam re-direction (communication) mode only when needed allows the system to operate more efficiently and, therefore, last longer. In detection mode, the system can intermittently check if the harvested signal source is still present before switching to communication mode, which causes more power. With 75 dBm EIRP, this RIS-assisted mmID tag system can operate up to 75 m away for communication mode and 89 m for detection mode. Meanwhile, since this system assumes the transmitting and receiving antennas are spatially separated in the bistatic configuration, the RCS and indoor mid-range analysis also suggest this system can be operated in long-range with high sensitivity while being copolarized to enhance wireless communication networks in complex environments with controllable and selective beamforming. Meanwhile, due to the long transmission line on the device to enable re-directing capability, the re-directing signal travels to the receiver slower than the reflective signal from the ground plane. Even though the length of the transmission lines is on a mm scale, it is significant enough to be easily distinguishable in the time domain, simplifying the calibration in signal processing. Since most existing RIS and RIS-assisted devices are realized using phased arrays that consume a significant amount of power that wireless energy harvesting cannot support, developing them into energy-autonomous designs using RF energy harvesting techniques is not feasible. This work, on the other hand, displays a Rotman Lens-based RIS-assisted mmID tag system that maintains the functionality of a traditional RIS with low power consumption, breaking the tradeoff between selective beamforming and power consumption and opening a door for energy-autonomous RIS development. It presents the potential&nbsp;for fully passive beyond-5G RIS-assisted mmIDs for future applications, such as smart cities, smart agriculture, and industry 4.0, in complex real-world environments.</p>\r\n<p>The latest iterations of the designs allow mmWave signals to be modulated with ASK or BPSK, depending on the user case and the requirement for future data security. In addition, two other designs are developed and evaluated to address some foreseeable future challenges for the energy-autonomous RIS-assisted mmID tag system. To address the low energy harvesting efficiency for mmWave, a new diode MA4E2037 is used and characterized to develop a self-biased rectifier. Moreover, since the latest iterations of the system are co-polarized in transmitting and receiving, it is limited to only operating in such a condition. Therefore, a dual-polarized semi-passive energy detection backscattering radio frequency identification (RFID) is designed to support signal detection from cross-polarized sources. This design can be implemented into the next iteration of the Rotman Lens-based RIS-assisted mmID tag system to achieve more versatile performance. Another foreseeable challenge is that mmWave suffers from signal blockage and attention compared to its lower-frequency counterparts. Therefore, a possible solution is proposed to harvest energy in a lower frequency band while transmitting signals in mmWave. This will allow the system to benefit from the advantage of low signal attenuation in the lower frequency band for energy harvesting and the high data rate in mmWave for signal transmission. To explore this method, a sub-6 GHz dual-band rectifier at 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz is designed and optimized to maximize the harvesting efficiency. This work can be later implemented in the next iteration to support the energy harvesting feature. In conclusion, this work has opened a door for an energy-autonomous RIS device in mmWave, which has not been explored much in the current literature. In addition, the two developed iterations give freedom to different signal modulation types. Meanwhile, additional work has been done to address foreseeable challenges in implementing this RIS-assisted mmID tag system into realistic IoT, digital twins, precision agriculture and smart manufaturing applications.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 03/19/2025<br>\nModified by: Emmanouil&nbsp;M&nbsp;Tentzeris</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2131406/2131406_10764042_1736636068735_iter4_fab--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2131406/2131406_10764042_1736636068735_iter4_fab--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fabricated prototype\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2131406/2131406_10764042_1736636068735_iter4_fab--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fabricated prototype\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fabricated prototype of the near-zero-power RIS-enabled mmID with dual operability (energy harvesting and communication/beam redirection)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Georgia Tech</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Emmanouil&nbsp;M&nbsp;Tentzeris\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fabricated prototype</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2131406/2131406_10764042_1736636390528_iter3_block--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2131406/2131406_10764042_1736636390528_iter3_block--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dual-mode operability schematic\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2131406/2131406_10764042_1736636390528_iter3_block--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dual-mode operability schematic\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dual-mode (Energy harvesting and Communication/Beam Redirection) operability schematic of the \"near-zero-power\" Rotman-lens based RIS-assisted mmID</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Georgia Tech</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Emmanouil&nbsp;M&nbsp;Tentzeris\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Dual-mode operability schematic</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
