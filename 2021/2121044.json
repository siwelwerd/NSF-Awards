 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum sensing has the potential to revolutionize understanding of the inner workings\u2014the molecular underpinnings\u2014of biology and human health. Quantum sensing will allow probing the physical properties of biological systems with nanometer resolution and single-molecule sensitivity, resolving the microscopic relationships among ions, molecules, cells, and tissues while also elucidating dynamics. The Institute for Quantum Sensing in Biophysics and Bioengineering will create new types of biocompatible quantum sensors and embed these quantum sensors within biological systems to extract new information and gain control over biological processes that, until now, have been beyond reach. The Institute brings together researchers from materials science, physics, chemistry, engineering, biology, and medicine working side-by-side at every step to define and tackle these manifestly interdisciplinary challenges.\r\n\r\nThe Institute will train the future quantum technology workforce by creating a Quantum Academy (for K-12) and Quantum Institute (post-secondary workforce training). These programs will work with underserved communities within Chicago, exposing students to quantum science and training teachers in the development of quantum science curriculum. These programs seek to show students not only the material, but also the scientific process, to help them understand quantum science and see themselves as scientists. The programs also will match trainees with potential employers in quantum technology fields.\r\n\r\nThe Quantum Leap Challenge Institute for Quantum Sensing in Biophysics and Bioengineering will develop biocompatible quantum materials, establish protocols for quantum sensing and imaging within cells, and demonstrate the utility of quantum measurements in biology and medicine. The research is focused on four thrusts. In the sensing thrust, this project will define novel biocompatible probes to enable quantum measurements that are correlated in time and/or space. In the biological targeting thrust, material compatibility and biochemical specific targeting will be ensured, and sensing protocols will be developed to overcome issues related to integrating quantum sensors into living cells. In the correlative imaging thrust, the Institute will develop controlled test cases, image processing techniques, and reconstruction tools that exploit both classical and quantum correlations for imaging biological systems. Importantly, these three thrusts are tightly connected to a fourth thrust centered on biophysical and biological grand challenges to help image dynamics in ion channels, force networks, bioelectricity, and cellular communication.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
