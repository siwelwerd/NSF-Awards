 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). \r\n\r\nMalaria is extremely deadly: In 2019, 229 million cases worldwide caused 409,000 deaths; 23% of those deaths occurred in Nigeria. One key problem is the prevalence of substandard antimalarials: various studies find 11.8% (Beargie et al.) to 23% (WHO) of antimalarials sold do not have the correct active pharmaceutical ingredients percentage, typically meaning the pills are either counterfeits or were improperly stored. 35% of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) \u2014 the WHO's recommended treatment for uncomplicated malaria \u2014 were found to be substandard in a six-country study in sub-Saharan Africa (Bate et al.). Estimates indicate \u201cpoor-quality antimalarials are responsible for 12,300 deaths and $892 million ($890-$893 million) in costs annually in Nigeria\u201d (Beargie et al.). In addition to ACTs, consumers have access to many less effective substitutes, including less effective drugs such as chloroquine and drugs not intended for the treatment of malaria. While a quarter of Nigerians mention ACTs when asked about malaria treatments they would use, 17% mention chloroquine, and 20% cite over-the-counter painkillers (aspirin, paracetamol, etc.) (DHS). Why are less effective treatments commonly used? In addition to a somewhat lower price point, consumers cannot be certain whether a drug they purchase is substandard and likely have difficulty assessing the relative effectiveness of different treatment options. Improving the functioning of markets for antimalarials can help affordable and effective, high-quality drugs reach those in need. This study seeks to improves our understanding of this vital market and highlight how consumer uncertainty about drug quality affects antimalarial choices. Beyond malaria, understanding how health product choices relate to perceptions of product quality could be valuable to policy makers trying to increase take-up of high-quality pharmaceuticals, such as Covid-19 vaccines: similar mechanisms will likely be at play, and counterfeit Covid-19 vaccines have been found in South Africa. \r\n\r\n\r\nMarkets in low-income countries often fail to reliably provide high-quality versions of goods. Both theoretical and empirical work has highlighted the importance of information frictions in the low-quality equilibrium. This project will investigate information frictions in the antimalarials market. This market features quality uncertainty because i) highly effective drugs may be counterfeits or degraded, ii) myriad lower-quality alternatives exist, including weaker drugs and traditional remedies, and iii) learning about product quality is difficult, e.g. because antimalarials may be used to treat non-malaria fevers. The project asks four related questions about information frictions and the antimalarial market: how do information frictions influence demand for quality; what are the welfare consequences of information frictions, accounting for how beliefs about quality influence price, quality provision, and adoption in equilibrium; what are the distributional consequences of reducing information frictions; and how do information frictions influence the welfare effects and efficacy of common policies to increase uptake of high-quality antimalarials. To answer these questions, the project combines an RCT providing drug quality information (including free drug testing) to consumers with a structural model. The RCT allows for precise estimates of the effect of quality beliefs on demand for quality and evaluates a policy relevant intervention for improving uptake of high-quality antimalarials. The structural model, incorporating treatment effect estimates from the RCT, allows for counterfactual simulations of adoption choices and welfare under improved quality information. The model features both biased and noisy beliefs, advancing existing structural approaches, by using data on both beliefs about drug quality and true quality from test results.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

During this pilot, we interviewed 427 urban households, 301 peri-urban households, 59 urban antimalarial vendors, 27 peri-urban antimalarial vendors, and we tested the quality of 369 antimalarial tablets using RxAll handheld scanner devices.</p>\n<p class=\"western\" lang=\"en-GB\">Initial analysis of the data highlights several important findings regarding take-up of high-quality antimalarials (specifically, artemisinin combination therapies [ACTs] rather than other pharmaceutical products or traditional medicines), antimalarial quality in urban Nigeria, and vendor choice. First, we found that take-up of ACTs, the highest quality antimalarial treatment, in urban Kano is quite high, at 72 percent. This take-up rate is three times the average for Nigeria in surveys from the Demographic and Health Surveys program, although those surveys do document higher ACT take-up in other urban areas and among wealthier households with more education. Surprisingly, our take-up results were similar in peri-urban Kano, with 74 percent of households selecting ACTs as their malaria treatment of choice. We also noted that respondents commonly used multiple products to cope with a malaria infection, anecdotally often using both ACTs to treat the disease and painkillers to reduce its symptoms.</p>\n<p class=\"western\" lang=\"en-GB\">Second, we measured ACT quality by having mystery shoppers purchase ACTs and then testing whether the pills were substandard using RxAll devices. Note that substandard pills refer to pills that are less effective than they should be for any reason, including counterfeit pills or pills degraded due to improper storage. We find that antimalarial quality is generally better than previous studies had assessed, but also find considerable differences across different brands of pills. While previous results often found over ten percent of pills to be substandard, we find that only roughly four percent of pills from a popular and more expensive brand were substandard, while rates were higher, at 21 percent, for a lower priced and less popular brand. Beliefs about drug quality vary; most respondents do not think substandard medicines are commonplace, with the median respondent believing that only one out of ten pills would be substandard. However, some households believe drug quality to be considerably worse as beliefs were right skewed with a mean number of pills believed to be substandard at two.</p>\n<p class=\"western\" lang=\"en-GB\">Subsequently, we analyzed the relationship between beliefs about antimalarial treatment effectiveness and antimalarial choice, finding that believing ACTs are the highest quality option is associated with a 26 to 36 percentage point increase in the probability of selecting an ACT. This result highlights the importance of across-product quality beliefs for antimalarial choice, which is important since it suggests that in areas with lower take-up rates than we find, there may be some scope for simply attempting to highlight ACTs as the most effective treatment option. Last, we performed descriptive analysis of antimalarial vendor choice for respondents who purchased an ACT for their most recent malaria episode. We find over half of households that purchase an ACT consider only one vendor for their purchase; this lack of competition increases vendor's incentives both to raise ACT prices in general and to engage in second-degree price discrimination by charging higher prices for ACTs relative to other treatments, such as quinines.</p>\n<p class=\"western\" lang=\"en-GB\">Overall, the pilot results highlight the progress achieved in urban Northern Nigeria, relative to both findings in the previous literature and country-wide averages, regarding antimalarial choice as well as the quality of antimalarials (noting that we could only test a limited number of brands with the RxAll devices).</p>\n<p class=\"western\" lang=\"en-GB\">Building upon this pilot, we hope to conduct a larger randomized evaluation of providing quality information to study how uncertainty about quality combined with imperfect competition change the effectiveness of policies to increase antimalarial take-up.
