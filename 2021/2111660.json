 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the neural basis of brain function remains elusive mainly due to the lack of tools and techniques for high throughput, high resolution recording from the brain. Many individual neurons orchestrate the processing and transmission of information across different areas of the brain, so it is necessary to record neuronal activity with high temporal and spatial resolution. Surgically implanted neural probes are widely used to record the electrophysiology activity in the brain. In this project, the investigators seek to design a novel neural probe, in which the neural signals are transduced to an optical signal using an electro-opto-mechanic sensor. The single optical interconnect in this probe can carry the wavelength-multiplexed data from many different channels, rather than requiring many wires to transmit the signals from different channels. This approach will enable scaling up the number of channels without having to increase the size of the neural probes. This multifaceted project will showcase how photonics, electro-mechanics, nanotechnology and neural engineering can be combined to bring about novel design concepts. Therefore, this project will provide a rich educational and training opportunity for undergraduate and graduate researchers seeking career opportunities in these fields.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this multidisciplinary project is to leverage advancements in photonics and electromechanical systems to design a radically new implantable neural interface platform based on electro-opto-mechanical detection and wavelength-domain multiplexed transmission of neural signals. High-density neural probes are in high and growing demand. Such devices must be compact, high-density, mass-producible and reliable. The proposed research introduces a new platform for recording neural activity that enables simultaneous recording from many channels to better understand the neural basis of brain function and dysfunction. In this design, the electrophysiological activity of neural signals will be converted to a mechanical signal and then to an optical signal that will be routed to an optical detection system located outside the brain. This way, the neural signals can be recorded with a very high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Different channels are encoded into different wavelengths of light and the aggregate data is transmitted over a single optical channel with no interference. This new platform for neural recording can be used in different neuroscience and clinical applications in future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
