 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dryland ecosystems occupy nearly half of the Earth\u2019s land surface and provide goods and services for more than 1 billion people. The goal of the Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program is to understand what factors are most important to the ecology of drylands \u2013 what they look like and how they function. Jornada Basin is in the Chihuahuan Desert, which is typical of many other drylands around the world. The project builds on studies started in 1915 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That early research has revealed \u201cdesertification\u201d -- a change in habitat from grasslands to scattered shrubs and bare ground. More recently, researchers have explored how differences in wind and water cause dryland habitats to undergo other changes in vegetation  A new way of looking at data will enable results of this ongoing study to be applied to other drylands. Training opportunities will be provided for graduate and undergraduate students at four Hispanic-serving institutions in New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. Findings will be distributed to K-12 students and teachers, scientists, land managers, and the public through a multi-faceted program that includes inquiry-based curricula, workshops, internet- and mobile-phone-based systems.\r\n\r\nResearchers will quantify the key processes that generate alternative states in drylands, enabling prediction of future states and their consequences for the provisioning of ecosystem services. Based on long-term databases, new studies will include four types of dynamics: (1) a shift from perennial grasslands to desertified shrublands, (2) a reversal from shrubland to savanna states, (3) transitions among states dominated by different shrub species, and (4) invasion by non-native grasses. These transitions have profound implications for the processes reflected in the 5 core LTER research themes (primary production, trophic interactions, carbon and nutrient cycles, and susceptibility to disturbance). In the next six years, Principal Investigators will employ a \"trigger-feedback-heterogeneity\" framework for understanding and predicting the dynamics of state changes in dryland landscapes. The work will contribute to emerging ecological theory on: (a) alternative states and resilience, (b) ecosystem sensitivity to global change, and (c) cross-scale interactions. The framework will integrate knowledge and long-term data on: (1) biological processes, (2) spatial heterogeneity in the soil-geomorphic template, and (3) variability in environmental drivers drawn from multiple lines of evidence (i.e., observations, experimental manipulations, analytical and numerical models, products from imagery, conceptual model reasoning, and theory). Researchers will develop a Data Science Integrated System that will allow Jornada results to be translated to other locations in the Chihuahuan Desert and to drylands globally. Five major products are envisioned: (1) a new understanding of state changes that will lead to theory development, testable hypotheses, and new experiments; (2) accessible data, derived data products, and visualization tools applicable at multiple scales; (3) explanatory and predictive relationships among drivers, patterns, and processes that can be used to (4) predict future alternative states; and (5) training, outreach and information transfer to a broad audience locally, nationally, and internationally.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
