 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optical photons are the only qubits that can traverse long distances at room temperature. They are thus uniquely suitable for interconnecting remote quantum nodes for secure quantum communication, distributed quantum information processing, and distributed quantum sensing. A key enabler for these applications is the capability to efficiently generate, measure, and transform entangled photons. However, these tasks are extremely challenging since photons normally do not interact with each other. In this program, the principal investigators will develop a set of new technologies for efficient generation, transformation, and characterization of multi-photon entangled states, and explore their new enabling applications in quantum networking and quantum interconnects. The project will contribute to the development of quantum repeaters and the quantum internet. The program also includes a strong education and outreach effort that will contribute to the growing movement to introduce quantum mechanics and information to high-school and early undergraduate curricula. This effort includes designing online quantum games that highlight the novel capabilities that quantum mechanics affords in communication and networking.\r\n\r\nMulti-photon entangled states are fundamental resources for quantum networking, distributed and photonic quantum computing, and quantum sensing. However, efficient generation, characterization, and transformation of multi-photon entangled states remain an outstanding challenge. In this program, a cross-disciplinary team consisting of mathematicians, information theorists, quantum physicists, photonic engineers, and materials scientists will develop a set of new technologies for creating, evaluating, and using multi-photon entangled states for quantum networking and quantum interconnects. The team has recently made an enabling theoretical breakthrough, showing that it is possible to deterministically generate a variety of multi-photon entangled states by using only a single spin-tagged quantum emitter coupled with a few ancillary qubits. Guided by these theoretical discoveries, the team will experimentally demonstrate efficient generation of photonic entangled states by using solid-state quantum emitters coupled with a nanophotonic cavity. They will also employ integrated nonlinear photonics for efficient transformation of multi-photon entangled states. Quantum state verification protocols will be developed for efficient state characterization to overcome scaling challenges associated with quantum state tomography. The experimental efforts will be informed by quantum information theory that explores new and optimized state engineering protocols as well as novel applications of multipartite entangled photons in quantum communication and networking.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
