 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an online software platform to enhance workplace support for and increase productivity of Autistic individuals.  There is a growing body of evidence about the organizational value of hiring workers with disabilities. Many top corporations in the US embrace a social responsibility agenda, seeking to comply with federal guidelines and appeal to like-minded customers. Federal support for the inclusion of individuals with disabilities is reflected in US policies and states offer tax credits to employers who employ individuals with disabilities.  The aim of the proposed technology is to build an accessible, scalable solution, available via mobile devices (e.g., smartphone, tablet, laptop) that empowers the employee while conveying benefits to the employer.  The most important anticipated impact will be in increased opportunities for Autistic and other neurodivergent individuals, particularly those living with co-occurring behavioral health challenges, to achieve successful employment.  The use of the proposed online, accessible tools and resources may contribute to positive changes in motivation, self-efficacy, social support, and job tenure while being readily scalable.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of user-friendly online software tools and resources available via smartphone, tablet, or laptop to support Autistic employees in achieving employment success.  The proposed technology is derived from evidence-based, in-person supported employment studies and knowledge and understanding gained through years of implementation, research and multiple randomized controlled trials. In-person support is relatively expensive (e.g., training the provider, implementing logistics), not widely available, and not readily accessible in the workplace.  The initial prototype technology has been developed and validated through user-experience design and feasibility studies. It is unique in its workplace focus, research foundation, and attention to both behavioral health and neurodivergence.  The proposed tools may be effective stand-alone resources or may be used in addition to in-person support to broaden and sustain impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
