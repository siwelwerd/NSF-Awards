 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Quantum Technologies (CQT) is a partnership between Purdue University, Indiana University, the University of Notre Dame, and Indiana University Purdue University - Indianapolis (IUPUI). The mission of the CQT is to collaborate with industry and government stakeholders to identify compelling needs and challenges in quantum technologies, and then develop novel solutions to address these opportunities. Quantum technologies are governed by the physics of sub-atomic particles and have relevance to computing, sensing, imaging, metrology, communications, and cryptography. Because of their wide-ranging applicability, quantum technologies have the potential to be transformative, with uses in intelligence, financial security, computing, medicine, and navigation. Society has entered the second quantum revolution, but it is still in its infancy, and the nascent quantum industry requires significant fundamental research to mature novel technologies. In partnership with industrial members, the CQT researchers will use their expertise in quantum science and engineering to develop and transfer foundational knowledge into industry-friendly quantum devices, systems, and algorithms with enhanced functionality and performance. Additionally, the CQT will help train the next generation of quantum scientists and engineers to support the development of a critically needed quantum workforce. Students will not only conduct Center research, but also help writing project reports, present at biannual meetings, and interact with industry and government members. Finally, the CQT will leverage established programs at each of the four universities to engage and support students traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines. \r\n\r\nAs one of the four Center sites, the University of Notre Dame will leverage its existing Centers and industrial relationships to drive quantum research in the areas of advanced materials and devices, quantum simulations of physical phenomena such as spin chemistry, quantum algorithms for data sciences and machine learning, and high-performance computing systems architectures. For example, Notre Dame leads the ASCENT Center, a consortium of 14 universities, on the research and development of devices that use quantum effects. Also, Notre Dame\u2019s Quantum Computing Lab (QCLab) has a long-running relationship with industry into quantum simulations of spin-chemical phenomena.  As a member of IBM\u2019s Q Network, university researchers and their students have access to IBM\u2019s quantum computers.  Notre Dame faculty study the architecture and limits of classical supercomputers and foundational studies into the emerging \u201cexascale\u201d computers. In addition, Notre Dame\u2019s CQT activities will mesh with other campus Centers, including the Center for STEM Education, the Center for Civic Innovation, and iNDustry Labs, to expand both workforce development and STEM education of underrepresented groups into the quantum realm.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
