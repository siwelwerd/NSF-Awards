 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant explores how communicating science through a variety of video production techniques can be used to educate students, inform the scientific community, and engage the general public about the process and discoveries of current scientific research. Digital technological advancements and the wake of the global pandemic have created new opportunities for formal and informal learning through asynchronous viewing of videos. Understanding how various audiences respond to a spectrum of production styles and approaches will provide new strategies for improving science literacy through video, including among groups traditionally underserved by science communication and education. Furthermore, this project will assess how training early career scientists, particularly those from underrepresented groups, can elevate the science communication skill set of the next generation of STEM professionals.\r\n\r\nThis project will use both remote and in-person video recordings to combine interview footage, on-scene recording, and science talks with animation, music, and other post-production elements to tell the stories of science using the full palate of video production techniques. The resulting products include: videos and curricular resources for undergraduate biology students developed in collaboration with educators, short films for broader audiences, and science communication training for early career researchers from diverse backgrounds. The video products and trainings will be matched with evaluations, including validated surveys, focus groups, and novel assessment tools developed by the research team. Evaluating engagement and learning across diverse audiences will help identify fundamental principles of effective communication through science videos. This proposal was funded with support from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
