 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mote Marine Laboratory (MML)in Sarasota, FL will host a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program. The program will bring ten undergraduates to MML each summer for three years.  Interns will conduct semi-independent research projects during the 10-week program that are centered on initiatives for restoring ocean health for future generations. In addition to improved research skills, students gain valuable experience in scientific communication by developing research proposals and reporting their findings in scientific poster presentations. Career guidance on grantsmanship, scientific writing, poster and oral research presentation, and pursuing graduate study in Ocean Sciences is provided in student- centered discussion groups. Students will be exposed to a broader range of topics in coastal and estuarine sciences by attending research seminars presented by Mote scientific staff, visiting scientists, and Mote NSF REU Program alumni. Participants are encouraged to present research findings in peer-reviewed literature and/or at professional conferences. \r\n\r\nThe program is designed to advance discovery in estuarine and coastal sciences while simultaneously promoting education and career development of future ocean science professionals. This is accomplished by 1) providing students with direct, \u2018hands-on\u2019 research experiences in diverse ocean science topics; 2) developing meaningful relationships between students and ocean science professionals; and 3) exposing undergraduates to various skills necessary to pursue a successful career in science. Students are paired with MML researchers from twenty-three Programs and conduct mentored research projects on one of the several major threats to coastal habitats: aquatic pollution, ocean acidification, natural toxins, habitat alteration, coral reef decline, new and emerging marine diseases, deteriorating water quality, and impacts of overfishing on fisheries ecology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
