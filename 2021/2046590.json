 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project promotes the progress and advancement of scientific knowledge by exploring new\r\nmethods for understanding and modeling online sentiment. As the Web has become critical to\r\nsociety, impacting our personal lives as well as the world at large, a greater need to understand\r\nhow people interact. In particular, research into how to measure people\u2019s opinion on various\r\ntopics or types of content has failed to address the new ways and types of content used on the\r\nevolving social Web. This project addresses this lack of understanding by developing new tools\r\nto help quantify online sentiment using large-scale, empirical data. In addition to these new\r\ntools, output from the project, including datasets and code artifacts will help other researchers\r\nadvance our understanding of social media.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this project, the investigator seeks to achieve four research objectives. The first is the\r\ncreation of a multi-platform social media dataset. In particular, the investigator will develop a\r\nseries of tools leveraging prior experience in large-scale data collection to perform continuous\r\nidentification and collection of multimedia data from emerging social media platforms. Next, the\r\ninvestigator will develop data-driven techniques to understand coded language used in social\r\nmedia. These techniques will focus not just on textual content, e.g., slang words, but also coded\r\nvisual language, e.g., memes. The third objective is developing a new, explainable system for\r\nrating the sentiment of content. This method departs from existing approaches by treating the\r\nclassification task as a game between two pieces of content and learning a total ordering of the\r\ncontent devised from the Elo rating system used in chess and video games. Finally, the\r\ninvestigator will explore user and community level modeling of online sentiment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
