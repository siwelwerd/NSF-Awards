 "awd_abstract_narration": "The amount of freshwater in the Arctic Ocean has been increasing substantially over the past two decades, and climate projections indicate that this will lead to enhanced transfer of this water southward to the North Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, the meltwater discharge from the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating over the last 30 years. Both of these sources of freshwater end up in the boundary current that encircles Greenland. It is imperative to determine the ultimate fate of this water. If it gets fluxed offshore of the boundary current it could impact the large-scale global overturning circulation that helps maintain Earth\u2019s climate. Furthermore, underneath this freshwater, the boundary current carries warm water that originated from the subtropics. This heat has been implicated in causing basal melt in Greenland\u2019s glaciers \u2013 which in turn would lead to more freshwater release. As such, we need to understand how the warm subtropical-origin water makes it to the glaciers. The proposed project is designed to address the pathways and fate of both the freshwater and heat carried in the boundary current along West Greenland. We will conduct a detailed shipboard survey in Baffin Bay, including measurements along some of the channels leading to west Greenland\u2019s glacial fjords. This is made possible because the US icebreaker Healy is undertaking a rare mission to the eastern sector of the Arctic, allowing for this unique set of measurements. Two contributing studies will be undertaken by collaborators, at no cost to the project. The first will address the different sources of freshwater using chemical measurements, and the second will shed light the circulation near the fjords using a remotely operated vehicle. A post-doc and three graduate students will participate on the cruise.\r\n\r\nAn extensive hydrographic/velocity survey will be conducted on the USCGC Healy, from Davis Strait to the northern part of Baffin Bay, to determine the pathways and fate of heat and freshwater that are advected into the region by the West Greenland Current (WGC). The project takes advantage of the fact that Healy will be operating in the eastern Arctic in summer/fall 2021 and is available for a scientific cruise from mid-September to mid-October. A strategic set of high-resolution sections has been designed to (1) estimate the flux of freshwater from the WGC into the interior; (2) address the two-way exchange of the WGC with the fjords draining several West Greenland glaciers via deep troughs on the shelf; and (3) quantify the structure and evolution of the WGC, as well as the circulation of Baffin Bay to assess its volume, freshwater, and heat budgets. Such a survey has never been done in the study region at small enough station spacing to resolve all of the important currents, with the inclusion of direct velocity measurements, while simultaneously providing the broad coverage necessary to address basin-wide issues. We will use Healy\u2019s conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) system, and its hullmounted acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), along with expendable CTDs to fill in gaps. Two collaborative programs will be carried out at no-cost to the project. The first will measure nutrients and oxygen isotopes to help distinguish the freshwater sources, and the second will deploy a Seaglider to map out warm water pathways and mixing near Jakobshavn glacier. A post-doc and three graduate students will participate on the cruise.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Some models predict that, in just a few decades, the Arctic will be ice-free during the summer months. At the same time, the Greenland ice cap is undergoing accelerated ice loss, which is largely due to warm ocean waters from the south melting the undersides of the glaciers surrounding the coast. Two important questions associated with this are: (1) What is the ultimate fate of the increased meltwater? and (2) How are the warm waters able to get so close to the coast of Greenland? To address these questions, we carried out an extensive shipboard hydrographic survey of the circulation and water characteristics in Baffin Bay (on the western side of Greenland) on the US Coast Guard Cutter Healy. The cruise took place in Sep-Oct 2021. During the expedition, 215 stations were occupied where we obtained vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and other variables. In addition, we dropped numerous expendable probes to obtain extra profiles of temperature and salinity. The hull-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) collected velocity data continuously. In addition to our work, we facilitated seven ancillary programs by other investigators. This included the collection of water sample chemistry data, the deployment of an autonomous underwater vehicle, a bottom survey on the Baffin Island slope, and launching a suite of surface drifters.<br /><br />The hydrographic survey included 6 crossings of the West Greenland Current, 5 crossings of the Baffin Island Current, and 4 trans-basin sections (See Fig. 1). In addition, 4 different troughs were sampled: three on the west Greenland shelf, including the Uummannaq trough (2 sections) and Jakobshavn trough (3 sections), and one on the Baffin Island shelf. All of the data have been processed and are ready to be used for analysis. The data collected on the cruise will enable us to fundamentally advance our understanding of the evolution of the boundary current system as it encircles Baffin Bay, the mechanisms by which heat is transferred from the west Greenland boundary current to glacial fjords via deep troughs in the continental shelf, and the general circulation and water characteristics of Baffin Bay,</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/16/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robert&nbsp;S&nbsp;Pickart</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2034801/2034801_10726949_1655404491670_basemap_hly21_combined--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2034801/2034801_10726949_1655404491670_basemap_hly21_combined--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Measurements carried out on Healy's 2021 Baffin Bay expedition\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2034801/2034801_10726949_1655404491670_basemap_hly21_combined--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Measurements carried out on Healy's 2021 Baffin Bay expedition\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
