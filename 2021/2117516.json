 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The University of Arizona is acquiring a single crystal X-ray diffractometer (SCXRD) to support Professor Elisa Tomat and colleagues Wei Wang, Jon Njardarson, Thomas Gianetti and Tai Kong. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students, including veterans, in chemistry and biochemistry at this Hispanic Serving Institution as well as collaborators from other regional universities in the Southwest (Arizona/New Mexico region). \r\n\r\nThe award of this diffractometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts the exploration of coordination chemistry strategies in bioinorganic redox reactivity and cell biology and the design of organic reactions such as those for total natural product synthesis. The instrumentation is also used for developing carbenium-based ligands for catalytic applications and the development of chemical tools for biology and potential drug discovery.  The instrument also serves researchers searching for natural-product-based compounds that may act as therapeutics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
