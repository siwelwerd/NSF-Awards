 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will model the evolution of matter outflows following the merger of neutron star binaries. The project will stitch together the results from simulations that are valid at different scales, using the output of smaller scale simulations as the input for larger scale simulations. In this way, the project will be able to follow the matter outflows and jets from the initial merger event all the way out to the point where the material interacts with the interstellar medium. The project will be able to predict the electromagnetic signals from the merger and relate them to the initial properties of the binary system. The project will also develop materials for use in public outreach to bring astronomy education to students in kindergarten through high school. This award advances the goals of the Windows on the Universe Big Idea. This project is supported by both the National Science Foundation and the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation to further collaborations between the astrophysical communities in the two countries. \r\n\r\nThe project will start with final snapshots from general relativity simulations of the merger event as initial conditions for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. Similarly, the final snapshots of the GRMHD simulations will be used as initial conditions for the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations that carry the jets out to distances where it interacts with the interstellar medium. The project will then calculate electromagnetic signals from the simulation results using a radiative transfer code. The simulations will be run on GPUs for increased computational efficiency. The project will also develop \"Star Packs\" for the Sacramento Library appropriate for K-5 students that can be checked out in libraries. The PI at Purdue will develop instructional materials on gravity and black holes for middle- and high-school students. The Northwestern PI will develop instructional materials for an electro-magnetism class at the high-school level.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
