 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The University of Pennsylvania is acquiring an X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) source with synchrotron-quality spectra capabilities to support the research of Professor Daniel Mindiola and colleagues Marisa Kozlowski, Eric Detsi and Neil C. Tomson. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of chemistry, engineering, and materials science. XAFS reveals local structural analysis and collecton information about the unoccupied local electronic states of solid and solution state materials. XAFS is the spectroscopic method of choice for characterizing the structural and electronic properties of new molecules as well as for predicting and explaining resulting reactivity. Spectra reveal information about oxidation state assignments and the degree of covalency in bonding and coordination environments, while allowing for the characterization of bulk material in solid and solution state phases. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions. \r\n\r\nThe award of the XAFS source is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as chemistry, engineering, and materials science. Research focuses on nitrogen activation by iron compounds; precatalysts, oxidized precatalysts, and isolated reaction species for paramagnetic species; and model surface investigations are pursued. In addition, other investigations include nanomaterial preparation and the study of electrochemical energy storage systems involving nanoporous electrodes, and liquid electrodes. It also assists in the use of electrocatalysts for the reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon-containing organic compounds, the characterization of exsolution-synthesized stable and coking-resistant heterogeneous catalysts, exploration of nickel catalyzed carbon-carbon bond forming reactions, and the study of catalytic systems for energy relevant reactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
