 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses a gap in the understanding of mechanistic pathways that lead to the formation of particulate organosulfates in the atmosphere.  Laboratory studies will be conducted to examine the fate of gaseous isoprene epoxydiols and to study how the products of these reactions might alter the properties of atmospheric aerosol.  The results of these studies will help to improve predictions of the formation of secondary organic aerosol in both air quality and climate models.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project include the study of: (1) heterogeneous hydroxyl radical (OH) oxidation of isoprene epoxydiol- (IEPOX) derived low-volatility particulate organosulfates (OSs) to understand how relative humidity (RH), pre-existing aerosol composition (including pH), and OH exposure alter daytime OS composition and physicochemical properties; (2) heterogeneous nitrate (NO3) oxidation of IEPOX-derived OSs to understand how RH, pre-existing aerosol composition (including pH), and NO3 exposure alter nighttime OS composition and physicochemical properties; and (3) cloudwater oxidation experiments to understand how particulate IEPOX-derived OSs recycle inorganic sulfate to yield multifunctional OSs, and thus aqueous secondary organic aerosol (SOA) upon cloud droplet evaporation.\r\n\r\nThis project includes outreach efforts to high school students through the NSF-funded Youth Engaging in the Science of Resilience Program and the NIH-funded 21st Century Environmental Health Scholars Program at the University of North Carolina and through the Detroit Research Internship and Summer Experience (D- RISE) program at the University of Michigan.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
