 "awd_abstract_narration": "The shape of an object can influence a wide variety of data observed for that object.  An important mathematical problem is to determine the extent to which what is observed determines the shape of an object. More generally - what mathematical features of a shape can one determine from the observables?  The principal investigator will study both concrete and abstract problems of this nature.  For example, suppose a particle is enclosed in a polygon and is traveling in a straight line, bouncing off any side it encounters. The shape of the polygon could be inferred by observing the sequences of sides encountered by the particle. The principal investigator will study the extent to which the shape of the region is determined by these observables. More abstract objects studied in these projects involve algebraic systems probed using \"cross-sectional images\" analogous to those recorded by an MRI. These cross-sectional images can be fit together to completely reconstruct an object.  The principal investigator will develop techniques for predicting certain properties without carrying out the reconstruction.  Using these approaches will also allow one to develop problem solving techniques and methods that could find applications in concrete settings.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator will investigate a variety of problems, each of which is connected, either directly or indirectly, to surfaces through geometry, group theory, and dynamics. The research activities are organized into four themes. (1) Studying the large-scale geometry of surface bundles.  The goal is to determine hyperbolicity properties of surface bundles from the geometric data of their associated monodromy representation to the mapping class group.  (2) Probing geometric and dynamical properties of free-by-cyclic groups from the cross section of flows on 2-complexes, and pursuing a fruitful analogy with fundamental groups of surface bundles over the circle. (3) Analyzing singular Euclidean metrics on surfaces and understanding the extent to which the limited data encoded by the support of its associated Liouville current determines the geometry of the metric. This is directly related to studying the extent to which the symbolic dynamics of billiards in polygons determines the shape of the polygon. (4) Studying the geometry at infinity of spaces of structures on a surface, specifically the Teichmueller space, the curve complex, and variants of these spaces.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere were numerous advances in PI's fields of geometry and symmetry (more precisely, geometry, topology, group theory, and dynamics) resulting from the PI's work in this project, which resulted in several publications.  Three of these stand out.\n\nA billiard trajectory in a polygon is the path of a particle, bouncing off the sides so that the angle of refleciton is equal to the angle of incidence.  One of the key outcomes of this project was a proof by the PI and his collaborators (Duchin, Erlandsson, and Sadanand), that the shape of the polygon can generically be determined from the set of sequences of sides encountered by billiard trajectories.  In fact, he and his collaborators gave a complete description of precisely when two polygons can have the same set of \"bounce sequences\".  They also generalized this result to the setting of other geometries, specifically the non-Euclidean setting of hyperbolic geometry.  This work provided new techniques for studying and relating geometry and symbolic dynamics.\n\nHigher dimensional spaces can often be constructed from lower dimensional ones.  Of particular interest are constructing three and higher dimensional objects in terms of surfaces (2-dimensional objects).  These constructions are carried out by \"instructions\" specified by an object called the Mapping Class Group, or more precisely their \"subgroups\".  In the PI's work with his collaborators (Dowdall, Durham, and Sisto) he described how to relate features of certain four dimensional objects to certain special, well-studied subgroups called \"Veech groups\".  This work has paved the way for an all new field of study in the geometric group theory of the mapping class group.\n\nThe PI's work on mapping class groups and his work on geometry in low dimensions has extended to another new area of study in which the surfaces are allowed to be more exotic, namely the so-called \"infinite type\" surfaces.  Here there are special kinds of instructions for assembling three-dimensional spaces called \"end-periodic homeomorphisms\".  In work with his collaborators (Field, Kim, Loving), the PI has made some of the first connections between the classical \"finite type\" analysis of mapping class groups, hyperbolic geometry, and low-dimensional topology via foliations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/12/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher J Leininger"
