 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on the study of carbon fluxes in the Amazon and the influence of human-caused fires on the Amazon carbon cycle.  State-of-the-art models of carbon dioxide (CO2) flux will be used with data from multiple platforms to provide improvements to the understanding of the carbon budget for the Amazon region. The results will be useful for policymakers and researchers to better understand ecosystem responses at multiple timescales and to help identify improved forest management practices.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to explore how biospheric carbon fluxes in an increasingly disturbed Amazon are changing, and whether increased anthropogenic fire activity is becoming a dominant mode of (sub)regional land-atmosphere carbon exchange. The two main hypotheses to be explored in this research are: (1) The Amazon land carbon sink strength is decreasing overall from 2014\u20132020, continuing with the previously identified decreasing trend from the 1990s through 2011; and (2) At annual scales, increased dry-season anthropogenic fire activity is appreciably changing, suggesting that the dominant mode of future (sub)regional land-atmosphere carbon exchange will shift from gross primary productivity (GPP)-dominant to both GPP- and fire-dominant.\r\n\r\nA data-driven biospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) surface flux model, based on the Vegetation, Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM), will be driven with a solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) parameter that is highly correlated with photosynthesis. Newly derived biomass burning emissions of CO will be used in combination with fire CO2/CO emission ratios to estimate variations in the relative importance of fires to the overall biosphere-dominated CO2 signal. Recently acquired data, including CO2 observations and additional ecosystem products from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) will enable the tropical biosphere\u2019s carbon response to climatological variability to be more readily quantified at multiple spatiotemporal scales. The improved CO2 surface flux model for the Amazon developed through this research will help to determine whether atmospheric measurements can be used to gain a top-down understanding of current and future ecosystem responses to both local and global drivers of change.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Determining trends in Amazonia's carbon balance and its sensitivity to disturbance requires reliable vegetation models that adequately capture how its ecosystems exchange carbon with the atmosphere. Our work presents novel estimates of vegetation carbon exchange with the atmosphere across the Amazon, estimated using ground- and satellite-based ecosystem measurements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Amazonia's Net Biome Exchange (NBE), the sum of biogenic and wildfire carbon fluxes, is a fundamental indicator of the state of its ecosystems.&nbsp; It also quantifies the magnitude and patterns of short- and long-term carbon dioxide sources and sinks but is poorly quantified and out of equilibrium (non-zero) due to both direct (deforestation) and indirect (climate-related) anthropogenic disturbance.&nbsp;Determining trends in Amazonia&rsquo;s carbon balance, shifts in carbon exchange pathways of NBE, and timescales of ecosystem sensitivity to disturbance requires reliable biogenic flux models that adequately capture fluxes from diurnal to seasonal and annual timescales. Our study assimilates readily available observations and a derived solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) product to estimate hourly biogenic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) fluxes (mass of CO2 per square meter per second)&nbsp;as Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), and its photosynthesis and respiration constituents, at 12 km resolution&nbsp; (Figure 1) using four versions of a data-driven Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM). The VPRM versions are all calibrated with ground-based eddy flux data and vary based on whether (1) the photosynthesis term incorporates SIF (VPRM_SIF) or traditional surface reflectance (VPRM_TRA) and (2) the respiration term is modified beyond a simple linear air temperature dependence (VPRM_SIFg; VPRM_TRG). We compare the VPRM versions with each other and with hourly fluxes from an independent mechanistic process-based Simple Biosphere 4 (SiB4 v4.2) model. We also use NASA's OCO-2 CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;column observations to optimize the VPRM and SiB4 models during the 2016 wet season which occurred at the tail of the 2015/2016 severe El Nino. The wet season 2016 case study suggests that relative to SiB4 and the SIF-based VPRMs, the traditional VPRM versions can underestimate uptake by a factor of three. &nbsp;In addition, the VPRM_SIFg version better captures biogenic CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>fluxes at hourly to seasonal scales than all other VPRM versions in both anomalously wet and anomalously dry conditions. We also find that the VPRM_SIFg model and the independent bottom-up mechanistic hourly SiB4 model converge in NEE, although there are differences in the partitioning of the photosynthesis and respiration components. We further note that VPRM_SIFg describes greater spatial heterogeneity in carbon exchange throughout the Amazon. Despite the paucity of OCO-2 CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;column observations (XCO<sub>2</sub>) over the Amazon in the wet season, incorporating XCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;into the models significantly reduces near-field model-measurement mismatch at Gatti et al. (2021) aircraft vertical profiling locations; however this is likely because wet season 2016 was an effective \"dry season\" in the regions that influenced the vertical profiling locations (Figure 2). Finally, a qualitative analysis of the unoptimized biogenic models from 2010-2020 agrees with the wet season 2016 case study, where the traditional VPRM formulations significantly underestimate photosynthesis and respiration relative to VPRM-SIFg. Overall, the VPRM_SIFg biogenic flux model shows promise in its ability to capture Amazonian carbon fluxes across multiple timescale and moisture regimes, suggesting its suitability for larger studies evaluating interannual and seasonal carbon trends in fire as well as the biogenic components of the region's NBE (Figure 3).</p>\r\n<p>This project has provided support to two early career&nbsp;female scientists (including the Principal Investigator) while improving research infrastructure in a historically data sparse region that nevertheless has outsized climate importance. The project has successfully initiated ongoing development of promising methods in disentangling Amazonia's ecosystem carbon responses to perturbations.
