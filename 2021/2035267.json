 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aeronomy is a field robustly interdisciplinary and fundamentally dependent upon multi-diagnostic observations and advanced computer modeling capabilities. This proposal describes networks of existing all-sky-imagers (ASIs) and the contributions they can make to some of the outstanding problems in Space Physics. The term \u201cImaging Science\u201d is used to describe the avenues of exploration enabled by actual two-dimensional images of emission, as well as the visualization aspects of data analysis, and the pictoral portrayal of modeling results. The infra-structure required for a team science effort is led by an experienced team of PI and senior staff for instrument operations, observations, data transfer, data management and rapid availability to multiple research communities. The effort is conducted in conjunction with research colleagues and students eager to use new observations to further their studies of Ionosphere-Thermosphere-Mesosphere (ITM) physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere (heights above about 60 miles), the ultraviolet light from the Sun has sufficient energy to separate electrons from atoms and molecules.  This results in an electrically-charged gas of oxygen ions (O+ and O2+) and electrons (e-) that is called the ionosphere (and more generally, a plasma).

Thus studies of the Earth\u2019s ionosphere are both of practical importance (because they govern radio wave propagation, e.g., for GPS navigation), as well as fundamental science of our physical place in the universe.  \nWith support from this grant, Boston University operates a global network of 12 optical observatories with instruments that observe the ionosphere using wide-angle (all-sky) fields of view.  These instruments capture ionospheric structure and dynamics in three latitude zones:  sub-auroral, mid-latitude, and equatorial domains in two longitude regions (north/south America) and Europe/Africa.  The locations of these instruments are at so-called conjugate points---places where the Earth\u2019s magnetic field extends from one site (e.g., Asiago, Italy) to the other (Sutherland, South Africa).  This Boston University observing network is a unique capability world-wide and our investigations are at the forefront of \"conjugate point science\" in the near-Earth environment.
