 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical\r\n\r\nThe 2018 National Quantum Initiative Act recognized the importance of strategic, federally coordinated support for quantum information sciences and engineering (QISE) research to maintain economic competitiveness, sustain national security, and fuel transformative scientific advancement. This immediately accelerated the pace of an already rapidly advancing field and, consequently, surged the demands for trained quantum engineers. To satisfy these workforce needs and remain globally competitive, the U.S. must train an increasing number of quantum engineers and scientists. This requires reaching beyond the existing pipelines and providing equal resources to a broader range of communities.  Success relies on recognizing the critical role and understanding the barriers faced by Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), which train a disproportionately large number of underrepresented students who earn bachelor's degrees in STEM fields. To this end, a series of workshops entitled Supporting Minority Serving Institutions in the Creation of a Diverse, Quantum-Ready Workforce have been designed to prescribe a strategy to help broaden participation in QISE.  Topics include identifying quantum workforce needs, protocols to gain access to nationwide facilities offering specialized equipment for quantum research, development of specialized quantum courses and academic programs, and opportunities to develop strategic partnerships with industry.\r\n\r\nTechnical\r\n\r\nThis workshop series is designed to facilitate quantum information science and engineering (QISE) research and educational programs at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). The series consists of two two-day workshops, which are scheduled for October 2021 (virtual, hosted by the Colorado School of Mines) and February 2022 (hosted in San Juan, PR by the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez). Engaging ~80 QISE researchers from universities, industry, and national labs nationwide, the goal of these events is to cultivate innovative ideas for bolstering MSI participation and success in QISE through a combination of invited talks and guided breakout group discussion sessions.  This is achieved by first identifying strengths and obstacles faced by MSIs that hinder their participation in QISE as well as mechanisms to boost the number of quantum scientists from underrepresented groups by means of raising the research competitiveness of MSIs. To this end, activities also include advertising specialized resources: proposal-writing training opportunities, quantum computing facilities, and nationwide user facilities for growth, fabrication, and measurement of quantum devices.  The first workshop provides seed funding to select groups who present competitive, innovative plans to achieve these goals; these groups subsequently report on their progress during the second meeting. Outcomes include implementation of several new initiatives and a whitepaper summarizing the unearthed barriers and prescribing novel activities to fuel sustained increases in the participation of underrepresented minorities in QISE.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The workshop gathered 69 participants from 46 institutions, where 27 institutions are MSIs. The second in-person workshop was held at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC), Washington, DC on July 12-13, 2023. This workshop gathered 48 participants from 26 educational institutions, 20 of which were Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and from 11 Companies. The goal of this workshop was to support Minority Serving Institutions in quantum research and educational endeavors, and we reached nearly uniform participation of MSI institutions across the US.&nbsp; The workshops created a very important environment for interdisciplinary dialogue, making a unique forum for researchers, educators, and ambassadors from different areas of the in quantum information science and engineering (QISE) field (quantum industry, materials, computer science, engineering, chemistry, mathematics, and physics) to exchange new ideas and to engage a broader set of MSI institutions and individuals into the Quantum field.</p>\r\n<p>The workshops were targeted on how to build Quantum-Ready Workforce with long-term vision and benefits by identifying big ideas for the creation of new QISE education and research programs at MSIs, via fostering strong collaborations with NSF, NIST, DOE National Labs, nationwide user facilities, and Quantum centers. Industry opportunities in QISE and how the industry can meet quantum workforce needs were discussed. There was recognized the important role of MSIs, which train a disproportionately large number of underrepresented students who earn bachelor's degrees in STEM fields, in achieving these goals:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Help industry meet quantum workforce needs. Advertise industry opportunities in QISE.</li>\r\n<li>Advertise educational resources (including experimental toolkits) to assist with starting new courses,</li>\r\n<li>Discuss new educational QISE programs, and</li>\r\n<li>Advertise and discuss QISE funding opportunities for MSIs.</li>\r\n<li>Flourishing programs</li>\r\n<li>Nascent programs</li>\r\n<li>Brainstorm how to start programs (a new research effort, specialized course, new degree/certificate, seminar series, internships)</li>\r\n<li>Identify resource needs</li>\r\n<li>Generate novel ideas on how to attain resources or mitigate barriers</li>\r\n<li>Form strategic partnerships (e.g. can large institutions offer specialized courses to smaller ones?)</li>\r\n<li>Provide information to funding agencies regarding resource needs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The Panels and Group Discussions helped participants to identify specific needs and solutions to reach these goals. The workshop provided special training for researchers from Minority Serving Institutions to build groundbreaking research programs in QISE. The workshop's interactive sessions included not only expert-led presentations but also dedicated breakout sessions, where participants engaged in collaborative discussions. A flexible interactive discussion platform of the meetings helped to cultivate innovative ideas for bolstering MSI participation and success in QISE through the combination of invited talks and guided small group breakout discussion sessions.&nbsp; This helped to identify strengths and obstacles faced by MSIs that hinder their participation in the quantum workforce. Also, participants received special training in proposal writing. One workshop group with the best competitive and innovative proposal was funded.</p>\r\n<p>This workshop program identified key expertise and routes to specialized experimental and theoretical training as well as education in areas such as the following: novel quantum materials, strong correlations, topological phases, nanofabrication, and cryogenic measurement of quantum devices, and APIs (application programming interface) for quantum computers. A comprehensive understanding of the Quantum-Ready Workforce was achieved through keen analyses of MSIs' potential contributions and competitive edge in quantum research. This was augmented by informed discussions related to the NSF's Quantum Leap initiative and DOE&rsquo;s Quantum Programs, thereby offering invaluable insights into the optimal ways to integrate highly skilled engineers and students specializing in quantum information science. The workshop emphasized a multi-faceted approach, including fostering academic collaborations to elevate the QISE research competitiveness at MSIs, as well as implementing innovative initiatives to ensure long-term engagement and participation in QISE.</p>\r\n<p>These workshops contributed to the development of targeted outreach strategies to engage younger demographics, specifically middle and high school students. The consensus was that early exposure to Quantum Information Science is not only feasible but also vital for deep training a diverse talent pool. To this end, the workshop discussed the integration of quantum-focused curricula at pre-college levels, enabled by collaborative programs offering hands-on quantum laboratory experiences. These educational initiatives aim to make Quantum Information Science accessible and captivating for younger students, laying a robust foundation for their future participation in this rapidly evolving field.</p>\r\n<p>The workshop materials (slides and videos) are available on the workshop website <a href=\"https://quantum.mines.edu/nsf-msi-schedule/\">https://quantum.mines.edu/nsf-msi-schedule/</a>.
