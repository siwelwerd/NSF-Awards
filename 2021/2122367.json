 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and measure the efficacy of a Culturally Relevant Pedagogical Framework for Computer Science and Computational Thinking (CRPF-CSCT). Students from groups underrepresented in computer science (CS) will provide input and participate in developing the framework. The development team will consist of six students, six high school teachers (CS and non-CS), and five research team members. The framework will be designed over a year and guided by collaborative dialogues, a form of structured discussion where participants work together to identify and develop positive change.  Once completed, the framework is intended for use in computer science courses to improve retention. Teachers in other subjects can also use the framework to introduce high school students to computational thinking (CT) across the curriculum. The framework will be designed to encourage inclusivity and collaboration, making the classroom experience more welcoming for all.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will use mixed methods to identify how key challenges and barriers to studying CS are perceived and experienced by students from underrepresented groups in CS. The project team will develop an instrument to quantitatively measure perceptions and attitudes toward computer science in high school students. The team will also develop specific approaches to improve the teaching and learning of CS and CT for all students. External evaluation will ensure that all project goals are achieved, and student voices remain central to the process. Results from the project directly address issues of broadening participation in computing through early and ongoing involvement by students from underrepresented groups and through the development of the framework itself. The research is intended to provide a more welcoming environment in computer science for girls, underrepresented students of color, and students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, at a young age as they are first beginning to consider career options seriously.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the CS for All: Research and RPPs program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
