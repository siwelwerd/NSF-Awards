 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to commercialize an effective, point-of-care, colorectal cancer cell detection test. Colorectal cancer (CRC) was the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States in 2020. This novel test will provide a non-invasive, fast, and accurate method to detect CRC that will not only impact the lives of individual patients, but also significantly reduce healthcare costs. If commercially viable, the proposed no-label/real-time colorectal cancer biosensor will also contribute to new scientific and engineering findings in biosensing technology, which is currently projected to be a $20 billion market. The resulting device may serve as a CRC test for preclinical diagnosis. In addition, the research based on the microchip biosensors may improve a range of equivalent studies that use similar systems and biomarkers. Hispanic students and postdoctoral fellows will have the opportunity to learn the basic concepts of entrepreneurship and innovation through this project.\r\n \r\nThe proposed project seeks to systematically develop an understanding of the need and commercial viability of a point-of-care diagnostic technology for the sensitive detection of colorectal cancer cells in real-time. The proposed technology utilizes electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for the detection of specific colorectal cancer biomarkers by a means of surface sensitive electrochemical events occurring at the interface of a conductive, interdigital graphene/gold based microchip. The proposed method combines the recognized sensitivity of electrochemical sensing platforms and the well-known specificity of exclusive biomarker probes, to provide a sensor solution with the needed portability, reliability, speed, and accuracy required to achieve early colorectal cancer detection for point-of-care testing (e.g. primary care doctor\u2019s office). Moreover, this project allows for the necessary measurements and studies required to mature the techniques to move towards commercialization and prototypes for technology demonstration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
