 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the abundances and properties of elements within the Solar System.  The investigators will update and refine so-called \u201csolar abundances,\u201d which are a fundamental reference for determining the properties of gas and dust in space.  Results from the study will allow astronomers to accurately interpret observations of a variety of stellar environments and understand how chemistry influences the formation of stars and planets. This project will train a graduate student and provide research opportunities for undergraduate students.  Results from the project are expected to be integrated into textbooks, and they will be broadly applicable to physical sciences besides astrophysics. \r\n\r\nThis work seeks to provide a fundamental framework for interpreting abundances and chemical compositions of gas and dust in stellar environments.  The researchers will undertake a detailed assessment of elemental and isotopic compositions of all chondritic meteorites and their components to evaluate and model apparent differences in abundance between the solar photosphere and rare \u201cCI chondrites.\u201d  They will then use thermochemical models of gas and condensation chemistry to address the apparent abundance variations of refractory elements between the Sun and other G-type stars.  The project is expected to result in a significant update to the Solar System elemental and isotopic abundance reference set derived from meteoritic and solar data.  It will also complement spectroscopic studies of the atmospheres and circumstellar shells of evolved stars, as well as the analysis of presolar grains isolated from meteorites.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
