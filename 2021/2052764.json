 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Arkansas, University of Tennessee, and Florida International University have established the Center for High-Frequency Electronics and Circuits for Communication Systems (CHECCS), an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC). The efforts at the three universities will provide cooperative opportunities to develop new research knowledge to support U.S. competitiveness in  wireless communications technologies, including 5G/6G and beyond. CHECCS addresses the potential to increase accessibility to high-frequency circuits and communication-system services. The center\u2019s research will be seamlessly integrated with educational activities, and findings will be incorporated into courses for training undergraduate and graduate students. The center is also committed to broadening participation of underrepresented groups. Underrepresented faculty, graduate and undergraduate students will be actively recruited by each site to work on and participate in the center\u2019s research and educational activities including outreach events. \r\n\r\nThe technical area of high-frequency devices, circuits and communication systems is critically important to U.S. industry, its economy, and national security. CHECCS\u2019 mission is in developing different levels of integrated components for future multi-scale systems on a single chip. CHECCS brings strength and expertise from a wide range of disciplines to significantly advance knowledge and bridge the gap between universities and industry. The research areas cover a broad range of disciplines from electrical engineering, to computer engineering, materials science, transportation, and physics. The center will work closely with industry and government agencies in addressing multidisciplinary research challenges  by combining knowledge from participating research groups and creating a culture that links engineering research to technological innovation. This linkage will be achieved through sustained partnerships with industry/practitioner organizations and technology transfer offices. Core strengths of CHECCS include a dynamic team that has both academic and industry research experience, with emphasis on comprehensive electromagnetic modeling, monolithic microwave and millimeter-wave integrated circuits, radiofrequency high-power components and systems, antenna design, and digital and analog circuit design up to terahertz frequency. The team has access to advanced fabrication, testing, and high-performance computational resources, as well as strong ties to industry that will enable refinement of the research areas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
