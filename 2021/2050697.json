 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Keck Geology Consortium REU will offer undergraduate research experiences for 14 undergraduate students per year to help students: (1) improve their understanding of the earth through authentic research; (2) develop disciplinary and personal skills needed by professional earth scientists; (3) develop their confidence and identity as scientists through greater understanding of the intellectual and practical work of science; and (4) refine their career plans and prepare them for graduate study using intentionally designed research experiences and mentoring. Gateway projects, designed for rising sophomores, will engage students in a mix of field and laboratory work to investigate societally relevant questions, expose them to the breadth of the discipline, and to career opportunities in the earth sciences. Students in the Advanced Research Program (rising juniors) will participate in a four-week summer project involving a mix of field and laboratory investigations, followed by an academic year-long project at their home campuses, that focuses on important problems in the discipline. Both programs include analytical, professional development components, and conference presentations designed to help students learn cutting-edge approaches, as well as to develop their professional knowledge and skills. Mentor workshops, curricular materials, and technology are used to support the work of student participants and project mentors.\r\n\r\nThe principal goal of Keck Geology Consortium programs is to broaden the diversity of the geoscience workforce and to prepare students for careers in the geosciences. Undergraduate participants, especially those from underrepresented minorities, will be recruited from both Consortium and non-Consortium institutions. The Gateway Program is designed to further existing efforts at the Consortium institutions to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups within the geosciences and STEM. With an emphasis on year-long research experiences, structured research curricula, and mentor training, the Consortium programs provide a distinctive model for undergraduate research. This project also endeavors to advance the evaluation of undergraduate research experiences with further development of a research knowledge and skill survey and to facilitate community-wide engagement with \u201cscience identity\u201d formation with a goal of simultaneously strengthening REU\u2019s and geoscience programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
