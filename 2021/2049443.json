 "awd_abstract_narration": "International actors, such as international organizations, non-governmental organizations, as well as state actors, intervene in those internal conflicts in a variety of ways, altering the conflict dynamics with implications for human security. Under what conditions are international interventions effective in reducing militant violence? The integrative international interventions (Triple-i) project examines the humanitarian consequences of various international intervention policies in reducing militant violence. The issues of violence against civilians, violence against women, and violence against children are the center of the inquiry. The project has three objectives: 1) to identify intervention opportunities and challenges to human security in conflict zones, 2) to develop an integrative theory of international interventions for human security, and 3) to test and measure the efficacy of various measures dealing with militant violence around the world. The PIs collect data for the variety of international intervention efforts and militant group characteristics and analyze the patterns of approximately 1,200 militant groups\u2019 violence in about 120 countries around the world between 1990 and 2020. The comprehensive and systematic assessment of costs, benefits, and associated risks of intervention measures is part of the analysis. Time-series intervention analysis will be used to evaluate the choice and efficacy of intervention measures.\r\n\r\nThe PIs develop an integrative framework to study the choice and efficacy of various international intervention measures, develops a categorization for the conditions of engaging militants, the implementation of a measurement strategy of militant adaptability, and a coding strategy for major international interventions.  Broader Impacts include a sharable database that will be available to academics and policy makers and training for undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
