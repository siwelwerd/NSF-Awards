 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will expand the analytical capabilities of the University of Cincinnati (UC) UC Stable Isotope Laboratory by adding new instrumentation to measure the stable hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) isotopic compositions of waters and solid organics. In the past few years, the research of the UC Stable Isotope Laboratory has included more focus on the hydrologic cycle and tracking the foraging habits and mobility patterns of animals over time. This work requires measurements of H and O isotopes of waters and tissues containing proteins. Expanded in-house analytical abilities made possible by this award will support and strengthen the established research programs at our laboratory as well as make possible anticipated research directions in the areas of paleoclimatology, conservation biology, paleoecology, and organic geochemistry research. H and O isotopes in water are commonly used to address a wide array of topics in the geosciences, such as characterization of the hydrologic cycle, measuring evaporation and transpiration in plants, as well as evaporation in surface waters and soils, identifying water vapor and precipitation source, and investigating groundwater infiltration and mixing. Past records of the hydrologic cycle can be generated from proxies that indirectly record precipitation and surface water H and O. Combined, these new analytical directions will improve paleo-hydrologic reconstructions and future predictions of hydrologic change. A more complete understanding of the hydrological cycle is critical for safeguarding national health, prosperity, and welfare. Additionally, H and O isotopes in organic animal tissues can be used to track foraging behavior and movement patterns of both living and historic fauna. This information complements that provided by other isotopes like carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), as well as more traditional methods for obtaining geographical information (e.g., banding or satellite-tracking individuals). Surprisingly little is known about individual mobility or population connectivity for many highly mobile and migratory animal species (e.g., birds, butterflies), and even less is known about how stable these patterns are over time. Given the rate and scale of anthropogenic changes to most of our planet\u2019s surface, obtaining such data is increasingly urgent. \r\n\r\nThe UC Stable Isotope Laboratory currently houses two isotope ratio mass spectrometers with the ability to analyze C and N of bulk organics, C and H of specific compounds (e.g., leaf wax n-alkanes), C and O of carbonates, C and H of atmospheric methane, and H and O of water, but with poor precision. However, there are no capabilities to measure H and O of organic solids. This award will add a high temperature elemental analyzer for the analysis of H and O of solids, including organic tissues (e.g., chitin, keratin and cellulose), and provide analysis of H and O of waters with high precision. This new instrumentation will also greatly increase sample throughput and lower labor demands. It will also provide novel hands-on analytical training in three established geology classes that serve undergraduate and graduate students taught by the investigators, as well as additional analytical opportunities to support undergraduate and graduate student research. This instrument acquisition will continue to support the strong record of mentoring students (particularly women) and providing research opportunities to students both at UC and other institutions, including primarily undergraduate institutions. Lastly, the requested instrumentation will play a critical role in expanding undergraduate capstone experiences within the UC Geology Department as part of current efforts to improve program equity and inclusion. This award will support one female PhD student and the proposed work will directly support two undergraduate student research projects to develop and test standards and methods for the new equipment. The PIs will expand their existing public engagement programs on climate change by developing a science outreach program in collaboration with Geology graduate students. The initial target venue will be a local Farmer\u2019s Market that serves a diverse urban community, but it is anticipated that the program will evolve and expand with new cohorts of graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
