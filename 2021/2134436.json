 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nThe 2021 Campus Cyberinfrastructure Workshop builds upon the success of the previous Campus Cyberinfrastructure Workshops providing an opportunity for recipients of all active NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) awards to meet in-person, exchange project findings, interact with national cyberinfrastructure experts and collaborate across project areas and project regions. Due to the on-going pandemic, the 2021 PI workshop will be conducted virtually.  The advantage of conducting a virtual workshop is the flexibility of the virtual environment for broader participation of additional CC* award project collaborators such as co-PIs, researchers, and other campus representatives to participate in workshop conversations without the additional time demands and travel expenses for participation.   The workshop program will encourage interactions among the PIs with the broader R&E community through invited participation of cyberinfrastructure experts and representatives from regional and national networks.  As demonstrated before, the broader scope encourages relationships between campus cyberinfrastructure, science driven applications, and regional and national cyberinfrastructure resources.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the interaction between national cyberinfrastructure experts, exchange of project findings and collaboration across project areas and regions, all of which will lead to the new ideas, relationships, and collaborations associated with a focused workshop. The workshop breakout sessions will provide the opportunity for program PIs and co-PIs to gain exposure to other cyberinfrastructure technologies or resources. The workshop furthers the development of cross-discipline, regional, and national collaborations on cyberinfrastructure to support science research and education applications. By including awardees from all areas of the CC* programs, the workshop facilitates interaction and collaboration between research intensive and under-resourced colleges and universities, as well as different cyberinfrastructure program areas, in ways that would not otherwise occur.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe workshop was conducted virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic over the course of 4 days spanning two weeks.  There was no workshop in 2020 so most participants in the workshop (88%) were first-time attendees of the workshop.  Total workshop attendance was 162 people.   This included 14 guest representatives from national cyberinfrastructure resources and 148 PIs or project staff associated with 93 different CC* awards and representing 130 different organizations/institutions.  While the preference is to meet in-person, the virtual environment allowed for more project staff, collaborators, and researchers to attend without the time and expense of travel.  A virtual pre-workshop session was conducted in early September and targeted new PIs and other collaborators of CC* planning and CC* CIRA awards.  The pre-session focused on providing an overview of what participants could expect during the main workshop and prepared them to maximize opportunities with national cyberinfrastructure experts during the workshop to get assistance and information specific to their own projects.\n\nSimilar to past CC* PI workshops, the most tangible outcomes of the 2021 PI workshop are the availability of workshop content including presentations, notes, and other supplemental materials hosted online as a resource for project PIs, staff, and collaborators as well as the broader cyberinfrastructure community.  The most important outcomes of the event were the exchange of information, interactions with project peers across the country, and the sharing of project findings and lessons learned throughout the formal presentations and breakout discussions.  Additional outcomes of the workshop for participants include exposure and access to; national and regional cyberinfrastructure resources to support individual CC* project goals, cyberinfrastructure tools and applications, data movement and measurement techniques, common challenges in infrastructure deployment, and research engagement facilitation techniques. \n\nOne of the highlights of the workshop was the closing plenary delivered by Alan Blatecky of the Research Triangle Institute.
