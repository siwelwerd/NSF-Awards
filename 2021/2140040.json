NDSS brings together innovative and forward-thinking members of the Internet community who research, design, develop, and deploy the technologies that define network and distributed system security. This grant enables career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen graduate students. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school education for our society's future computer security researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer security researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers. In the pandemic era, virtual attendance at conferences is crucial for jump-starting academic careers, and this award helps in that direction.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
