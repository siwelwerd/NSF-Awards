 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to partially support 18 undergraduate students, graduate students, post-docs, and under-represented, female, junior and retired faculty to attend and present at the symposium on Quantum and Nanomaterials at the Spring Materials Research Society (MRS) national meeting in Seattle, Washington, April 18-23, 2021. The main focus of this symposium is to discuss the advanced state-of-the-art experimental tools and theoretical calculations used to manipulate and detect the physical properties (magnetic, superconducting, structural, opto-electronics, etc.) of quantum materials, heterostructures and devices, particularly, on the atomically thin crystals, whose response is exceedingly difficult to detect by employing conventional bulk techniques. This meeting is the world's foremost international scientific gathering for materials research, the MRS meeting showcases leading interdisciplinary research in both fundamental and applied areas, coordinated by scientists from both academia and industry in many countries around the world.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
