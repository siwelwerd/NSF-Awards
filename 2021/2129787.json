 "awd_abstract_narration": "Living organisms are strongly shaped by both ecological and evolutionary forces. Because ecological and evolutionary processes are constantly interacting, it can be difficult to fully understand their effects on the biology of organisms. Eco-evolutionary dynamics theory provides a powerful framework for understanding interactions between ecology and evolution on contemporary time scales. The Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network, which was launched in 1980 and has over two dozen geographic research sites, has rich historical and contemporary data for many species across a diversity of biomes. Importantly, many LTER sites are embedded in urbanizing landscapes, where eco-evolutionary dynamics may be particularly strong.\r\n \r\nThere is a need to bring together scholars with research expertise in urban eco-evolutionary dynamics and LTER researchers to (i) integrate LTER approaches and the eco-evolutionary dynamics framework in an explicitly urban context, and (ii) train future LTER eco-evolutionary dynamics researchers in an integrative science approach. The intention of this project is to develop research initiatives that promote inclusion and equity while advancing the science of ecology and evolutionary biology. Two workshops will be hosted to meet these goals. Anticipated outcomes include the preparation of several manuscripts that summarize data synthesis activities and outline the future of eco-evolutionary research at LTER sites. Another outcome is the formation of new hypotheses about the effects of urbanization on eco-evolutionary dynamics across the LTER network to stimulate plans for future collaborative and transformative research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
