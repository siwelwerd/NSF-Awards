 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most metallic materials are polycrystalline in nature and behave as aggregate composites of single crystals as the basic building block. Metallic materials generally deform elastically by atomic bond distortion or plastically by atomic bond rearrangement. Plastic deformation takes place by the mechanisms of dislocation motion and deformation twinning. Dislocations are atom sized features which move by applied stress and have been relatively well studied and are described by many advanced theories. Deformation twins are single crystal sized features and are not well understood or represented by theories of deformation. This award supports fundamental study of deformation twinning and overcoming limitations to modeling of this plasticity mechanism. The new knowledge and computational capability will have a broad range of applications to advanced manufacturing, structure survivability, and transportation. In addition, the project will support the education of graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of computational micromechanics, materials science, and crystal plasticity. The collaborative nature of the award will also afford the students the opportunity to engage across the two campuses.\r\n\r\nPlasticity in metallic materials is mediated by both dislocation slip and deformation twinning. The disparity in characteristic length between the two mechanisms is a limitation to crystal plasticity finite element simulation of polycrystals as deformation twins cannot be represented by volume average. The objective of this project is to develop a computational framework for the explicit representation of deformation twins based upon an embedded weak discontinuity technique. The embedded weak discontinuity is driven by single crystal theory which accounts for twin nucleation, propagation, and growth within a consistent thermodynamic and physical basis. Dislocation slip will also be represented with a thermally activated based theory and will allow slip to occur in both twinned and untwinned regions. The interaction of dislocations with the twin boundaries will also be modelled during the twin growth phase. This project will focus upon the model material of high-purity titanium. Validation experiments will be conducted on large grain samples to allow for detailed characterization. These deformation experiments will be conducted at different initial temperatures and sample temperatures will be measured during deformation to evaluate the model prediction of the Taylor-Quinney factor.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

When mechanically deformed, polycrystalline metallic materials will respond by elastic and plastic deformation of the single crystals. The physical mechanisms of plastic deformation are most commonly dislocation slip and deformation twinning. Dislocations are created by faults in the way in which atoms are arranged within the single crystals and take the form of closed loops in the material which move when the applied stress is large enough. This involves a complex process of breaking and reforming atomic bonds in the material which also dissipates some of the imposed mechanical energy. Deformation twinning is distinctly different from dislocation slip. Deformation twins are not defects in the material as are dislocations, but rather follow a nucleation, propagation, and growth evolutionary process with deformation. Deformation twins are currently understood to most likely form from high intensity dislocation accumulations at high stress spots in the material. Once a twin nucleus has been formed, the stored energy of that nucleus creates a very thin deformation twin which propagates across the single crystal. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 with deformation twins shown as thin bands within single crystals. With further deformation these twins widen by movement of the twin boundaries on both sides of the twin band. Inside the twin band, the crystal experiences rotation and shear deformation. Deformation twinning also dissipates imposed deformation energy and together with dislocation slip this takes the form of increasing the temperature of the material while some energy is stored in the material as elastic strain energy in the crystal lattice.</p>\r\n<p>Performing direct numerical simulations of polycrystalline aggregates has become commonplace amongst materials researchers and industry. When we wish to perform direct numerical simulations of the deformation behavior of polycrystalline aggregates using computational tools such as the finite element method, it is challenging to properly resolve the complex process of nucleation, propagation, and growth of deformation twins. Fig. 2 provides an example of a computational model used to simulate the deformation behavior of a metallic polycrystalline aggregate. As the images in Fig. 1 illustrate, representing the formation and size evolution of deformation twins requires a special treatment. This project has developed a new numerical technique and computational framework to represent deformation twins explicitly within crystal plasticity finite element simulations of polycrystal aggregates during deformation. This computational framework uses a newly developed element formulation which represents a deformation twin as a displacement discontinuity within a single element &ndash; often termed as an enriched element formulation. Once a deformation twin has propagated into the crystal, the twin is able to grow with deformation and expand beyond the bounds of the original crystal into which it was embedded. This computational framework employs new physical theories of both dislocation slip and twin nucleation, propagation, and growth to enable physically based simulation of the comprehensive deformation process.</p>\r\n<p>This new computational framework was developed to explicitly represent deformation twinning in models such as those displayed in Fig. 2. Large deformation kinematics is employed, and the computational framework is integrated in time by an implicit Newton-type time integration procedure within the explicit branch of the commercial finite element solver ABAQUS. A probabilistic twin nucleation model is used to represent the nucleation of deformation twins at grain boundaries. Results of a simulation showing locations of twin nucleation within an eight grain polycrystal model is shown in Fig. 3. Once nucleated at a grain boundary, a twin is propagated into the grain at a speed determined by a velocity which is represented by a new model for twin boundary velocity as a function of stress conditions and temperature. The computational framework accounts for both first law and second law thermodynamics and accounts for the stored energy of cold work due to change of dislocation density and internal stress state due to twins. Simple compression experiments were performed on high-purity titanium at different strain rates and different initial temperatures. These experiments were used to determine material parameters for titanium in the computational framework and provide results for model validation. Results of a simulation of an eight grain polycrystal model are shown in Fig. 4.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/19/2025<br>\nModified by: Curt&nbsp;Allan&nbsp;Bronkhorst</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2051355/2051355_10751382_1745094139228_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2051355/2051355_10751382_1745094139228_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2051355/2051355_10751382_1745094139228_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Evolution of deformation twins as a function of total strain magnitude in the model.
