 "awd_abstract_narration": "Millennials are now the largest generation in the American workforce, and their influence on the economy is growing. This project investigates whether and how employment practices in the finance and insurance industries shape where Millennials want to work. Existing research suggests that practices designed to make workplaces more hospitable to a varied workforce may be of particular importance to Millennials. This research considers whether Millennials\u2019 assessments of these practices influence whether they accept a job offer. A critical component of the research will explore the challenges faced by various demographic groups in the workplace, and the extent to which corporate practices address their concerns. Findings from the project will help companies to attract and retain a pipeline of young talent, who can fuel innovation and ensure the health and longevity of U.S. industry. \r\n\r\nThe project will conduct in-depth, open-ended interviews with 60 workers aged 23-37 in the finance and insurance sectors in New York and North Carolina. From a set of known initial participants, snowball sampling will be used to locate additional respondents from varied backgrounds. Interviews will take place via telephone, over the web, and in person. This project provides an opportunity to hire, train, and work with students of varied backgrounds, who will assist with all stages of the research process. The research will lay the foundation for a better understanding of how young workers make decisions about where to work. The findings will inform sociological theories of work and aging.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
