 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to contribute to a more just and equitable society in the future by encouraging teachers to identify, reflect on, and correct revealed biases. This three-year project will implement a scalable model for developing equitable, culturally responsive teaching practices through a simulated teaching environment. The project will identify best practices to help teachers recognize and mitigate implicit biases that often impact student success. Bias reduction in teaching practices is crucial for enabling future leaders to achieve their highest innate and positively nurtured potential. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted disparities in learning and emphasized the importance of socio-emotional stability for the long-term well-being of students and teachers. \r\n\r\nThe project team will iteratively develop and test a Teaching without Bias curriculum and add an AI-driven set of bias reduction tools to existing simulation instruction modules. The project will use data-driven decisions to confirm the feasibility of a three-phase approach to reducing bias in teaching. Through a randomized-assignment experimental design, the project will also confirm whether any of the three phases alone, in sequence, or in combination, is most effective. Through a simulated teaching environment, the project outcomes will lead to a model for developing equitable, culturally responsive teaching practices. The project will use the simulated teaching environment to develop and refine computational models that lead to improved teaching practices and contribute to the learning sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Refinements in the data gathered in a simulated environment allowed researchers to assess changes in teaching practices related to bias and equity based on targeted feedback to real teachers using the simulation system. Findings from teacher data over the three-years of the project revealed significant and educationally meaningful positive changes in measured indices related to equitable and culturally responsive teaching practices following experiences in the simSchool online simulated teaching environment. Specifically, positive changes included: a) teacher efficacy related to instructional strategies, classroom management and student engagement, b) culturally responsive teaching strategies based on cultural awareness, c) developing positive classroom community, d) addressing individual learning needs, e) educator bias related to self-awareness, and f) pedagogical environment and relationships with families and community.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students of the teachers who participated in the simulated teaching environment were also impacted by the project. Data from 822 grade 3 &ndash; 12 students of teachers who completed the simEquity simulated teaching intervention reported significant (<em>p</em> &lt;.05) pre-post increases in: a) their voice having influence, b) diverse teaching practices by their teachers, and c) the level of engagement respondents felt as students. Student engagement, cultural identity and voice in school have been shown to have measurable influences on student learning.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data collected based on actions within the simulator included the use of benchmarks for teaching standards. The system recorded instances of pedagogical practices as educators completed each trial &ndash; based on a standardized teacher observation tool. The results showed positive improvements in teaching benchmarks related to equitable teaching practices. This finding supports one of the primary goals of the simEquity project &ndash; to increase the use of equitable teaching practices as measured through a simulated teaching environment.&nbsp; While the goal of classroom observations is to improve teacher quality, the feedback often lacks the richness that drives changes to be made. Using simulated observations as one of the tools of teacher improvement allows specific feedback based on observable behaviors. The unobtrusive observation provided by the simulation feedback allows reflection of results, with specified feedback for improvement in subsequent practice sessions.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other data collected within the simulator based on actions of the teachers using the system were related to instructional practices based on student learning needs. Analysis of a measure of accommodation effectiveness revealed that educators teaching within the simulator tended to increase attention (<em>p</em> &lt; .05) in the areas where they perceived the greatest needs. Targeted focus from teachers increased toward the simulated students whose profiles indicated special learning needs, and who exhibited learning behaviors indicative of students having special learning needs. Findings provided credible evidence of the authenticity of the simulated teaching environment as perceived by actual teachers, in that teachers&rsquo; actions in the simulator were comparable to the manner in which high quality teachers commonly focus guidance in real classrooms, targeting extra assistance where they perceive it is needed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><strong>Intellectual Merit. </strong>Identification of effective methods for equitable and culturally responsive teaching practices was one primary goal of the project. Finding remediation solutions that can be applied on a broad scale for teachers throughout the nation is a key foundation for enabling every future member of society to achieve their highest innate and nurtured potential. Analyses of data gathered over the three years of the simEquity project confirmed significant and educationally meaningful positive changes in measured indices related to equitable and culturally responsive teaching practices resulted from simulated teaching experiences in the simSchool online environment. The simEquity project has demonstrated that simulations of classroom teaching can accelerate reflections and refinements in the science of teaching and learning.

Given the need to prepare more equitable and culturally responsive teachers, simSchool is likely to continue to expand to meet the demands of teacher development programs, with scalability facilitated by ease of access from any location with a computing device, web browser and Internet connection. The recognized importance of quality teachers for the preparation of future productive citizens of our society has spotlighted the urgency of research such as that completed in the <em>simEquity</em> project with its focus on mitigation of implicit bias.
