The project investigated the effects of contextual and other characteristics on hate crime victimization and reporting. Our findings clearly demonstrate the nuanced relationships between context and hate crime victimization and reporting. For example, our results revealed a nonlinear, bell-shaped effect of the percent Black on the risk of racial hate crime victimization. We also observed that percent Hispanic had a nonlinear, bell-shaped effect on hate crime victimization based on ethnicity or nationality. These effects are also region-specific. Additionally, we found that the risk of hate crime victimization is higher in places with a higher percentage of Whites experiencing an influx of the Black population, and with higher levels of residential instability and ethnic heterogeneity. We also reported some interesting contextual effects on hate crime motivated by sexual orientation, disability, perceived religion. Our results indicated that the effects of contextual variables diverge by race, ethnicity, and gender of the victim. Finally, our results showed that the relationship between the race of the offender and the race of the victim matters when predicting the risk of hate crime victimization, and that historical and socio-economic context can influence this relationship.
