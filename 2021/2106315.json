 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Stephen Maldonado of the University of Michigan is merging a diverse set of approaches and tools to develop nanostructures that are composed of multiple metals. These intermetallic nanostructures are synthesized using electrochemical reactions performed in nanoscale liquid metal droplets. Control over electrochemical parameters allows for tunable programming of both composition and structure. In addition, the synthesis of two-dimensional materials at liquid metal interfaces under electrochemical control is being explored for the development of an alternative synthetic toolbox for synthesizing intermetallic nanostructures. Through this research, students are learning how to synthesize and characterize nanostructures without disturbing the reaction. Dr. Maldonado continues to engage and educate the broader community through K-12 activities as well as through the development of digital content related to electrochemistry and nanoscience.\r\n \r\nThis research focuses on advancing the mechanistic understanding and synthetic scope of the electrochemical liquid-liquid-solid (ec-LLS) process for the formation of intermetallic crystalline, nanostructures. Two key developments are being targeted. First, the ec-LLS method is being explored for the synthesis of two-dimensional Pb crystals (e.g. plumbene) through characterization by X-ray reflectivity. Second, in-situ liquid electrochemical transmission electron microscopy is employed to record individual intermetallic nanoparticle growth events by ec-LLS. Researchers involved in this work are trained in electrochemistry, materials, metallurgy, nanoscience, solid-state chemistry, X-ray reflectivity, and transmission electron microscopy. All researchers involved in this work assist in the development of interactive activities that introduce the wonders of electrochemistry and nanoscience to elementary school students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
