 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award enhances the Nation's competitiveness by investigating improvements to production scheduling in assembly operations that support product customization.  Enhanced customization demands production of a variety of products and in smaller batches. Therefore, it is imperative for manufacturers to respond to such a demand while maintaining or reducing manufacturing costs and remaining competitive in the global market place. This project investigates the use of lot streaming via a two-stage assembly system that captures the essential operational control issues in mass customization, an important production mode that has emerged for industry to achieve lower cost, shorter cycle times, and a greater product variety. Two-stage assembly promotes the idea of postponing final assembly to differentiate between products until the last step. This approach is also directly applicable to two other closely-related manufacturing areas, namely, agile manufacturing and hybrid flow shops. This project will incorporate modeling, solution strategies, and computational approaches to determine optimal lot sizes and schedules in these production scenarios.  The project will educate and train students to be able to tackle complex problems arising in the manufacturing critical to the U.S. economy. The results of the research will be integrated into the courses at the graduate and undergraduate level, thereby benefitting the other students as well. \r\n \r\nThe two-stage assembly lot streaming problem (TSA-LSP) has a unique structure that requires specialized methodology presently lacking in the literature that exploits its special structure and renders effective solution approaches. This project has four main thrusts, namely (1) formulation of a mathematical model incorporating its special features; (2) a comprehensive polyhedral analysis, enhancement of the model, and development of a new decomposition-based methodology to determine optimal/near-optimal number of sublots, sublot sizes and sequencing decisions; (3) a novel approach for the solution of an assembly lot streaming problem (ALSP) with handling and makespan costs that arise as a substructure within the TSA-LSP; (4) advancing the use of lot streaming to a new domain of assembly systems including the Army Sustainable Readiness Model Scheduling Problem (ASR-MSP), and contributing to the knowledge-base of lot streaming by discovering new insights and developing useful algorithms. The ASR-MSP constitutes an important application of the TSA-LSP and will serve as a case study to validate the methods developed.  Insights gained from an investigation of the ALSP are important on their own right as well as serving to enhance the solution methodology for the TSA-LSP for solution of other concrete instances.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
