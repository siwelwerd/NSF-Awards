 "awd_abstract_narration": "Liquid crystals are composed of rod-like or disc-like molecules that enable these materials to behave in some ways like a liquid and in others like a solid. This project is an exploration of the fundamental problem of analyzing the configurations observed in phase transitions in liquid crystals.  Principally, the project will elucidate how the shape of the interface between different phases is determined by a balance of elastic forces and surface tension. The results will be of importance in mathematics, physics, and materials science since development of various morphologies in coexisting phases is a ubiquitous natural phenomenon. The acquired knowledge will bring about new and powerful tools to experimentally control these morphologies, leading to new and exciting applications. This interdisciplinary program further provides opportunities to educate students in the mathematics and physics of liquid crystals. \r\n\r\nThe project will focus on the characterization and description of the overall shape and internal structure of soft condensates representing nuclei of the orientationally ordered phases shaped by bulk elasticity with disparate elastic moduli and anisotropic surface tension. The proposed work will consider a broad spectrum of liquid crystals, embracing nematic and cholesteric liquid crystals that are described by non-orientable director line fields and experience transitions into partially positionally ordered phases, and newly discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals that are described by the director and a vector-valued electric polarization. The mathematical emphasis is on the analysis of stationary variational problems for energies defined over vector- and tensor-valued fields in two and three dimensions and associated gradient flows, so as to describe the equilibrium configurations of liquid crystals and dynamics of interfaces in a plethora of their phase transitions. The principal novelty of the proposed work is that it will consider singular limits of liquid crystal energies that impose severe geometric rigidity on admissible classes of functions. The primary challenges to the analysis arise due to high dimensionality of a target space and the need to consider singular asymptotic limits that result in highly nonlinear constraints. The combined analytical/experimental approach will be essential in that it will provide a clear check of success for the analytical predictions; these predictions, in turn, will guide the experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The focus was on experimental characterization and theoretical description of the structure of soft LC nuclei shaped by bulk elasticity and anisotropic surface tension.</p>\n<p>The intellectual merit of the project is that the elasticity of LCs was treated with different elastic constants describing the splay, twist, and bend of the molecular orientation. The project demonstrated that the widely used one-constant approximation does not adequately describe the complex world of LCs. Explored examples represented (i) droplets of the nematic and columnar LC in an isotropic melt, (ii) isotropic droplets nucleating at the cores of topological defects in a nematic LC, (iii) thin films of ferroelectric nematic LCs. In the columnar phase, the molecules form a two-dimensional periodic lattice; the requirement of a constant period of this lattice prohibits twists and splays but allows bend. As a result, the research established that a columnar droplet is shaped as a doughnut-like torus rather than a sphere. The hole size is controlled by the ratio of the bend elastic constant and the surface tension. In a conventional nematic, all three types of deformations are allowed. The research uncovered that a nematic droplet changes its equilibrium shape from a simply-connected tactoid, which is topologically equivalent to a sphere, to a torus, which is not simply connected. The topological shape transformation is triggered by minute changes in the temperature or concentration and is caused by the interplay of nematic elastic constants, which facilitates splay and bend in tactoids but hinders splay in the toroids. The topological transformation of a droplet from a sphere into a torus is the first example of such a morphogenetic change in an inanimate system. Disparity of the elastic constants also dictates the position of isotropic droplets formed at the cores of topological defects upon heating. These droplets appear at the centers of the defects but as heating progresses, they shift away. The direction of the shift is dictated by the ratio of the splay to bend moduli. Finally, the project demonstrated that the disparity of elastic constants is of prime importance in the equilibrium states of recently discovered ferroelectric nematic LCs, in which the splay is difficult because of the formation of space charge. As a result, their domain structure supports twist and bend but avoids splay. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mathematical analysis of the experimental observations that the balance of strongly anisotropic elastic bulk and interfacial forces yields intricate inner structure and shape of confined LCs represents a major step forward in intellectual insight as compared to the current level of modeling that is hindered by limitations such as the one-constant approximation or a shape fixed by the surface tension insensitive to the bulk elasticity. The disparity of elastic constants represents a significant challenge for analysis in mathematics and materials science; successful modeling of it promises new and interesting applications in materials design. The comprehensive plan of attack included interconnected theoretical and experimental components that validated and informed each other for the duration of the project.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts: The chosen objects of the research represented tractable models of more complex formations, such as condensed strands of DNA, red blood cells, and developing embryos. For example, DNA condensates in viral capsids show toroidal morphology similar to the columnar droplets but these DNA condensates are only 50 nm wide, which makes them very difficult to visualize and explore. In contrast, the columnar droplets are thousands of times larger, which allowed the team to use optical microscopy for the detailed analysis of shapes and inner structure. The elastic anisotropy mechanism might be helpful in understanding topology transformations in morphogenesis and pave the way to control and transform shapes of droplets of liquid crystals and related soft materials. The results will be important in various fields of mathematics, physics, and materials science, since the development of various morphologies in coexisting phases is a ubiquitous natural phenomenon. The acquired knowledge will bring about new and powerful tools to experimentally control the geometry and topology of coexisting phases. The project engaged and educated a new, diverse generation of multi-lingual scientists, including women, with fundamental and technological cross-disciplinary backgrounds in physics, mathematics, engineering, and materials science.
