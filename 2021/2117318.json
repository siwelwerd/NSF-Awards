 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Michigan Technological University is acquiring a 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer to support the research of Marina Tanasova and colleagues Haiying Liu, Shiyue Fang, Evan Kane and Daisuke Minakata. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields including biological chemistry, organic synthesis, nucleotides, polymers, and environmental science. NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool that chemists use for the elucidation of molecular structure. Unknown substances can be identified, specific arrangement of atoms in molecules can be determined, and the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state can be studied. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution as well as regionally.\r\n\r\nThe award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially facilitates the exploration of substrate selection by facilitative sugar transporters gluts with diverse stable sugar mimics, the execution of solid-phase synthesis of monodisperse polyethylene glycol and its derivatives, and the development of technologies for the synthesis of sensitive oligodeoxynucleotides. The instrument is also used to support the design and development of conjugated polymers with xanthene units and three-emission conjugated polymers with xanthene units fused with dyes. In addition, it allows for the investigation of the photochemical fate of dissolved amino acids in natural aquatic environments, the understanding of soil carbon cycling via pore water-dissolved organic matter, and the study of electro-responsive underwater adhesive based on mussel adhesive.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
