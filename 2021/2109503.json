 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow will be studying the impacts of climate change on the cnidarian-algal symbiotic relationship (cnidarians include corals, jellyfish, and sea anemones). This symbiotic relationship is crucial to the stability of marine ecosystems. However, due to increased sea temperatures, many symbiotic cnidarians are dying rapidly. The proposed work will seek to understand how to preserve this relationship under the changing climate by studying the mechanisms behind this relationship at a cellular level. The knowledge gained through this fellowship will provide data that will assist in the conservation efforts of these animals, and help us to better understand this ecosystem. This award will not only allow for the training of a fellow from an underrepresented background, it will also allow the fellow to increase participation of students from underrepresented backgrounds by providing them with mentorship and training in a laboratory setting. \r\n\r\nThe research proposed by the fellow seeks to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying the cnidarian-algal symbiosis. The fellow will use a forward genetic strategy to probe the essential genes for establishing the coral-algal symbiosis. Symbiodiniaceae Breviolum minutum strain SSB01 is known to be able to form symbiosis with many cnidarians including corals, sea anemones and jellyfish. One such cnidarian that is used as a model system for researching questions related to this symbiosis is the jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana. For this research project a library of algal mutants of SSB01 will be generated and then evaluated for their ability to populate Cassiopea xamachana. C. xamachana polyps are easy to rear and grow in large numbers in a laboratory setting which will allow for high throughput analysis of the stability of the symbiosis with the algal mutants. Because working with corals can be problematic, the development of this model system on a cellular level may allow us to develop engineering strategies to counter devastating coral bleaching. Possible strategies might include targeted genetic modification or in-laboratory evolution of algae that are resistant to bleaching.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The cnidarian-algal symbiosis is one of the most recognized marine microbial symbiotic relationships. This relationship occurs between dinoflagellate algae in the family Symbiodiniaceae and many species of cnidarians. It is widely known in relation to coral reef conservation (many reef building corals maintain a relationship with dinoflagellate algae). Though it is known that these dinoflagellate algae play an important role in the overall survival of their host (such as providing nutrients via photosynthesis), almost nothing is known about these algal symbionts at the molecular level. Understanding this relationship at a cellular level can contribute to making cnidarians more resilient to rising sea temperatures, and play a huge role in coral conservation efforts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project outlined to achieve this goal was a forward genetic screening process that was utilized to identify Symbiodiniaceae mutants that cannot establish symbiosis. Forward genetics is an unbiased approach to discover the genes responsible for a particular phenotype. <em>Breviolum minutum</em> (strain SSB01), a Symbiodiniaceae species isolated from the sea anemone <em>Exaiptasia pulchella</em>, was used as the laboratory strain to generate mutant algal cells. Forward genetic screening allowed us in theory to identify mutants that have lost the ability to form a symbiosis with aposymbitotic <em>Cassiopea xamachana</em>&nbsp;(a jellyfish species) and <em>Exaiptaisa pallida </em>(a sea anemone species)&nbsp;polyps (loss of symbiotic ability was the phenotype being screened for). We leveraged the ability of SSB01 algal cells to grow heterotrophically (so cells feed on nutrients rather than carrying out photosynthesis) to create mutant cells, and selected mutants with colors differing from WT plated to determine mutants to pick and grow for infection trials. Mutants were created using UV mutagenesis; WT cells were exposed to a UV light source for either 2 or 4 minutes and then grown up in liquid culture for use in this study (Fig 1).&nbsp; The overall goal was to identify mutants that could no longer establish a symbiosis to help determine genes that are crucial for a stable symbiosis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A first crucial part of this study was to obtain a high number of <em>C. xamachana</em> and <em>Aiptasia </em>polyps so that high throughput analysis could be done (meaning a high number of mutants could be tested at one time). <em>Aiptasia</em> polyps can be produced by cutting a single polyp, which will allow both sides to regenerate leaving 2 separate and intact polyps for use.
