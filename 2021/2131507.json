 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless powered backscatter communication (WPBC) has emerged as a promising technology to support long-term, low-cost, and low-complexity Internet-of-Things (IoT) device communications and networking. Ensuring WPBC security is crucially important to drive its wide applications, e.g., smart cities, smart wearables, smart agriculture, smart skins, mobile payment, and supply chain. However, resource constraints on backscatter devices and the broadcast nature of radio transmissions render the securing of WPBC challenging. Aiming to enhance the resource-constrained WPBC network security, the PIs propose novel techniques that exploit physical layer properties of WPBC and machine learning technologies to achieve efficient key agreement, anti-jamming communication, and robust device authentication with joint consideration of energy efficiency, security, and communication performance. The proposed research is expected to greatly advance the understanding of the design tradeoff between communication and security performance goals in WPBC networks. Under-represented students will be actively involved in the proposed research activities through senior design projects, summer interns, and outreach programs. Research results will be integrated in teaching and disseminated through publications, presentations, and a project website. A significant amount of experimental data will be collected and shared to the wireless communication and networking community.\r\n\r\nThree major research thrusts are proposed in this project. Thrust 1 investigates efficient and scalable key generation schemes between/among wireless powered backscatter devices. Unique challenges in backscatter communication and resource constraints will be efficiently addressed by transceiver designs and optimization. The energy efficiency of the proposed schemes is expected to outperform traditional cryptography-based schemes (e.g., Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange) by one to two orders of magnitude. Thrust 2 studies anti-jamming schemes based on multi-armed bandit (MAB) online learning frameworks to effectively harvest jamming energy to achieve reliable and efficient WPBC in a multi-channel network. The proposed scheme will turn jamming into an energy harvesting opportunity while achieving reliable communication through learning the jammed and jamming-free channels online. The proposed scheme will enjoy low computational and storage overhead. In Thrust 3, the proposed device authentication schemes are expected to achieve high authentication performance by exploiting new factors (i.e., incident signal randomization, angle of arrival estimation) at the physical layer. They can be integrated with higher layer cryptography-based authentication schemes to enable multi-factor authentication with capabilities of detecting and tracing illegal devices. A multi-channel WPBC testbed operating in sub-6GHz bands will be developed based on the wireless identification and sensing platform (WISP) and Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Backscatter communication enables the Internet-of-Things (IoT) backscatter devices (BDs) to transmit data by reflecting and modulating incident RF signals without any costly and power-hungry RF transmitters. Ensuring WPBC security is crucially important to drive its wide applications.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This project investigated four techniques to enhance WPBC security: (1) developed energy-efficient and scalable key agreement scheme for BDs by exploiting unique wireless channel properties; (2) achieved adaptive anti-jamming communication using channel and beam hopping based on reinforcement learning (RL); (3) enhanced device authentication strength with robust and multi-factor authentication schemes using signals controlled and observed at the physical layer; and (4) designed a low-power reconfigurable Rotman lens-based backscatter node in the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band with the capability of reflecting the signal in different angles. These proposed techniques have been evaluated through theoretical analysis, numeric simulation, testbed experiments under different system settings and attacking models.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For energy-efficient and scalable key agreement, the PI proposed a novel PHY key generation scheme based on the extraction of triangle-channel (tri-channel) state information. This novel method multiplies downlink signals and backscatter signals to obtain the information of a triangle channel as a shared random secret source for key generation between BDs. This idea was further extended to group key generation. Theoretical and simulation results showed that the proposed tri-channel based key generation scheme achieves higher secret key generation rate (SKR) than traditional key generation scheme that only uses the bidirectional channel measurements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For anti-jamming communication, the PI developed RL algorithms that enable both frequency and angle/beam domain hopping to significantly mitigate the jamming effect. The learning of jamming channels and patterns not only enables the access point (AP) to communicate with the BD with interference-free but also empowers the BD to harvest energy from the jamming signals. Additionally, we addressed the limitation of BDs, which cannot decode information and harvest energy simultaneously, by incorporating this constraint into our design of a cooperative RL approach. This innovative strategy empowers the BD to make intelligent decisions regarding its operational mode &ndash; whether to prioritize communication or energy harvesting. With the capability of reflecting signals in different directions offered by the Rotman lens-based reconfigurable backscatter node, the RL-based beam hopping scheme can also effectively mitigate the jamming effect. Our bean hopping approach effectively mitigates interference, adapting to structured attacks while maintaining stable performance under unpredictable conditions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For BD authentication, we proposed a multi-stage authentication and attack tracing scheme, BCAuth, based on the physical spatial information of BDs to enhance BD authentication security strength for both static and mobile BDs. By exploiting clustering-based analysis on spatial information, BCAuth is capable of determining the number of attackers and localizing their positions. In addition, we proposed a reciprocal channel-based method for BD re-authentication with better authentication performance than the clustering-based method for mobile BDs when the BDs are able to measure received signal strength (RSS), which also enables mutual authentication. The theoretical analysis and simulation results showed that BatchAuth can obtain desirable performance while concurrently enhancing security and efficiency in BC systems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The PI also collaborated with Georgia Tech on building a reconfigurable mmWave tag prototype that is capable of autonomous mode switching and mid-range communication with low-power consumption. The mmWave tag can reflect signals in selective directions within -45 and +45 degrees with a 270-kHz amplitude shift keying modulation. This prototyped system consumes 65 &micro;W in the detection mode and 143 &micro;W in the communication mode, suggesting the potential to be further developed into a fully passive and energy-autonomous system for long-range applications in complex environments.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding broader impact, with the support of this project, five graduate students (including one female student and one Black African student) and one high school student, were trained on scientific survey, experiment running, data analysis, MATLAB simulation, and scientific writing in the areas of wireless security and machine learning.
