The research topics of MobiSys span multiple disciplines, including wireless networks and communication, mobile sensing and crowdsourcing applications, wearable computing, vehicular and robotic wireless systems, operating systems, distributed algorithms, data management, energy management, sensors, security and privacy. ACM MobiSys brings together academic, industry, and government professionals to a single-track, highly selective forum, and thus provides an ideal venue for ones pursuing technological advances of mobile systems, applications and services. The goal of this student travel support is to promote research engagement of students, especially ones who are not well-funded, under-represented, or otherwise not likely to be able to attend high-profile conferences on mobile systems. The grant will highly encourage such students to become motivated to pursue latest research directions in the related fields.\r\n\r\nThis award is to support approximately 50-100 student participants at recognized US institutions of higher education. They will be selected by the student travel grants committee to maximize their potential benefits from MobiSys, while prioritizing their under-funded or under-represented circumstances. Students\u2019 testimonials will be collect to asses and summarize impact on them from attending this conference. The student participants will have opportunities to exchange innovative ideas in a vibrant field, which will significantly impact their future research directions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
