 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of a hot carrier solar cell has long been considered an exciting prospect for the \r\nrealization of ultra-high efficiency solar cells with the ability to convert more of the sun\u2019s energy \r\nto useful power. Hot carriers are photogenerated when photons with energy well above the \r\nthreshold (or band gap) for absorption in the semiconductor used to produce the solar cell are \r\nabsorbed. For most materials, the hot carriers then rapidly interact with the material to generate \r\nheat. This parasitic thermal energy cannot be converted to useful power and is therefore a major \r\nloss process in commercial solar cells. To date, the solar cells used terrestrially are limited to power \r\nconversion efficiencies of ~ 30%. If \u201chot\u201d photogenerated charge carriers were harnessed prior to \r\ngenerating heat, the conversation efficiency of a solar cell has been predicted to exceed 60%. This \r\nwould significantly reduce system costs and increase the global impact of photovoltaic technology,\r\ntherefore contributing significantly to sustainable and clean energy sources. This research also \r\ncreates the potential for a new generation of solar cell technologies, generating new devices and \r\nconsumer products, as well as having significant implications for future sources of energy. \r\n Extracting hot carriers is, however, extremely challenging, and requires significant innovation \r\nand the development of novel systems and architectures that effectively decouple heat generation \r\nprocesses. One possible avenue to achieve this goal is via valley photovoltaics, a protocol recently \r\ndeveloped by the PI to store the high energy hot carriers through a natural process observed in high \r\nmobility transistors in which hot carriers transfer to so-called satellite valleys in the structure of \r\nthe solar cell absorber. This process slows heat generation and provides the opportunity to remove \r\nthese carriers before they lose energy and create heat. \r\n\r\nDespite this success, there are several important fundamental processes to understand before a \r\npractical valley photovoltaic solar cell can be realized. In particular although the transfer and \r\nstorage of hot carriers to the satellite valleys and therefore reduced heat loss has been demonstrated\r\n\u2013 the ability to remove the carriers and provide useful voltage and current remains problematic due \r\nto parasitic barriers to carrier extraction in the proof-of-principle devices developed to date. In this\r\nprogram a comprehensive investigation of III-V heterostructures is proposed encompassing \r\nmaterial growth, optical spectroscopy, and device physics such as to deliver a practical hot carrier \r\nsolar cell. The proposed research will take the important new results demonstrated by the PI to\r\nsystematically optimize the device design and operation of a hot carrier solar cell based on, or \r\nenhanced by, intervalley scattering. Specifically, material systems and solar cell structures that \r\nenhance hot carrier extraction will require novel barrier/selective-contact layers with specific \r\nproperties. Furthermore, novel architectures will be necessary that not only scatter high energy \r\nphotocarriers but also sustain large internal electric fields at the operating point of the solar cell,\r\nso photogenerated carriers at lower energies can also be harnessed further improving the efficiency \r\nof the device.\r\n\r\nThe applied and fundamental nature of this work exposes the graduate and undergraduate \r\nstudents involved in this program to a diverse research activity. This will enable them to develop \r\nconsiderable practical skills while exposing them to the process of materials development and\r\ntechnology transfer, an experience unique in graduate research and of significant value to their \r\nfuture careers. The program also provides research opportunities for minority students, including \r\nsummer research in the group of the PI.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
