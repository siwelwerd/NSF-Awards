 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. An accurate assessment of nutritional status is essential for survival. Fat cells signal a nutrient surplus state by secreting hormones called adipokines. Adipokines regulate decisions on several physiological processes including hunger, immunity, and reproduction. In surplus states, adipokines release a signal indicating energy resources can be devoted to costly activities like immunity and reproduction. During starvation, their secretion is reduced, signaling an energy deficit driving energy conservation. Recent evidence suggests that nuclear sequestration of the fly adipokine Upd2 is controlled by Atg8, a protein known for its role in autophagy.  Furthermore, Upd2 can be forced to remain nuclear by disrupting the protein-protein interactions of Upd2 and Atg8, resulting in increased starvation resistance and promoting post-starvation hunger responses in flies. These data suggest that Upd2 and Atg8 may affect gene expression. This study seeks to determine the role of this unstudied form of adipokine-driven gene expression. The project will devote this research to teaching and mentoring high school students of underrepresented minorities through an established summer internship program to teach students basic fly research concepts and cultivate scientific interest.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to delineate how Upd2 and Atg8 modify the nuclear landscape to regulate organismal fitness during and after nutrient stress. Neither protein can bind DNA, so DNA/Chromatin binding proteins associated with Upd2 and Atg8 will be determined via immunoprecipitation. The project will determine where Upd2 binds to the genome using the CUT&Tag method of epigenomic profiling.  In conjuction, a differential expression profile of genes associated with changes in nutrient state will be generated using RNAseq. Data from both analyses will be combined using current computational approaches to identify candidate genes regulated by Upd2 in a nutrient-dependent manner. Candidate genes will be mutated in the fly model for feeding behavior analysis during fed and starvation conditions to prove their involvement in the nutrient sensing response. This behavioral screening will provide a fun and simple way to introduce undergraduates to basic concepts of fly research and the Fellow will receive new experience and training in this study system as well.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nLeptin is well known for its role as a satiety signal, being released from the fat to the brain to give a feeling of fullness as a cue to end feeding. Having a satiety signal is critical to many organisms, as unhindered food consumption leads to obesity and associated diseases, whereas having no hunger response can lead to nutrient deprivation and low survival. As such, Leptin is conserved across species with similar a protein called Upd2 found in fruit flies. Previous work in my lab identified a mutation in the Upd2 protein that prevented its release from the fat tissue, specifically keeping Upd2 in the nucleus. This mutation was associated with another protein, Atg8 or LC3 in humans, which is known for its key role in targeting and recycling unused or dysfunctional cellular components. We were intrigued by this finding, as Leptin/Upd2 is well known for its role in signaling in the brain but little is known if it has a function in the nucleus. Even more surprising was that flies with this mutation displayed an improved response to feeding cues such as starvation, displaying higher feeding behavior and improved survival to diet challenges without Upd2 reaching the brain. As such, the ultimate goal of the project was to ascertain the function of Leptin/Upd2 in the nucleus and its connection with Atg8.\n\n\nDuring this project, we performed a genetic screen to identify all genes impacted by our Upd2 mutation that prevented interaction with Atg8. From this screen, we surprisingly identified several genes associated with the immune response to infection. This was exciting, as both Upd2/Leptin and Atg8 are not known to directly control immune response. To test the importance of Upd2s role in immune response, we infected flies with and without the mutation to compare their ability to survive an infection. Our research found that flies with the mutated Upd2 were more susceptible to infection and immune challenge, suggesting that Upd2 and Atg8 interaction is important to combat infection. However, when we tested the flys ability to survive on a standard diet or a high-sugar diet, we found that the mutated flies survived much longer in both circumstances. This seems to suggest that when Upd2 does not interact with Atg8 it improves feeding response and survival at the cost of a weaker immune response.\n\n\nNext using human fat tissue, we performed experiments on human Leptin to see if what we found in the fly was relevant to humans. First, we created a similar Leptin mutant that could not interact with Atg8 (called LC3 in humans). Then, we identified all proteins that could bind to Leptin and compared this to the proteins that bound to our Leptin mutant. We first learned that Leptin can bind to proteins known to interact and manipulate DNA and gene expression, consistent with our findings on the fly. Additionally, we identified a distinct group of proteins involved in protein transport out of the cell that were unable to bind to our mutant Leptin. This indicates that LC3s key role with Leptin could be the transport of Leptin out of the cell and without it, Leptin remains in the nucleus. Finally, we were able to show in human fat tissue that when you inhibit autophagy proteins, including LC3, we were able to stop the release of Leptin out of the fat. This proved that Upd2 and Atg8 in the fly behave in the same way as human Leptin and autophagy proteins. This is critical, as it shows that future fly work on Upd2 and Atg8 can give us deep and relevant insight into human Leptin and LC3. \n\n\n In conclusion, the work from this project has identified a previously unknown gene regulatory role of Upd2. Our work has shown that in conjunction with Atg8, Upd2 can modulate gene expression in the fat tissue nucleus, primarily impacting immune genes, which is important for the fly to modulate its feeding behavior under different diet conditions or in the face of an immune challenge. Our work has shown that Atg8 additionally plays a key role in the transport of Upd2 out of the cell through an autophagy-mediated transport system. Finally, our work has demonstrated that in human fat tissue, the Atg8 equivalent protein LC3 also controls Leptin (Upd2 equivalent in humans) transport and release from the cell. In summary, this research has revealed a new role of Upd2/Leptin and Atg8/LC3 in both metabolism and immunity which could have a major impact on our understanding of hunger response and how nutrient status is connected to our immune response.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/22/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: KevinPKelly\n"
