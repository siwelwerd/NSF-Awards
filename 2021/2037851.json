 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Training Group project brings new students and postdoctoral researchers into research groups in analysis and partial differential equations. The twelve senior personnel will recruit junior mathematicians to join the group as students and postdocs and closely mentor them throughout their training. The project places particular emphasis on diversifying the group\u2019s undergraduate and graduate programs through expanded, targeted recruitment efforts and structured mentoring. Seminar exchanges and international collaborations will develop a mentor coalition among research groups, while also providing advanced graduate students and postdoctoral researchers at other institutions opportunities to come to the University of Wisconsin-Madison to interact with the group\u2019s senior personnel. Annual RTG workshops will provide a more intensive venue for the sharing of research results and development of collaborative relationships among researchers from all seniority levels. Weekly graduate writing groups during the academic year will be complemented by annual writing camps involving early-career researchers from other universities.\r\n\r\nThe project capitalizes on the experience of the University of Wisconsin-Madison faculty in analysis and partial differential equations to connect mathematicians at all levels of experience with cutting edge research. The project gives trainees the opportunities and mentoring needed to become leaders in the rapidly growing fields of harmonic analysis, spectral theory, analytic number theory, dispersive equations, fluid dynamics, and nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations. Traditional graduate and postdoctoral research opportunities will be augmented by community-oriented mentoring structures, while new undergraduate research programs and courses will provide the most junior trainees a foothold in high-demand research areas. Vertical integration, in which senior personnel, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate and undergraduate students collaborate on projects, will increase research productivity while also providing opportunities for trainees to develop their skills as the next generation of educators and mentors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
