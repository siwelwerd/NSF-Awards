 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the organization of the annual Principal Investigators (PI) meeting for the National Robotics Initiative (NRI) and Foundational Research in Robotics (FRR), which were launched in 2011 and 2020 respectively. The PI meeting will bring together the community of active robotics researchers to provide cross-project coordination of intellectual challenges and best practices in education, technology transfer and general outreach. This activity will also establish a repository illustrating the research ideas explored and milestones achieved by the various robotics projects. The meeting is planned for three days in March of 2021, to be held virtually. The format will include presentations by the attending PIs of projects in their final year, a poster session with all other projects, keynote speeches, and panel discussions. \r\n\r\nThis award is to organize the spring 2021 NRI and FRR PI meeting. The meeting promotes dissemination and serendipitous collaboration amongst robotics researchers. The organization includes participation  for graduate students as well as PIs. This award is for the meeting organization only.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The PI meeting is an annual event that brings together all of the scientists and engineers funded by the NRI and FRR to report on their progress, share new results, and to get a broad overview of NSF's research portfolio.\n\nDue to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 PI meeting was held online, rather than in person.  It consisted of both long (20 minutes) and short (3 minutes) talks, poster sessions, plenary talks from invited speakers, and panels exploring the interaction between NSF-funded researchers and industry.  Because of the online nature of the meeting, we were able to open it up to graduate students working on the projects, to give them some exposure to NSF's funding models and expectations.\n\nThe meeting was successfully held over a three-day period from March 10th to 12th, 2021.  413 participants registered for the event, of which 249 were PIs or co-PIs on an NSF-funded project, 42 were government representatives, 31 were non-PI academics, and 79 were students.  This is the largest number of students to have attended a PI meeting to date, and was enabled by the online nature of the event.  We also had two representatives of the press registered, to facilitate a wider dissemination of the results to the general public.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William D Smart"
