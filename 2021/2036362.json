 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the deployment of solar power in the United States. The technology can potentially make solar panels up to 16% more efficient and result in up to 10% lower costs. This enables solar power to potentially become more economically viable across larger parts of the United States. This technology can serve the existing 110 GW solar panel market. Global commercialization of the technology can increase solar energy production by 14,000 TWh and reduce carbon emissions from the power sector by 6 billion tonnes.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a light conversion material that combines a light absorber material, a wide bandgap inorganic perovskite, with a highly efficient, quantum cutting near-IR emitter, a ytterbium dopant. The material is applied to existing solar panel components using a rapid vapor deposition process to create drop-in replacements, avoiding changes to the panel production process.  Traditional silicon solar panels poorly convert ultraviolet light into electricity, generating substantial waste heat and degrading panels.  The light conversion materials developed here utilizes that traditionally wasted light, thereby boosting overall panel efficiencies.  This project will confirm the feasibility of the technology for solar applications by building coupon solar modules, measuring power performance improvements, and confirming intrinsic device stability through environmental stress tests.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
