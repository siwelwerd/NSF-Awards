 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nUW Bothell has no general access to research computing resources - this project transforms the capacity for computational science research and education on campus. The University of Washington maintains an integrated, scalable, super-computing infrastructure called Hyak to support research computing across all units and campuses. Academic and research units at the university purchase nodes on Hyak as an alternative to deploying and operating their own high-performance systems. This award allows the small University of Washington Bothell campus to become a participant in the Hyak system creating a dedicated research computing capacity for our faculty and students. The team of researchers participating in this project form the core users of the new system and span a wide range of computational research fields including astrophysics, climate modeling, biochemistry, genomics, machine learning, operations research, and mathematics. The new capacity allows the development of a larger cross-campus initiative for computational science education supporting our undergraduate teaching mission.\r\n\r\nThis project supports the acquisition and operation of compute nodes and associated hardware in the Hyak system. UW Bothell is a sponsor of the Hyak facility and participates in its governance and decision-making processes. HPC nodes procured include 60 Intel Xeon Scalable Gold 6230 20-core 2.1GHz CPUs for 1,200 total cores and 8 NVIDIA Quadro RTX6000 24GB GPUs. Each node includes 192 GB RAM and a 100 Gbps cluster interface. Data storage is provided by 33 TB high-speed scratch storage and 33 TB of archival tape storage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
