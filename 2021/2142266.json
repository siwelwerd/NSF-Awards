 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of Cognitive Neuroscience has expanded by leaps and bounds over the past 20 years - the number of yearly publications has increased 20-fold over these two decades. Bringing the Cognitive Neuroscience community together for focused and in-depth discussion of cutting edge research every two years is incredibly valuable (the 2020 Gordon Conference was not held because of the pandemic). Meanwhile there has also been an explosion of information in molecular, cellular, circuit and systems neuroscience but little of that information has made significant inroads into our understanding of cognitive function. This Gordon Research Conference on the Neurobiology of Cognition should help bridge the gap, at the very least by identifying the avenues for connection that have the most potential for near-term traction and by linking scientist from disparate fields. \r\n\r\nThe Gordon conference (GRS and GRC) will take place in July, 2022. The emphasis of the workshop is to facilitate in-depth discussion between scientists working in divergent fields whose integration is essential to understanding the neurobiology of cognition. NSF support will enable graduate students and postdoctoral trainees and early investigators to participate in this high-profile workshop and will allow early stage investigators (non-tenured) to attend as speakers and full participants. Trainee fellowships to cover travel and registration expenses will be preferentially given to women and under-represented minorities in order to enhance diversity in the field of cognitive neuroscience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
