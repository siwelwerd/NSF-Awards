 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coral reefs are large underwater structures composed of the skeletons of corals that support entire ecosystems. They also provide substantial benefits to society that are estimated to total $1 trillion annually. These benefits include providing  storm protection to shorelines, as well as supporting sport and commercial fisheries and tourism. Unfortunately, the global loss of living coral from coral reefs has resulted in greatly reduced benefits to ecosystem health and society. Coral reproduces by generating swimming larvae that must find a safe surface on the reef to attach and grow. This process has a low success rate because the underwater surfaces of reefs no longer support juvenile coral survival. Relatively little is known about the how coral reef surfaces influence coral attachment and growth. The goal of this research is to address this knowledge gap and develop engineered surfaces to promote coral larvae settlement through a collaboration of materials engineering, fluid physics, microbiology, and conservation biology. Engineered surfaces will be deployed and tested on floating underwater platforms that are designed to support growing coral attachment and increase survival of coral by increasing water flow and oxygen availability. Successful completion of this research will transform the field of coral reef restoration, resulting in improved nearshore water quality and increased reef resilience to climate change and ocean acidification. Benefits to society result from improved recreational and commercial fisheries, as well as tourism. Further benefits result from interdisciplinary environmental research training for college students and early-career scientists to improve the Nation\u2019s STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nDuring sexual reproduction, swimming coral larvae must locate an appropriate substrate on which to settle and grow. Unfortunately, fundamental knowledge about the role of substrate properties that control successful coral larval settlement is lacking. This knowledge gap is particularly critical as coral reefs are in decline on a global basis due to climate change, ocean acidification, and other environmental disturbances. The goal of the project is to address these knowledge gaps and increase understanding of the physical and biochemical cues that enhance larval settlement and growth. This will be achieved by a convergent research approach that includes materials science and engineering, fluid mechanics, coral reproduction, marine microbiology, and reef ecology. The specific research objectives designed to achieve the overall goal are to: i) tailor material properties to release organic and ionic additives from natural hydraulic lime substrates that enhance the attraction, attachment, and settlement responses of coral larvae; ii) quantify fluid-substrate interactions, attachment, and microscale coral larvae transport near diverse substrate topographies using computational simulations and particle tracking experiments in custom-built oscillating flume chambers; iii) combine state-of-art materials characterization techniques and metagenomics methods to determine how substrate properties alter the microbiomes and skeletal growth of juvenile corals during and after successful settlement; and iv) deploy and test engineered substrates on floating restoration platforms designed to keep coral away from low flow, hypoxic, and algae-dominated benthic environments. Successful completion of this research has the potential to transform the field of coral restoration science and facilitate the restoration of coral reef ecological function. Restoration of critical coral reef resources will have numerous ecological and societal benefits, including supporting fisheries and tourism economies, as well as providing shoreline protection. The project will provide convergent, multidisciplinary training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and underrepresented students in the Mathematics, Engineering, Science, Achievement (MESA) program. Additional benefits result from the training of a new generation of scientists in crossing disciplinary boundaries to solve societal grand challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
