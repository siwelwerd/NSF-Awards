 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impacts/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will provide scientifically-founded insights to empower consumers and professionals to make informed decisions regarding the skincare products they use and guide clients on proper use. Consumers lack an understanding of their skin properties and needs, as well as knowledge around the biochemical basis for the use of a particular product or ingredient. As a result, they spend money and time trying new products and seek professional assistance in managing their skin. This project has the potential to bring robust scientific information to the skincare industry, a sector that is largely unregulated, which may result in an increase of consumer confidence in the beneficial use of their skincare products. Both direct-to-consumer and professional markets can be transformed by this technology, owing to its ability to enable commercial opportunities that will increase the overall health and wellness of individuals through self-testing. This self-testing will drive skincare product manufacturers to formulate high-quality products with ingredient transparency (including product analysis and ingredient quality control) and will create competition in the home testing market. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project focuses on a skin phenotype assessment technology to empower consumers to make informed choices about skincare products. Specifically, mass spectrometry (MS)-based molecular omics analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) are used to determine ideal facial skincare products and/or ingredients for an individual's unique skin. The state-of-the-art MS analysis illuminates the composition of skin cells at the molecular level (e.g., amino acids, ceramides). The molecular composition can be used to characterize skin health (e.g., structure, function, environmental exposures, and hydration). The product-skin fit AI matches the needs of the individual's skin to existing products based on the biological functions of active and common ingredients in skincare products. Through prior work in animal models, 5,240 skin analytes were detected and > 50 different lipid and metabolite classes identified. These molecularly-diverse metabolites and lipids highlight the depth of biological information contained in skin cells. Taken together, the skin phenotype technology will allow for the use of scientifically proven data to address the challenges in the skincare industry (i.e. subpar skin results, discarded products, loss of valuable time, and wasted money for consumers) and allow individuals to achieve their skincare needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe skincare industry, with a global market of US$136B in 2020 and CAGR of 2.9% between 2020-2027, is saturated with a burdensome load of products. This creates a complex navigation, identification, and decision-making scenario for consumers who must traverse this vast, dynamic labyrinth without the aid of an objective scientific guide. US consumers purchase $4.1B of skincare products per year based on perceived quality, price, scent, recommendations from friends and family members, professional advice, reviews, and claims in product marketing materials (Statistica, May 2020). All of these information sources, however, are devoid of a solid scientific basis for the use of a specific product and/or ingredient by an individual. This results in subpar skin results, discarded products, loss of valuable time, and wasted money for individual consumers. \n\n\nFinally Skincare began the National Science Foundation\u2019s I-Corps program to evaluate the commercial opportunity for developing a science-based skincare platform that would analyze the molecular makeup of an individual\u2019s skin and direct individuals to ideal products and/or ingredients for their unique skin in an effort to 1. increase self-confidence, 2. understand one's own skin, 3. alleviate pains of trial and error and 4. increase confidence in one\u2019s skincare routine efficacy. The team conducted &gt; 120 interviews during the 7-week I-Corps program and a total &gt; 180 interviews during the entire award period. These customer discovery interviews led the team to identify an early adopter customer segment (i.e., mid-tier skincare brands) and to validate that increasing self-confidence was a powerful value proposition. During the I-Corps program, the team developed a Business Model Canvas and made strong connections with potential early adopters of our technology.  \n\n\nOver the course of the award period, the team launched its first skin assessment study (IRB approval #21074) and were able to analyze skin samples from individuals in which we made connections with during customer discovery. They were accepted into Vanderbilt University\u2019s inaugural Founders program, received $10k grand funding from LaunchTN, received an NIH STTR award (R41AR082172, PI: Entrepreneurial lead) and attended numerous health and beauty tradeshows in the skincare industry.    \n\n\nLastly, the I-Corps program provided an invaluable opportunity for the team (technical and entrepreneurial leads) to assess the value and sustainability of our solution within the skincare industry. We were able to gain skincare industry knowledge, learn commercialization skills, and make numerous connections in the skincare space through the customer discovery process. Taken together, these opportunities have propelled our company forward at an accelerated rate.  \n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/26/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stacy D Sherrod"
