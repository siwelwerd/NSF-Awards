 "awd_abstract_narration": "American Samoa, located 10,000 miles from the United States mainland, is the only US Territory in the South Pacific Ocean.  American Samoa Community College is the only college on the island.  With this award, the College will establish the Technician Education Readiness Pathway to meet the critical need for a skilled technical workforce.  Nearly all students entering American Samoa Community College require remediation in mathematics and reading, which bars them from enrolling in the existing Technician Education programs.  Currently, less than 5% of high school teachers are rated as \u2018highly qualified\u2019 in these subject areas.  The Technician Education Readiness Pathway will adopt the STEM Guitar Building curriculum to enhance education in applied math, as well as technical reading and writing.  This curriculum builds on the strong cultural connection that music plays in everyday life in American Samoa, thus providing additional motivation for students and teachers in the technician education pathway.  \r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to (1) improve student knowledge in STEM concepts, (2) increase the number of students eligible to enroll in Technician Education programs, and (3) prepare students for industry recognized certification exams.  The Technician Education Readiness Pathway will establish a partnership between the STEM faculty of American Samoa Community College and teachers from Nu\u2019uli Vocational Technical High School.  The partnership will provide professional development for 20 educators on the Guitar Building curriculum, which will include training in AutoCAD and a laser cutting system.  The trained faculty and teachers will then work with at least 100 students over three years to integrate STEM learning with guitar building as they prepare to enroll in the Technician Education programs.  Students that enter without the need for remedial coursework will be able to quickly earn a STEM certificate or degree, making them eligible for employment in the STEM workforce.  American Samoa Community College will establish an advisory board that includes the American Samoa Power authority to gain industry feedback, and the Oceania Community Development Network to broadly disseminate the program\u2019s successes.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
