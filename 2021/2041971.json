 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid variations in radiation belt electron fluxes during geomagnetic storms continue to challenge our understanding of space weather. To better understand these variations, this project investigates how kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves (KAWs) affect energetic electron transport in the inner magnetosphere. A novel approach will be taken which utilizes NASA Van Allen Probes data (with select conjunction intervals from the NASA BARREL balloon mission) and 3-D fluid-kinetic simulations. A graduate student and post-doctoral researcher will be supported by the work.\r\n\r\nThis research will explore the turbulent wavefields and the mechanisms through which scattering in these field topologies may occur. This will be achieved through the analysis of fields and particle measurements from the Van Allen Probes spacecraft and particle simulations for distributions of electrons in turbulent wavefields generated from a hybrid data-theory formalism. These analyses will (1) determine how turbulent KAW wavefield topologies drive rapid scattering of outer radiation belt electrons and (2) quantify from statistical wave field measurements and transport rates derived via simulations, the contribution of this scattering process to outer radiation belt transport. This research will also be supported by analyses of a number of conjugate Van Allen Probes-high altitude balloon events of energetic precipitation in these wavefields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
