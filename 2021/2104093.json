 "awd_abstract_narration": "Platelets are blood cells that help to stop bleeding after injury by forming adhesive bonds to other parts of the blood and body.  They must be able to tell the difference between bleeding and the ordinary forces encountered as they tumble and bump along a healthy blood vessel.  This is important so that platelets don't cause a stroke by spontaneously forming blood clots in healthy vessels.  The biochemical signals governing clotting have been intensely studied, but the response of platelets to mechanical loading is largely unknown. This research will test whether force sensing is important in the 'decision' of a platelet to participate in clotting. The project will identify mechanical cues that trigger platelet responses and the internal signals that communicate the responses inside the cell.  Undergraduate and graduate biomedical engineers will perform the research.  Interactive demonstrations to K-12 students will improve the environment for younger students to participate in science education. This research will benefit society by discovering fundamental knowledge needed to develop new therapies for occlusive thrombosis (stroke) and for some bleeding disorders.\r\n\r\nWhile mechanical sensing and mechanotransduction (conversion of mechanical to biochemical signals) processes in nucleated cells are beginning to be understood, little is known about the role and existence of mechanotransduction in regulating anucleate platelet adhesive functions in response to their hemodynamic environment. By investigating the platelet actomyosin cytoskeleton, efforts of this work will aim to examine the mechanochemical steps that support firm integrin-dependent platelet adhesion and shape change under varied hemodynamic environments using specialized microfluidic devices, high speed microscopy, single cell force measurements, and nanoscale flow quantification.  We aim to define the platelet hemodynamic forces relative to outside-in-signaling processes that trigger ligand-dependent integrin clustering, assembly of actin-based cytoskeletal complexes, and cytoskeletal reorganization. Dynamic contractile patterns associated with myosin II will be assessed to identify hemodynamic signals that lead to firm adhesion and cell detachment. Lastly, biochemical and biomechanical signals involved in these processed will be defined. This work will improve our understanding of how platelets respond to changes in flow after their initial tethering/adhesion, which is fundamental to processes that lead to normal hemostasis, relative to bleeding or thrombosis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Although much has been learned about the role of platelets in this process, there has been limited understanding of mechanical force responses. In this work, we investigated the formation of a tether that helps to slow platelets that attach to the surface, similar to an anchor being thrown into the water in order to slow down a boat (see Tether figure). If the anchor&rsquo;s rope lacked elasticity, the impact of it latching to a surface would cause a large jerk and could create damage to the boat in order to instantaneously stop the boat&rsquo;s momentum. However, if the rope were elastic and slowed down the boat in time, less damage would be expected. Similarly, as platelets rapidly transport through our vessels, they must come to a stop at the wound site, while their tethers given them an ability to slow them down in a &lsquo;gentle&rsquo; way where contractile components in the platelet pulls back toward the initial anchor site. We investigated how this process works and have characterized these tethers, with outcomes that can give us insight into mechanisms that help in wound healing and mechanisms that could lead to negative outcomes like heart attacks and strokes. This was done by flowing blood through very small channels over protein strips (see Experimental setup figure). We have also created a model of tether extension with an active component that creates contraction (see Tether extension <span>quantification&nbsp;</span>figure). This model has helped us to understand the mechanisms contributing to tether behavior. We have also incorporated discoveries from this work into coursework and have developed interactive demonstrations of this process to teach a broader population how platelets behave in wound healing.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/13/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;L&nbsp;Bark</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2104093/2104093_10542208_1665673144758_tether--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2104093/2104093_10542208_1665673144758_tether--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tether\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2104093/2104093_10542208_1665673144758_tether--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tether\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The formation of a tether of a normal platelet and one where polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton is inhibited.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jacob Null</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;L&nbsp;Bark</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tether</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2104093/2104093_10542208_1665672736054_tether_extension--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2104093/2104093_10542208_1665672736054_tether_extension--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tether extension quantification\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2104093/2104093_10542208_1665672736054_tether_extension--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tether extension quantification\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Comparison of experimental results with a model of tether extension.
