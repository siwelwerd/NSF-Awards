 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has. One of the goals of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, which remains the premier Energy Frontier particle accelerator, operating at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland, is to discover new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This award will contribute to the potential discoveries of BSM in three main categories: 1) maintain the on-going operations of the ATLAS detector, including the trigger system, as well as work on the proposed upgrade to the detector over the next three years, 2) contribute physics analysis to both Standard Model physics (in order to be able to recognize BSM physics) and searches for new particles which directly reveal BSM physics, and 3) contribute to education and outreach efforts to explain BSM physics to non-scientists including elementary students. \r\n\r\nThis award to the Michigan State University targets physics studies under the general category of searches for new vector bosons. The study will search for new heavy bosons predicted in many BSM physics models.  A discovery of any of these bosons would be truly transformative. In addition, work will include improved studies on the Standard Model, reducing theoretical uncertainties by making precision measurements of cross sections in lepton decay channels at the LHC energies.  Members of the MSU high energy physics group have traditionally had a strong involvement in education and outreach, and the group has been especially innovative in informal education. This award will contribute to the creation of a \u201cvirtual reality\u201d experience that will allow the general public to visualize LHC physics events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In their own right each of these searches were powerful probes into the unknown, but the NSF's support further allowed these searches to be statistically combined together with many other ATLAS searches (23 in total) for the first time to provide the most comprehensive and sensitive coherent search for heavy resonances to date (see <span>gHgF_5000_Comp</span>). This result observed a tantalising hint of something to watch in the future, in the mode where this new heavy resonance could be created by the fusion of two vector bosons (see <span>pValue_VBF</span>). In a separate physics publication outside of the ATLAS collaboration, the NSF's support also enabled Dan Hayden to lead work with experimentalists and theorists at MSU to understand how to reduce some of the largest theory uncertainties (involving parton distribution functions) that are beginning to limit the sensitivity of some searches for new physics at the LHC, which is critical to solve as we move into the high luminosity era of measurements and searches in the field.</p>\n<p>Beyond the searches for new physics the NSF's generous support enabled members of Hayden's group to take on multiple leadership positions within the collaboration, with Dan Hayden becoming the ATLAS Exotics group convener, Robert Les being appointed the Jet Tagging Subgroup Convener, and Stergios Kazakos being appointed as the Tile Run Coordinator. The graduate students in Hayden's group not only played key roles in their respective analyses but also contributed to the wider ATLAS collaboration by performing important physics performance work, and shifts ensuring the continued operation of the detector from the ATLAS control room.</p>\n<p>In terms of hardware this award supported invaluable work on the Phase-I and Phase-II ATLAS upgrades, specifically the Fiber Optic Exchange (known as \"FOX\") which connects the masses of information streaming from the detector through over 10,000 fiber optic wires, to the relevant processors that extract features from this information to form the physics objects that analysers use to perform measurements and searches with the ATLAS data. One of six current FOX boxes is shown in the \"FOX Construction\" image.</p>\n<p>There was a strong push on outreach and educational outcomes for this project, which can best be summarised in two areas. Firstly, and key to this is that it was during the COVID pandemic, a series of lectures broadcast live over youtube and facebook were arranged under the banner \"The Great Lakes Lectures\". This project, created and led by Dan Hayden with the NSF's support, covered a wide range of topics from faculty and postdoctoral researchers based at MSU. This effort took advantage of the MSU Library's 360 degree projector room with 4k visual and audio equipment, and held live Q&amp;A sessions with the public, teachers, and students following the lectures. The image \"GLL\" shows a snapshot of the inaugural lecture given by Daniel Hayden, and this lecture series led to a number of local TV news network interviews, and further follow ups with local schools. The second particularly noteworthy avenue of work was the effort to build a virtual reality experience for the public, to be able to not only experience the ATLAS detector as if you were standing in the cavern underground in Switzerland, but also if you could see the proton-proton collisions and their remnants with your own eyes. A particularly productive part of this project was working with a gifted young REU student over one summer, who learned how to code in Unreal Engine, and made meaingful contributions to the project. In the image \"REU People\" you can see the student presenting their poster on the project at the end of their summer, noting that they were the only person to have a hands-on component to their project, where viewers could try out the virtual reality experience for themselves! Shown in the image \"REU Poster\" you can see their poster in more detail, proudly displayed outside of Dan Hayden's office.</p>\n<p>In summary, the NSF's generous support for this project has helped move the needle on a number of important topics in the field, raised the awareness of our work with the public, and provided valuable training to postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 09/06/2024<br>\nModified by: Daniel&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hayden</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2111226/2111226_10768034_1725656853035_GLL--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2111226/2111226_10768034_1725656853035_GLL--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"GLL\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2111226/2111226_10768034_1725656853035_GLL--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"GLL\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photo of Daniel Hayden giving the inaugural lecture on searching for new physics with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, as part of the Great Lakes Lectures series.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel Hayden</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hayden\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">GLL</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2111226/2111226_10768034_1725657972427_REU_People--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2111226/2111226_10768034_1725657972427_REU_People--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REU People\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2111226/2111226_10768034_1725657972427_REU_People--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REU People\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This photo shows the REU Poster session at MSU.
