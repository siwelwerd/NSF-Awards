 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to support a testing device for collection, transportation and diagnosis of certain viral infections, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and measles. Recent viral outbreaks of measles, Ebola, Zika, SARS-CoV, and the COVID-19 pandemic have illustrated the need for fast and accurate diagnosis to contain the outbreak, as well as for decentralized testing during periods of quarantine or general global epidemiological surveillance. The technology will enable at-home or remote location specimen collection without the need for traditional, costly, draw stations and overnight cold-pack shipments.  The initial target is hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections.  The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that adults should be screened for HCV infection at least once in their lifetimes, and women should be screened during each pregnancy. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will focus on solving the inherent instability of RNA viruses.  RNA viruses, in liquid blood and especially dry, degrade rapidly.  It is why SARS-COV-2 is primarily a contact/aerosol transmission and not a problem with packages.  RNA samples have a high sensitivity to ribonucleases (enzymes that catalyze the degradation of RNA) and degrade in a short period of time when dried.  Thiis project will create a special protective environment so that when the specimen dries it does not degrade; it will consist of a device that retains a fixed and known amount of specimen, desiccant for drying, and modified atmospheric packaging (MAP) preventing specimen degradation at ambient temperature for up to 14 days.  The MAP prevents gas exchange during transit, enabling collection and transport in any weather conditions including cold, heat, and high humidity.  Upon arrival at the laboratory, an extraction process will recover the RNA virus for testing via RT-qPCR.  This project will evaluate the impact of drying time, inhibition of ribonucleases, gas content within the MAP, transport media, extraction buffer, and RT-qPCR techniques to stabilize and quantify HCV.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Viral load testing or viral particle quantitation in the blood is used to diagnose and predict treatment response and monitor antiviral therapy in Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. Recent viral outbreaks of Measles, Ebola, Zika, have brought the attention of health organizations worldwide to the need not only for a fast and accurate on-site diagnosis to contain the outbreak but also for decentralized testing for global remote epidemiological analysis. Unlike the current SARS CoV2 (Covid) pandemic which can be detected by using non-invasive nasal swabs or saliva, HCV, HIV, Measles, Ebola, Zika all require blood samples for analysis. In addition, these viruses carry their genes as single-stranded RNA which is sensitive to fast degradation in blood samples due to the presence of Ribonucleases (RNases) ? a type of hydrolytic enzyme that degrades ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this project was to develop a remote testing prototype device for collection, transportation, storage, and then lab extraction of RNA virus samples. As the initial model, we selected HCV which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends screening at least once in a lifetime for&nbsp;<strong>all adults</strong>&nbsp;aged 18 years and older, and for every woman during her pregnancy. The potential outcome could be a medical-grade at-home collection blood collection for remote and decentralizing screening.</p>\n<p>The outcome of the project was the development of the Samplla device along with its drying components and the modifying atmospheric packaging to isolate the collected blood sample from the ambient atmosphere. The Samplla device and stabilizing system are seen in the enclosed image. This device enables the collection of whole blood via a finger pricking with a lancet, separating the blood cells and the plasma, drying the samples, and stabilizing the sample until lab analysis.</p>\n<p>To identify the exact conditions for sample loading, stabilization, and extraction we developed a non-infectious RNA model based on human RNA. Using this model and RT-PCR/qPCR analysis we were able to extract 99% of the loaded RNA in serum samples and stabilized it for 7 days in comparison to ~35% after 1 day and less than 5% after 4 days without the Samplla device. However, when we tried to repeat this excellent recovery condition with HCV in both in vivo model and HCV positive samples from human patients the maximum recovery was in the range of 40-50% which does not enable an accurate measurable. This major difference is probably due to the fact that in our human RNA model we worked with naked RNA while viral RNA is protected by a protein envelope (capsid). Although we tried various conditions were with our collaborator at Loyola University Chicago were unable to obtain better results. Unfortunately, this outcome is insufficient to support further development of this the HCV RNA project.</p>\n<p>We have tried using another Samplla format (Samplla S) to load RNA urine samples. Cells shed into the urine are a potential source of material for direct yet noninvasive bladder evaluation.&nbsp;Bladder biopsies are an invasive and expensive way to detect RNA and DNA. In addition, RNA degradation from RNase enzymes present in the environment makes it difficult to implement gene expression profiling from urine samples collected in clinical settings. Initial results showed that this direction may be feasible and we may be able to utilize the RNA extraction method from the Samplla device for noninvasive bladder RNA/DNA evaluations. Further development is required to validate these initial results.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/13/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Avinoam&nbsp;Dukler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051967/2051967_10716874_1657760905159_SampllaXwhitecrop--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051967/2051967_10716874_1657760905159_SampllaXwhitecrop--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Samplla Device\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051967/2051967_10716874_1657760905159_SampllaXwhitecrop--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Samplla Device\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Samplla device enables precise whole blood collection, cell separation, drying and preserving of the plasma for lab analysis.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kepler Diagnosis, Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Avinoam&nbsp;Dukler</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Samplla Device</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051967/2051967_10716874_1657761216054_Foilbag_small--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051967/2051967_10716874_1657761216054_Foilbag_small--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Samplla Foil bag\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051967/2051967_10716874_1657761216054_Foilbag_small--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Samplla Foil bag\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Once the blood sample is loaded, while it is still wet, the Samplla device is placed into the foil bag that includes humidity and oxygen absorbent that accelerate the drying process of the sample inside.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kepler Diagnosis, Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Avinoam&nbsp;Dukler</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Samplla Foil bag</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051967/2051967_10716874_1657761627488_SampllaMAPPIC--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051967/2051967_10716874_1657761627488_SampllaMAPPIC--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Samplla MAP\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051967/2051967_10716874_1657761627488_SampllaMAPPIC--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Samplla MAP\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The modifying atmospheric packaging (MAP) isolates the Samplla device within the foil bag from the ambient atmopsere to preserve its condition and prevent gases exchange.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">VDI Laboratories, LLC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Avinoam&nbsp;Dukler</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Samplla MAP</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051967/2051967_10716874_1657763146263_SampllaSDEVICE--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051967/2051967_10716874_1657763146263_SampllaSDEVICE--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Samplla S\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2051967/2051967_10716874_1657763146263_SampllaSDEVICE--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Samplla S\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Samplla S enable to collect and preserve serum samples without sample manipulation (like cel separation).
