 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diatoms are a type of microscopic marine algae that form the base of the ocean food web and generate about 20% of the oxygen on the planet. Admired since the Victorian age, these organisms are often referred to as the \u2018glass houses of the sea\u2019 because of the intricate architecture of their cell walls made of silicon dioxide, or glass. When these organisms die, the cellular-associated carbon and other elements can be either recycled and reused by other phytoplankton or, because glass is heavier than seawater, lost by sinking out of the surface ocean. Thus, the contribution diatoms make to carbon cycling is dictated by the balance between the factors that facilitate recycling and those that stimulate export. As the most abundant entity in the ocean, viruses have, for decades, been characterized as efficient recyclers, acting as \u2018shunts\u2019 by preventing the transfer of energy up the food chain through host mortality and lysis. However, it has been suggested that viruses may also act as \u2018shuttles\u2019 to the deep ocean, stimulating cellular processes that facilitate sinking. This project is testing this emerging hypothesis and determining how different nutrient regimes influence the fate of diatoms through impacts on viral infection dynamics and death. This is particularly timely given major national and international initiatives currently seeking to quantify how ecosystem interactions regulate carbon export in the ocean. Results of this project have the potential to challenge the canonical role of diatom viruses in carbon cycling and transform the understanding of host-virus interactions in the ocean. This project provides critical funding support for a soft-money, underrepresented, female oceanographer, as well a graduate student and undergraduates. Proposed fieldwork leverages a Rutgers and European Union-funded project, fostering ongoing collaborations with researchers at the Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn in Naples, Italy. To facilitate ocean literacy, the PIs are working with the Rutgers\u2019 Education and Outreach team to conduct a series of Teen Cafes focused on carbon cycling, phytoplankton, and viruses utilizing the \u2018Tools of Science\u2019 (ToS), a series of educational videos and lesson plans designed to introduce middle, high school, and undergraduate students in underrepresented and underserved communities to core scientific practices. \r\n\r\nDiatoms contribute almost 40% of marine primary productivity, dominating the biological pump and disproportionately contributing to carbon export due to the ballasted nature of a silica-based cell wall. The contribution of diatoms to carbon sequestration is dictated by the balance between upper ocean remineralization and sinking, yet we still cannot explain widespread spatio-temporal variability in diatom-mediated export. As the most abundant predatory entities in the ocean, viruses play a critical role in shaping microbial ecosystems and driving global biogeochemical cycles. The premise of this proposal is that nutrient regimes drive the biogeochemical consequences of diatom host-virus interactions. For decades, the role of viruses as \u2018shunts\u2019, redirecting particulate matter away from higher trophic levels and into the dissolved fraction through host lysis, has dominated microbial ecology and marine virology. However, the idea that viruses may also act as \u2018shuttles\u2019, facilitating carbon export by stimulating aggregation and/or ballast production, is now emerging as a potential mechanism for carbon flux. This project is conducting laboratory-based studies on diverse diatom host-virus systems and manipulative studies on natural diatom communities to compare the impact of viral infection on processes that facilitate sinking \u2013 mineral ballast production and particle aggregation \u2013 to those that stimulate remineralization \u2013 bacterial-mediated hydrolysis and subsequent remineralization of diatom particulate organic matter and silica. Taken together, this work is characterizing the relative balance between these diametrically opposing outcomes within the ecophysiological context of nutrient regime (specifically, silicon and iron limitation), ultimately elucidating the impact of viral infection on the fate of diatom organic matter in the ocean.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
