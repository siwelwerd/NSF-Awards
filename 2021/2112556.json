 "awd_abstract_narration": "Center for Biological Signatures and Sensing\r\n\r\nThe Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program supports the enhancement of research capabilities of minority-serving institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research.  CREST promotes the development of new knowledge, enhancements of the research productivity of individual faculty, and an expanded presence of students historically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines.  With National Science Foundation support, Fisk University strengthens the Center for Biological Signatures and Sensing (BioSS).  The Center develops sensor technology that increases the knowledge and development of biological, chemical, and nuclear sensors for biological applications.  Each of three research areas engages a multidisciplinary team of natural scientists partnering with mathematicians and computer scientists to develop or adapt new tools to solve high profile biological problems.  The Center enhances Fisk University curricula to include emerging topics in biological sensors and materials science.  The project provides research experience, professional development, mentoring and career guidance for a diverse and new generation of students in the emerging areas of sensor technology.   \r\n\r\nThe Center articulates three research subprojects addressing biological sensing modalities that are the basis of the next generation of sensors serving a multitude of applications.  Subproject 1 focuses on genetic signatures and sensing of cellular identity and function in dopamine neurons in actively proliferating mammalian cells.  This team uses various combinations of genetically encoded sensors, transcriptional profiling, and microfluidics to determine epigenetic modifiers of gene expression, and therefore of cellular function and behavior.  Subproject 2 develops biochemical mechanisms of metal sensing from structure-function relationships of proteins to cellular homeostasis. This team integrates biophysical, biochemical, and computational approaches to reveal the molecular basis for protein-metal interactions and their role in the regulation of fundamental biological processes, extending previous work focused on manganese to include iron, copper, and zinc.  Subproject 3 develops and implements novel radiation sensors for biological applications. This team continues the material discovery component and further develops dual-energy x-ray absorptivity handheld sensors and micro-cameras providing chemical specificity, detection of biogenetic molecules, and other assays involving gamma and neutron spectroscopy applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
