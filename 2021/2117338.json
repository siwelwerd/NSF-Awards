 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Central Michigan University is acquiring a 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with an automatic sample loader and a temperature control system to support research of Dr. Benjamin Swarts and colleagues Anja Mueller, Janice Tomasik, Choon Y Lee and Wenjun Du. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as permitting study of chemically and biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution as well as collaborators from regional community colleges.\r\n\r\nThe award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts studies of carbohydrate/lipid synthesis, creating chemical tools to study bacteria and generating polysaccharide-based renewable materials. The instrumentation is also used to search for antioxidant materials obtained from dendrimer and characterizing products for the synthesis of polymer (including polysaccharide)-based fuel cells and skin scaffolds. In addition, it allows the characterization of polymeric nitric oxide release architectures and exploration of redox enzyme mechanisms. The instrument also serves researchers creating polymer/dendrimer-based materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
