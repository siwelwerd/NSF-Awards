 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Northern Illinois University is acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer to support research of Professor Evgueni Nesterov and colleagues Narayan Hosmane, Ralph Wheeler, Douglas Klumpp and Timothy Hagen. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as permitting study of chemically and biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution as well as collaborators from regional primarily undergraduate institutions.\r\n\r\nThe award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts studies developing synthetic organic methodology and transition metal and super-acid catalyzed reactions. The instrumentation is also used for fundamental studies in organic photochemistry and the design and study of small-molecule ligands for protein binding. In addition, it allows the development of an analytical platform for fluorescent screening of enzyme inhibitors and studies on the methods of controlled preparation of semiconducting polymer materials and advanced dual-function organic light-emitting diode (OLED) compounds.  The instrument also serves researchers developing environmentally friendly industrially relevant catalytic processes and reactions and those designing oligonucleotide-based molecular switches. The NMR spectrometer is employed in the characterization of synthesized boron-carbon cage compounds which are used in neutron-capture therapy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
