The developed space solar panels may have substantially lower cost compared to the state-of-practice space solar panels and will be compatible with automated high-volume manufacturing.  The panels will meet the requirements of the growing satellite manufacturing industry. The main customers include manufacturers of satellites for large scale satellite constellations and manufacturers of large-size spacecraft, as well as space agencies and private companies developing infrastructure for space, Moon and Mars exploration. Applications on Earth could include powering long-endurance drones (airplanes and airships) and remote facilities that need more compact and lighter weight solar solutions for off-grid power systems.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop novel space-stable and scalable packaging technologies for ultrathin silicon solar cells.  The project will develop a prototype solar blanket and demonstrate its integration into ultracompact solar array deployment systems.  Specific objectives of this Phase II project are to: (1) establish routine production of ultrathin silicon solar cells, (2) develop low-stress metal interconnects for thin silicon solar cells, (3) develop a cover glass replacement coating for thin silicon solar cells, (4) demonstrate mini-blankets with acceptable cell-to-module efficiency loss, (5) electrically and mechanically integrate silicon solar blanket, and (6) demonstrate deployment of the relevant size blanket while conducting preliminary stress testing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
