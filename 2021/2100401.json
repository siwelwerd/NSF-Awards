 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by paving the way to creating a technical workforce that is able to function effectively in highly collaborative, diverse environments. Enhanced ability to nurture these skills and abilities will occur through development of measurement instruments, a novel curriculum, and research into the impacts of the curriculum. The project seeks to align with the EHR Core Research (ECR) program's intent by reflecting the interdisciplinarity of computational thinking (CT) and encouraging critical reflection with respect to the historical role of women and people of color in computer science (CS) and robotics. This project moves the traditional CS curriculum beyond the screen and back to its tangible roots to support learning, collaboration, and participation in CS. In this project, the newly crafted CS curriculum will engage undergraduates in the construction, programming, and use of a robotic loom, foregrounding the inherently interdisciplinary nature of CT in a formal CS curriculum. The project activities expect to broaden participation and collaboration in CS and STEM, redefining what counts as a valuable learning activity in CS education. \r\n\r\nGrounded in the learning sciences and embodied cognition, this project will further the development of interdisciplinarity and address key challenges to diversity in computing. The project activities will interweave iterative Design-Based Research with periodic experimental research experiments to test the efficacy of the robotic loom designs and course materials for undergraduate learning of interdisciplinarity and collaborative computing. To ensure that the proposed designs effectively complement curricular and practical realities, the project team will consult with an advisory board, the undergraduates, and the participating institution's curriculum advisory boards to inform design and development throughout the project period. This project is supported by the ECR program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
