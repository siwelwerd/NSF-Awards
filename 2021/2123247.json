 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the growing public awareness of climate change, Houston, the energy capital of the world, is undertaking efforts to lead the energy transition for a more sustainable and cleaner environment. There is urgent demand for a data science workforce equipped with broad understanding for optimizing conventional energy and leading the energy transition. This project focuses on training undergraduates and Masters-level students from diverse backgrounds to achieve a wide range of knowledge and skill sets essential for the future energy industry workforce. Five major public universities in greater Houston are teamed up with multiple energy industry partners, ranging from large oil and gas companies to startups on energy sector data analytics. Given the emphasis of participating universities on diversity and equity and the diverse student populations they serve, this project broadens training opportunities for groups historically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).\r\n\r\nStatisticians, computer scientists, geophysicists, and social scientists at the University of Houston (UH) main campus, UH-Downtown, UH-Victoria, UH-Clear Lake, and Sam Houston State University are collaborating to develop year-long educational activities under the theme of energy transition, from traditional oil- and gas-related problems to renewable energy. The curriculum contains an array of important topics including fundamental science and engineering understanding, essence of statistics and machine learning methods, and practical skill sets of programming and data visualization. Social science aspects on the energy transition and its implications for society are also included in the curriculum. The program consists of: (1) five-week summer boot camps with educational modules on statistics/machine learning, CS/programming, geophysics and earth sciences, public policy, and engineering; (2) advanced courses and micro-credential training offered by participating universities in the following fall semester; (3) semester-long team research projects on problems provided by industry partners in the spring semester; and (4) summer internships and/or conference presentation opportunities to conclude the program. Each year, about 40 students participate in the program, totaling about 120 student participants over 3 cohorts. A framework in which research projects can be carried out is developed. The project also promotes interaction and collaboration between academia and industry in the region, opening up more opportunities for education and research collaboration. All project data is well documented and made freely available. The student and program-level outcomes are formally assessed, with results disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
