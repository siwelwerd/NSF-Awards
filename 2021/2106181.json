 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Targeted Infusion Projects (TIP) support the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. This project at the Fayetteville State University is intended to develop an Interdisciplinary Materials Science Graduate Certificate Program (IMS-GCP). The intent of the project is to provide undergraduate students at Fayetteville State University the opportunity to participate in collaborative research projects that will contribute to materials science knowledge, enhance the research capacity at Fayetteville State University and strengthen an existing collaboration with Tuskegee University.     \r\n\r\nThis TIP project has four goals: (1) to develop and implement IMS-GCP to strengthen undergraduate STEM education through a bridging approach with Tuskegee University (TU); (2) to enhance research and education infrastructure for materials research and education; (3) to increase student enrollment in IMS-GCP at FSU and number of FSU graduates to enter graduate programs at TU; and (4) to develop research capacities in two areas of polymers and biomaterials through research collaborations with TU. This project will be conducted collaboratively at two HBCUs. It will facilitate undergraduate career development so that undergraduates are better prepared for graduate studies or professional STEM careers. Faculty and students are supported to work collaboratively on mechanical and tribological properties of green polymers to develop natural, biodegradable, low-cost, and competitive new materials, which are expected to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
