 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current software for user authentication relies on the user to directly initiate some interaction (i.e., active authentication). However, active authentication systems are not accessible to individuals across all age groups. Continuous authentication schemes transparently observe a user's natural multimodal behaviors to leverage all possible signals as input for authentication, and hence do not require explicit authentication interactions to be initiated by the user, and are thus a promising framework for authentication by individuals of different age groups. This project's novelties are 1) to advance understanding of how individuals of different age groups use and perceive existing authentication methods, especially concerning users' mental models and acceptance of monitoring for the purposes of continuous authentication, and 2) to collect and analyze a variety of user signals in multiple behavioral and physiological modalities for age-aware continuous authentication on personal computing devices. This research also informs the design of continuous authentication interactions in other contexts such as public spaces and other smart environments, in which continuous authentication might be useful. \r\n\r\nThe research includes three phases. (1) Elicit the mental models multi-generational users have of what it means to authenticate to a system, if and when they expect the system to re-authenticate them to confirm their identity as they continue to interact, and if and how they expect to receive feedback of authentication attempts. (2) Produce a novel dataset of behavioral and physiological data, such as touch gestures, keystroke dynamics, heart-rate variability, and skin temperature, through a series of data collection sessions wherein individuals of different age groups will be recruited to complete a diverse set of tasks. (3) Develop fundamental knowledge of age-aware continuous authentication through the analysis of these data using state-of-the-art machine and deep learning techniques. This project broadens participation in computing by involving students underrepresented in STEM and through K-12 outreach.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

An exhaustive literature review was also conducted to explore the state of the field regarding users' needs, expectations, and abilities related to security and authentication, particularly across different age groups, including children and older adults.

The participants included 3 individuals aged 17 and under, 18 aged 18 to 29, 4 aged 30 to 49, and 7 aged 50 or older. They engaged in various tasks across three lab sessions using a Lenovo workstation and a OnePlus smartphone, with data passively collected throughout. Tasks included essay writing, password entry, recipe search, mock credential generation, and text messaging, capturing both fixed and free-form keystroke, mouse, and touch dynamics (Multi-ID Dataset). The Context-Based CA Dataset includes data from wearable sensors and cameras, recording physiological signals such as accelerometer data, skin temperature, heart rate, electrodermal activity, and facial expressions. Participants viewed videos designed to elicit specific emotions (Sad, Content, Disgust, Happy) and self-reported their emotional responses using a custom Android app. Each session, lasting approximately 20 minutes, was spaced an average of 13 days apart, and participants received $35 e-gift cards per session.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We also developed a continuous authentication scheme utilizing the Context-Based CA Dataset.

For electrical signals, we trained Explainable Boosting Machines (EBM), which strike a balance between the expressiveness of black-box models and the interpretability of linear models. For image-based authentication, we employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pretrained on the VGG Face dataset to extract features from cropped images. These features were then processed by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and optimized using a Supervised Contrastive Loss, which maximized the distance between features of different classes and minimized the distance between features of the same class. During testing, the CNN backbone was frozen, and the latent features were fed into an MLP classifier to make authentication decisions. For electrical signals, the data was split session-wise, with sessions 1 and 2 used for training and session 3 for validation, ensuring robustness against long-term persistence of signals.
