 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wildfire is a natural feature of healthy forest ecosystems. There is concern because the frequency and intensity of these events are increasing as our climate warms. Among their many impacts, wildfire disturbances impact the microorganisms present in forest soils that catalyze a series of key ecosystem processes, ranging from the establishment of tree seedlings to the cycling of carbon and nitrogen. Research to date has revealed that the composition of soil microbiomes is altered by wildfire, but critical information is lacking on how increasingly severe wildfires in western US forests will affect the recovery of soil microbial communities, with cascading impacts on forest ecosystems. This research uses a unique series of burn pile scars in a lodgepole pine forest in northern Colorado as a proxy for the decadal recovery of the soil environment following severe wildfire. The work will use diverse microbiological and geochemical analyses to determine how soil chemistry and microbiomes change up to 50-years following fire. Insights gained here will assist with forest management following severe wildfire in the western US and will be incorporated into new educational opportunities at the participating research institutions. The project will enrich a variety of courses taught by the researchers, include training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and provide cooperative extension to forest managers as well as public outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThere is an increasing appreciation that changing wildfire regimes may drive long-term alterations in both above- and below-ground ecosystem structure. This research will investigate the resilience of soil microbiomes (i.e., their ability to return to pre-fire levels) following severe wildfire in lodgepole pine forests, (2) the functional implications of shifts in microbiome structure, and (3) the ability of altered soil microbiomes to support tree regeneration via rhizosphere interactions. Together, this research will test the hypothesis that altered soil chemical and physical properties drive the soil microbiome to an alternate steady state following severe wildfire, with implications for the establishment of new pine seedlings and subsequent ecosystem recovery. To test this, the work leverages a unique experimental opportunity consisting of burn pile scars throughout a forest ecosystem, thus ensuring that the chrono-sequence controls for fuel type and load, elevation, climate, and aspect. Furthermore, the approach integrates diverse analytical tools including metagenomic interrogations of soil microbiomes, mass-spectrometry characterization of soil chemistry, and vegetation manipulation greenhouse experiments. Together, our results will represent the first insights into the extent of resilience of burned soil microbiomes across a 50-year post-fire recovery period, and the ability of lodgepole pine seedlings to recruit beneficial rhizosphere communities that aid in tree re-establishment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Soil microbial communities, which drive biogeochemical cycles and partner in mycorrhizal symbiosis with lodgepole pines, play critical roles in the ability of these forests to survive and regenerate in the face of simultaneous global change threats. How soil microbial communities are influenced by fire severity and soil depth and how they recover over time in lodgepole pine forests with existing insect-driven mortality remains an open question.&nbsp; Here, we sampled two soil depths (0-5 and 5-15 cm) and various burn severities across a ten-year wildfire chronosequence in the Southern Rocky Mountains. We used the most current next generation molecular methods for microbiomes to assess changes in both bacterial and fungal biomass and community composition. High severity fires consistently reduced both fungal and bacterial abundance, whereas the response to low severity fires was more variable. Fire also reduced fungal and bacterial richness, but this reduction was more pronounced in recent fires. Fungal and bacterial community structure were both affected by fire severity, and varied across time, but only fungal communities were affected in both soil depths. These changes were driven by increased abundance of pyrophilous &ldquo;fire-loving&rdquo; fungi and bacteria in burned plots, particularly in recent fires, and by reductions in symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi, which did not rebound over time.&nbsp; The effect of fire severity on bacterial and fungal community composition and fungal abundance and richness persisted for at least 10 years whereas bacterial abundance and richness partially recovered after 5 years.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Further, we used pine seedlings to assay whether lack of ectomycorrhizal fungi symbiotically associated with the tree roots limited pine forest regeneration after high severity fires.

Our results indicate that lack of ectomycorrhizal fungi does indeed limit pine tree regeneration in Colorado forests that have experienced both high severity fires and high mortality due to bark beetles.
