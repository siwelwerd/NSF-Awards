 "awd_abstract_narration": "The deep seafloor covers two-thirds of Earth\u2019s surface area, but there is limited understanding of the deep-ocean ecosystems and resources and the ability of these ecosystems to withstand human impacts. Human uses such as deep-sea mining and carbon sequestration are poised to fundamentally alter physical, chemical, and biological conditions of the seafloor and surrounding environments. These activities have the potential to rival negative effects from bottom fishing and other human impacts to the deep sea, yet the science to inform and evaluate the impacts of these new industries is lacking. The Crustal Ocean Biosphere Research Accelerator (COBRA) project connects diverse stakeholders and experts \u2013 interdisciplinary academic and government scientists, private institutions, policy makers, industry experts and other stakeholders \u2013 through virtual meetings to coordinate efforts. The goal is to generate new knowledge and inform decision-making relating to emergent industrial uses of the deep ocean and decrease the likelihood of serious harm to the environment while maintaining the broad benefits that society currently enjoys.\r\n\r\nThe COBRA network of networks has nine key partners that bring access to international science and crustal ocean exploration assets (Ocean Exploration Trust, Schmidt Ocean Institute, Ocean Networks Canada, Cluster Ocean Floor at MARUM, and C-DeepSea), to experts that provide science-based recommendations to policy makers (Deep Ocean Stewardship Initiative working groups, including the Challenger 150 program), to governmental groups responsible for assessing crustal ocean resources (USGS Global Marine Minerals Group), and to experts in team science (CREDITS program). COBRA unites these partners in a common mission to accelerate research on the structure, function, resilience, and ecosystem services of the crustal ocean biosphere to inform decision making. COBRA will help to close knowledge gaps by facilitating dedicated and coordinated expedition and observatory efforts combined with emergent characterization approaches. In parallel, COBRA will train at least 50 globally distributed early-career researchers in ocean exploration, science, and policy through innovative virtual expedition leadership training and support two dozen international research exchanges that promote team science collaboration, diversity, equity, and inclusivity. COBRA will also establish a web-based search portal that points to all data types deposited in appropriate internationally accessible data repositories to promote data discovery and accelerate knowledge transfer and collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) program is designed to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and prepare the next generation of U.S. researchers for multiteam international collaborations. The AccelNet program supports strategic linkages among U.S. research networks and complementary networks abroad that will leverage research and educational resources to tackle grand scientific challenges that require significant coordinated international efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
