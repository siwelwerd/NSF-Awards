 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines social processes underlying deviance on digital platforms. New forms of digital communication have fundamentally shifted the arenas and mechanics of public conversations. Widespread adoption of voting systems and user-managed communities on social media can create group processes that normalize and protect societally unacceptable ideas and behaviors. This grand shift begs for a research agenda on deviance with a new theoretical scope and empirical relevance. Drawing on linguistic and sociological theory and computational methods, the project will enhance our knowledge of the mechanisms and determinants of online deviant behavior and extremism.  Findings will serve the public interest by shedding light on governance decisions that affect behavior in online public spaces. \r\n\r\nA complete conversation database of posts and comments from a large online information-sharing and discussion website will be used to investigate the empirical puzzle of divergence and polarization on digital platforms. The main theoretical aim is to understand a transition to deviant ideologies or behaviors within communities in which non-deviance is the norm and actively enforced by members. The central hypothesis is that deviant communities create localized conversations and incentive structures in which cultural meanings of deviant linguistic codes and extremist behaviors can be formed, shared, and enforced. The project will explore the conditions and processes of the transition by connecting micro-level conversation dynamics with macro-level ecological competition. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1) What conversational dynamics underlie the shifts in linguistic conventions, normative standards, and cultural interpretations of deviance? 2) How do inter-community interaction and exclusion contribute to group deviation and polarization? By simultaneously adjusting the lens at the conversational level and ecological level, the project aims to offer a set of middle-range theories explaining the emergence and solidification of deviant, and in certain cases extremist, behavior in online public spaces.  This award is supported by the Sociology, Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace, and Human Networks and Data Science \u2013 Research Programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The analysis revealed a substantial increase in anger-related language and profanity among incels over time, indicating a shift towards heightened emotional engagement, while the emotional expressions of outsiders remained relatively stable. We observed a significant decrease in cognitive processing language within incel discourse, dropping from 11-12% to 8.8%, suggesting a reduction in critical thinking and deliberation among community members. Additionally, the use of first-person plural pronouns (&ldquo;we&rdquo;) increased among incels, reflecting a stronger collective identity, while outsiders tended to use first-person singular pronouns (&ldquo;I&rdquo;), indicating a more individualistic perspective. The topic modeling analysis highlighted a marked rise in discussions around core incel ideologies, particularly topics like &ldquo;Chad and Stacy,&rdquo; which surged from 1.3% to 4.7% of all content, suggesting a deeper entrenchment in narratives. Conversely, topics related to daily life challenges experienced a decline, indicating a shift towards ideological absolutism and disengagement from real-world issues. The project identified a phenomenon of thematic bundling where discussions about core ideologies and physical traits were frequently interwoven, which discourages engagement with diverse perspectives and solidifying the cultural boundaries within the community. Furthermore, the analysis of post-reply dynamics in threaded conversations confirmed that parent posts discussing incel ideologies generated more replies on similar topics, indicating a shift towards more extreme viewpoints, particularly in later stages of community discourse. The results found that a &ldquo;community of identity&rdquo; interaction style, characterized by specific speech norms, contributes to the proliferation of extreme content, as participants increasingly adhered to certain topics, fostering an environment conducive to radical ideologies. Statistical analyses revealed that moderation within the communities suppressed critical viewpoints, allowing deviant ideologies to proliferate. This selective enforcement of community guidelines may have contributed to the entrenchment of extremist norms and ideologies.
