 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the summer of 2021, the Polymath Jr. program will provide research opportunities to hundreds of undergraduates from different backgrounds. It will also train a group of graduate students in mentoring undergraduate research. This highly inclusive program will support students who do not have research opportunities, due to the pandemic or for other reasons. It is an online program that employs modern virtual tools: meetings with Zoom, a dedicated Wiki site, Overleaf, and a Discord server.\r\n\r\nThe program consists of at least 12 research projects in a variety of mathematical subfields: number theory, combinatorics, representation theory, commutative algebra, complex analysis, and more. Each project includes a professor who is an expert in the relevant field, additional graduate student mentors, and 20-30 undergraduate students. Some projects focus on proof writing, others involve programming, applied problems, exploring large spaces of examples, and so on. The goal of this variety is to provide opportunities for students with very different interests and backgrounds.\r\n\r\nhttps://geometrynyc.wixsite.com/polymathreu\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
