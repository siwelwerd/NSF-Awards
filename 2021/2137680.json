 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made as part of the FY 2021 Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (MPS-Ascend). Each fellowship supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical and physical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. This fellowship to Dr. Andrei Gasic supports his research project entitled \u201cActive Glass Theory for Dendritic Spine Plasticity.\" The host institution for the fellowship is Rice University, and the sponsoring scientists is Dr. Peter G. Wolynes.\r\n\r\nDr. Gasic proposes to develop a theoretical framework to model the morphological plasticity of dendritic spines as an \u201cactive glass\u201d. The active glass theory will be used to examine the mechanical properties of the underlying actin network of the spine, such as the stress response as it grows in response to signals. In addition, the relation between the chemical reaction dynamics of gelation and the elastic properties of the network glass will be examined. This new theoretical framework will be validated through extensive numerical simulations. This will also be useful for understanding cellular condensates or membraneless organelles. The fellow will participate as a mentor for the Frontiers In Science (FIS) summer research program, which recruits from minority-serving institutions, and he will continue to be an advocate for underrepresented students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
