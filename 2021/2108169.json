 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dark matter and dark energy make up 95% of the Universe, yet the physics governing these components is not well understood. Weak lensing, the bending of light as it passes by mass in the Universe, is one of the most powerful tools for studying dark matter and dark energy. Weak lensing measurements from the recent Universe have been found to be discrepant with cosmic microwave background measurements from the early Universe, which may indicate that our understanding of cosmology is incomplete. The investigators will assemble an independent weak lensing data set using public observations covering a new area of sky comparable to the largest state-of-the-art weak lensing surveys. These data will be used to perform an independent analysis and directly address the tension between measurements of the Universe at early and recent times. This program will be part of the education for a diverse group of students. It will also include outreach efforts that share cosmology with the public by combining art and science in collaboration with Adler Planetarium and the Space Explorers program. \r\n\r\nThe investigators will use public data from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at the NSF\u2019s Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory to generate a new weak lensing shear catalog containing approximately 80 million galaxies. This new catalog will be used to perform an independent cosmic shear analysis, which connects weak lensing measurements to cosmological model parameters. The dataset will cover 5,000 sq. deg. of sky outside of the footprint of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). This investigation will provide a statistically independent cross-check of recent cosmic shear analyses from DES and other surveys. Furthermore, when combined with DES, this program will provide a shear catalog that covers 10,000 sq. deg. of sky, giving access to cosmological scales that have not been explored by current weak lensing surveys. The public release of processed DECam data will increase scientific accessibility for amateur and professional astronomers. In particular, it will help the community prepare for early data from the NSF-funded Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nCosmic shear results from weak gravitational lensing of background galaxies by the intervening mass distribution along the line of sight to us. Observationally, what we see is that the shapes of galaxies are slightly distorted. A statistical analysis of the observed galaxy shapes can be used to make a map of that mass distribution and then compared to cosmological simulations. With increased sensitivity of the survey data and increased area, more galaxies can be measured with higher accuracy and the subsequent analyses more tightly constrain how well a given simulation matches the observations. The overall goal is to use such investigations to understand the physical conditions and processes that govern the structure and evolution of the Universe.\r\n\n\nThis NSF award (AST 2108169) supports the data reduction and data management portion of a project to measure the cosmic shear signalindependent of similar measurements being made by the Dark Energy Survey (DES). Most of the actual cosmological analyses in this program are supported through the collaborative award (AST 2108168).\r\n\n\nThe chief differences when compared to, similar, on-going analyses (e.g. that being carried out by DES) is that we are using archival images from a variety of independent community observing programs, taken with independent methods and goals, of the area not surveyed by DES. This results in an independent set of data, but one that is much less homogenous since the observations were made with a broad range of goals.\r\n\n\nThis program has supported the data processing of more than 200,000 DECam exposures (a further 100,000 came from an exploratory program supported by NCSA). We have then combined (stacked) those processed images to form coadded images that cover roughly 16,000 square degrees of the sky in four optical bands and then analyzed the images to detect objects. Principally these are foreground stars and background galaxies and we first measure their locations, sizes and brightness. This resulted in an initial catalog of 1.9 billion objects. We then used that catalog as the input for a second measurement process to make detailed measurements of the size, shape and brightness of each object, taking into account the precise observing conditions at the time of the individual observations that were combined to detect each object. This forms the input for the shear signal analyses which refine the shape measurements and compare those results to the same measurement process for simulated objects injected into the images.\r\n\n\nThe data processing and management portion of this program are essential not just to producing, serving and organizing the data but also tracking systematic effects from: the camera, the observing conditions, and the processing and measurement procedures themselves. These must be tracked because they subtly impact the results and the effects of these instrumental and environmental biases must be understood and accounted for in the end results.\r\n\n\nBeside the funded goals of this grant, the data processing and management have allowed us to make our resulting images and catalogs available to the general astronomical community and enable a wide variety of other investigations. The best example is the DELVE Collaboration which are using these data products to investigate the vicinity of the Milky Way and Local Group, where they study satellite galaxies of our own, search for previously undetected faint galactic neighbors and tidally disrupted systems that are being absorbed into our galaxy.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RobertAGruendl\n"
