 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nAtmospheric, climate, ocean, earth and environmental sciences (geosciences) are among the least diverse fields in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), with Latinx scientists being significantly underrepresented. A lack of diversity in STEM fields means decreased ability to identify and solve critical issues facing society such as climate change, which disproportionately affects the populations that are least represented in STEM. Data literacy is gaining increasing relevance and importance to scientists and the general public as we aim to make informed decisions to solve locally and globally relevant problems. DIG CAMP (Data in Geosciences: Collaboration and Mentoring Program\u2014Teaming Latinx High School and College Students for Data Use in Geosciences) offers a camp-based model to support engagement with geosciences, as well as data literacy. During this project and through its sustainability plan, DIG CAMP provides opportunities for Latinx high school students to engage with authentic and locally relevant geosciences research and data; gain geosciences content knowledge; build their data literacy, critical thinking, problem solving, and collaboration skills; strengthen their identities to do science; and increase the likelihood that they will pursue academic or workplace careers in the geosciences.\r\n\r\nDIG CAMP - Data in Geosciences: Collaboration and Mentoring Program\u2014Teaming Latinx High School and College Students for Data Use in Geosciences will broaden participation in the geosciences among communities of color by developing a research-based model for overcoming long standing barriers and biases within the field. The goals of this project are to: (1) design and implement a complementary suite of informal learning experiences to actively recruit Latinx high school students into the geosciences by increasing their engagement, capacity building, and opportunities for continuity in the discipline; (2) provide Latinx undergraduate geosciences majors with meaningful outreach and mentoring opportunities that engage them with communities, and increase their retention in geosciences fields of study and careers; and, (3) support high school students and their undergraduate mentors to build science and data literacy skills and engage with locally relevant geosciences research data to increase their efficacy and success in college and the geosciences workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Undergraduates who were interested or majoring in environmental or geosciences reported that the field trips provided important exposure to jobs and careers in geosciences that they had not yet experienced in college.\r\n\n\nThe final stages of the DIG CAMP project created a long-term sustainability and scale up plan leveraging the partnership between the UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, and the school district. Together, we envisioned ways that high school students throughout the district could access some of the benefits of DIG CAMP by partnering teachers with community geosciences partners to design and implement locally relevant, data-rich geosciences curriculum units across all science content areas. Input from DIG CAMP participants highlighted several strategies that should be utilized in a new project with teachers at scale, including: (1) attending to and assessing the multifaceted nature of science identity; (2) designing for belonging, especially by incorporating family into projects and learning and by exposure to diverse members of the STEM workforce; (3) incorporate hands-on and personally meaningful projects, especially in relation to the local community; and (4) finding opportunities to discuss the interconnected and interdisciplinary aspects of climate change in local communities and with STEM professionals. This plan led to the Data in Geosciences In Teaching project (NSF #2325493).\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/03/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AdinaPaytan\n"
