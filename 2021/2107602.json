 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the NSF Division of Chemistry, Professor Michael Pluth of the University of Oregon will develop general methods to bind, differentiate, and recognize under-investigated anionic sulfur-, oxygen-, and nitrogen-containing species. These small molecules play diverse and important roles in biological systems and the environment. This research aims to gain a better fundamental understanding of how these species behave in different systems. Through conducting this interdisciplinary research, graduate and undergraduate students will receive training in organic synthesis and analytical studies in supramolecular chemistry.  In addition, the research team will engage students in local underserved middle schools in hands-on science activities to expand their exposure to STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael Pluth and his research team will investigate the molecular recognition of anionic reactive sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen species, such as peroxynitrite, nitrite, thionitrite, and perthionitrite. This project will focus on three specific aims. In Aim 1, synthetic anion-binding hosts will be used to elucidate the factors that influence binding of anionic guests including NO3- (nitrate), NO2- (nitrite), SNO- (thionitrite) and SSNO- (perthionitrite). In Aim 2, additional host receptors will be rationally designed and synthesized for specific recognition of SNO- and SSNO-. In Aim 3, the research team will investigate whether the anion-binding receptors can be used to modify the chemical speciation and reactivity of reactive small  molecules. Information gleaned from these investigations is expected to expand the understanding of what specific recognition motifs can be used to stabilize small molecule regulators and control the equilibria of their interconversion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
