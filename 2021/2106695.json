 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of \u201cchemical central processing units\u201d will make possible computation in bio-chemical contexts that can sense from the environment, process information, and actuate a physical response. Necessary to this goal are fast, robust and composable molecular components that can implement logic behavior with physical molecules, much like electronic components have been successfully used to process information. One attractive candidate is DNA Strand Displacement (DSD) circuits. Despite the promise of DSD circuits, there are a number of perceived barriers to their widespread adoption as a technology: (i) DSD circuits are slow & error-prone, (ii) preparation of DSD circuit components is difficult and does not easily scale, (iii) DSD circuit components, even when purified, contain defects, and (iv) measuring & controlling the concentration of DSD circuit components is problematic. Recent breakthroughs in \u201cleakless\u201d DSD systems have seen the first barrier fall. The project includes plans for training students at all level.\r\n\r\nThe investigators are addressing the three remaining barriers to widespread adoption of DSD circuit technology. The team of researchers is combining robust nucleic-acid circuit architectures, methods of producing long, high-fidelity single-stranded DNA, additional enzymatic methods, and new experimental protocols in order to simultaneously address all four of the identified barriers. The project intends to demonstrate that biologically amplified, enzymatically prepared DSD components lead to superior nucleic-acid logic circuits leading to entirely new applications of this technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nComputers built from biological components can directly sense (bio-)chemical signals and actuate others in a programmed response. These ``smart'' molecular systems are capable of manufacturing atomically precise nanostructures, sensitive detection of biological markers for imaging and diagnostic applications, and orchestrating complex behavior inside cells and other chemical contexts. DNA strand displacement systems (DSDs), which operate isothermally via a careful design of multiple interacting strands, have given rise to the most complex experimental demonstrations of bio-chemical computation. Recent advances have demonstrated how DSDs can, in principle, be made arbitrarily robust to spurious computation. However, those advances assume the DNA computing components that comprise the DSDs are defect-free. Defects are common during the chemical synthesis of custom designed DNA sequences and the downstream preparation of DSD components. These defects result in spurious behavior not currently addressed by recent robustness techniques.\n\n\n\nThe enzyme-free nature of DSDs result in simple computing primitives that can scale to realize large, complex systems. Meanwhile, enzymatic production of DNA can have significantly higher fidelity than sequences produced through (non-enzymatic) chemical synthesis. In this project we leveraged the simplicity of computing without enzymes, but increased the overall computation fidelity by producing the constituent DSD components through enzymatic means. Previous work in this area has placed restrictions on the molecular shape of the resulting components whereas this method, in principle, could produce components with arbitrary initial structure.\n\n\n\nBeginning from sequence verified double-stranded DNA we succeeded in producing sets of custom single-stranded DNA sequences that had exact ratios to one another. We also had initial success in producing simple DSD complexes through a multi-step protocol that includes sequence amplification and enzymatic processing to ``digest'' the precursor DNA into the target components. Challenges arose from incomplete digestion in initial approaches, but careful control experiments have yielded valuable lessons and design rules that increase success. Given the promise of this new production method we plan to build upon these project outcomes to scale both yield, fidelity and preparation of high-fidelity DSD components and entire circuits.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/02/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ChristopherThachuk\n"
