 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will directly help enhance care for the 30-to-40 million adults in the U.S. that live with anxiety disorders.  Mental health widely impacts society, with the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) reporting one-in-five adults in the U.S. experiencing a mental illness annually.  This large group forms a vastly underserved patient population that is only beginning to receive the attention needed to provide more effective solutions.  Further, the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the prevalence of these disorders and the need for improved care outcomes.  Most practicing mental health clinicians have experienced significant increases of patients seeking care for anxiety, depression, and other disorders, taxing an already overwhelmed segment of healthcare.  The proposed technology addresses needs for better methods to screen and triage patients, improve precision of pharmaceutical selection, and provide remote monitoring of health states, especially in at-risk sectors, to expand patient trending and ensure effective treatment outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project builds upon successful human research studies and pilot engineering to further the R&D of a commercially viable behavioral health vital sign.  This vital sign measure utilizes a wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor in concert with a mobile device application that allows a high-accuracy, physiological measurement of anxiety based upon brain biology.  The activities of the Phase I grant focus on one of the enabling technologies for this new vital sign: the novel EEG sensor electrodes integrated into the wearable, which allow clinical-grade brain measurements simply, in any location, and at any time.   These EEG sensor electrodes mimic the mechanical properties of human skin and have been shown through several research studies to provide high-quality signals over long durations without the use of inconvenient and messy conductive gels.  The Phase I activities will build upon this platform with a series of design and fabrication experiments to make these electrodes field replaceable by novice users and to reduce the cost to a point that is viable in the market.  Pilot wearable devices will be modified to accept these updated electrodes and user testing conducted to confirm electrical, comfort, and longevity performance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These experts identify the needs for better technologies to screen and triage patients, improve precision of pharmaceutical selection, and provide remote monitoring of health states, especially in at-risk sectors, to expand patient trending and ensure effective treatment outcomes.\n\n \n\nCogwear received Phase 1 SBIR #2110037, \"Physiological Brain Measurement for Anxiety Assessment and Trending,\" to improve the lives of the 40 million U.S. adults that live with anxiety disorders.  Our project helps advance the early-stage NSF medical device innovation goals because, presently, no solutions or vital signs exist that provide a measure of anxiety based upon underlying biology; current best practices instead utilize standardized questionnaire-based assessments of the patient's feelings as well as mental healthcare checklists based on the DSM-V.  Questionnaires are time-consuming, subject to significant reporting bias and demand effects, and lack an easy way to trend results in real-time.  \n\n \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project builds upon successful human research studies and pilot engineering to further the R&amp;D of a commercially viable behavioral health vital sign.  This measure utilizes a wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) in concert with a mobile device application that produces a high-accuracy measurement of anxiety based upon brain physiology.

These nanotechnology-derived sensor electrodes mimic the mechanical properties of skin and have been shown through several research studies to provide high-quality signals over long durations without the use of inconvenient and messy conductive gels.  Figures 1 and 2 show examples of the Cogwear wearable and a scanning electron image of the sensor surface.  \n\n \n\nTo make this vision a reality, our system and novel headgear needs to be comfortable, easy to use, and simple to maintain.  While the nanowire sensors have worked continuously in our prototype headgear and during pilot testing, we expect that the sensors will have a finite lifetime before they lose electrical conductivity from wear or lose their flexibility over time.  Further, the sensitivity to hygiene following the COVID-19 pandemic may make it desirable to change electrodes if the EEG wearable were to ever be swapped between users.

We additionally developed a revised manufacturing process to build sensor electrodes for functional and performance testing.  Finally, we created a detailed cost model of the initial and new manufacturing processes to optimize the cost structure.  Successful outcomes against both aims include: \n\n \n\nFour new electrode configurations were conceived that are capable of being easily removed and replaced by the average user, with three of these configurations being reduced to practice. \nThe three functional configurations equaled the low-noise electrical transduction performance of gold-standard Ag/AgCl wet electrodes while providing a reduction in motion artifacts up to a factor of 62 times.\nA simplified and revised manufacturing process that reduced active operator labor by 68%, decreased overall cycle time by 44%, and resulted in a 66% lower cost.\nAn electrode size analysis that proves we can reduce the size of our sensor electrodes while maintaining electrical signal quality and further reduce manufacturing costs by an additional 50%.\n\n\n \n\nThese enhancements solve one of the key R&amp;D hurdles to commercializing our wireless and mobile EEG system that brings cognitive monitoring and insights to active situations.
