 "awd_abstract_narration": "The material system of aluminum-gallium-indium-nitride makes very efficient visible light emitters but still inefficient ultraviolet emitters. As a result, the ever-increasing applications of ultraviolet light emitters in healthcare, personal hygiene, and homeland security continue to be fulfilled by conventional sources that are bulky, inefficient, and toxic. This project will take a new approach; it will combine 3-dimensional (3D) materials based on aluminum-gallium-indium-nitride with 2-dimensional (2D) materials based on boron-nitride to create new hybrid materials. These hybrid materials are expected to reduce internal light emission losses to yield ultraviolet emitters that are more than three times more efficient than the current state-of-the-art. The proposed research should make it possible to replace conventional emitters with the more efficient, smaller, safer, and more economical emitter. The project will also train  graduate students in order to retain US leadership in this technology, it will seek to encourage minority students to pursue science education, and it will generate interest in semiconductor research among undergraduate students and the public.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: Ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) emitting in the UV-C range (280nm \u2013 220 nm) are widely needed but highly inefficient. The scientific objective of the proposed research is to increase the efficiency of UV-LEDs emitting at 280 nm wavelength by investigating the integration of new materials into LED structures to create the next generation of vertically conducting devices. For the last two decades, the focus of UV-LED research was mainly to improve the material quality with an aim to increase the external quantum efficiency (EQE). The EQE is the product of internal quantum efficiency (IQE), injection efficiency (IE), and light extraction efficiency (LEE). In a typical 280 nm UV-LED, the IQE and IE are around 80%, whereas the LEE is less than 5% resulting in EQE less than 4%. The proposed project aims to increase LEE by incorporating hybrids of 2D and 3D materials into the UV-LED structures so as to reduce internal absorptions and reflections. Simulations project that the proposed scheme will dramatically improve the LEE to around 48%. Thus, it should increase the EQE by more than three times relative to the average EQE (~ 10%) of state-of-the-art 280 nm UVLED emitters. Success in this project will leap the technology forward. The project entails epitaxial growth by metal-organic chemical deposition (MOCVD), device design, processing, and material/device characterizations; it will enhance our understanding and proficiency in these fields. The graduate and undergraduate students involved in the project will become experts in these techniques as they become the next generation of researchers.\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS), and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The second activity was the graduate students' training. The third major activity was to increase public awareness/interest in STEM education.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Specific Objectives: </strong></p>\r\n<p>The specific objective was to create a 2D material, namely hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and optimize the growth of subsequent layers required to make the deep-ultraviolet (DUV) LEDs using the industry-preferred MOCVD system. Figure 1 shows the growth of the h-BN layer on the sapphire substrate; Fig. 1 (a) is the atomic force microscope (AFM) image, and Fig. 1 (b) is the x-ray diffraction. The results are similar to those reported in the literature. Figures 2 (a) &amp; (b) show the results of the high-quality AlN grown on sapphire; although the PI produced decent quality AlN on h-BN, these layers were unstable due to the 2D behavior of h-BN, as shown in Figure 2 (c) &amp; (d). Due to the lower quality than the typical AlN used to produce DUV-LEDs and the instability of the AlN on h-BN, the PI pivoted to successfully develop another important ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor, beta-gallium oxide (b-Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) in his lab with the help of NSF. Separately, the PI optimized the DUV-LED structure on a sapphire substrate and studied its temperature stability.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Significant Results: </strong></p>\r\n<p>The first layer of any DUV-LED is always the AlN, either on sapphire or bulk AlN substrates. We have published work on developing AlN using the MOCVD process, where we use nitrogen as a carrier gas instead of hydrogen; This work supported by the NSF grant was recognized by the Journal of Material Research on its cover page, as shown in Figure 3. We further developed AlGaN, including all the layers for AlGaN with different compositions, which are essential for the growth of DUV-LEDs. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Figure 4 (a) shows the transmission data Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N layers with different compositions of Al grown in PI&rsquo;s lab, which give bandgap and growth rate information that is required to produce the layer structure for DUV-LED shown in Fig. 4 (b). The results of DUV-LED electroluminescence as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. 4 (c). It is seen that the emission of LED is around 280 nm, and it is stable at a large range of temperatures up to room temperature.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong></p>\r\n<p>Over the three-year period, the project supported five graduate students, including one female, representing minorities in STEM education. Of these graduate students, two students were awarded Ph.D. degrees, and one was awarded a master's degree. Both Ph.D. students work in the semiconductor industry, one at Intel Inc. and the other at Samsung Corporation, as technology development engineers. The MS student is working in a STEM-related industry.</p>\r\n<p>The program supported a lab that used to teach several courses related to semiconductor technology and provided hands-on experience to the students. Figure 5 shows the picture of the class (ELCT 563) &ndash; Semiconductor Devices for Power, Communication, and Lighting in the PI lab. &nbsp;The project supported six undergraduate students during the summers during the project, which included two females and one African American. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The project helps educate the public by participating in university-arranged open houses, social-scholar events, and science and engineering fairs. These activities involved K-12 grade students and their families. Figure 6 shows a picture of one of the events. These events increased the curiosity of the younger generation and helped raise the parents' awareness of the values of the professions for their children in STEM.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the PI appreciates the guidance of the NSF program director, Dr. Dominique Dagnese, in the research and in upgrading the equipment to improve the infrastructure at PI&rsquo;s lab.
