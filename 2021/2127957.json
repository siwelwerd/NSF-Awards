 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the prevalence of severe diabetic foot ulcers. These ulcers affect one-fourth of patients with diabetes over their lifetimes, significantly impacting mobility and life expectancy. When treatment for an ulcer is too late, the only option is often amputation; in fact, diabetic foot ulcers account for the majority of non-traumatic lower extremity amputations. Reducing the incidence of severe ulcers will improve the health and welfare of the American public as well as mitigate the economic burden of diabetes on the American healthcare system. By some estimates, treatment for diabetic foot ulcers accounts for one-third of all direct diabetic healthcare spending. Therefore, preventing these ulcers would save the US healthcare system tens of billions of dollars per year. The proposed solution will monitor foot ulcers consistently to prevent further damage.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a computer vision system for detecting and monitoring diabetic foot ulcers with an imaging device. The current standard of care is for patients to inspect their own feet visually every day, but these inspections happen inconsistently and unreliably. If successful, this system will automatically identify patients\u2019 feet consistently across several days and lighting conditions. It will classify late-stage wounds, allowing physicians to monitor progression or healing of ulcers. Further, it will estimate the risk of future ulcers, enabling early-stage intervention.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
