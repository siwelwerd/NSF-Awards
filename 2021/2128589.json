 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern recording devices are collecting data of greater complexity and, when these data are measured over space or time, also at ever-increasing resolution.  While providing more detailed information about the associated physical phenomena occurring around us, they also pose statistical challenges related to interpretable modeling and feasible computation for such data.  Data measured over space, time, or some other continuum, are fittingly termed functional data, and constitute an important subfield of modern statistics.  This project will develop important methodology for the analysis of two types of functional data.  The first set of projects aim at the estimation of dependency patterns between components of so-called multivariate functional data, where a common set of features is measured over time for each subject in a study, such as neuroimaging scans where signals are recorded over time at a variety of spatial locations.  Another important class of functional data are samples of distributions or histograms, which regularly arise in the analysis of demographic data as mortality distributions, for example, but also in other important fields such as neuroscience and finance.  This project outlines methods for dimension reduction and regression that respect the well-known positivity and area-under-the-curve constraints for distributions, yielding interpretable data summaries and model fits that provide the practitioner with a clearer understanding of the information contained in their data.\r\n\r\nBoth fMRI and EEG yield time-dependent signals at multiple brain locations, resulting in multivariate functional data.  Quantifying connectivity patterns to define brain networks, for example in order to identify normal and pathological characteristics, is an important neuroscientific problem that can be addressed using multivariate functional data techniques.  This project seeks to advance the use of functional graphical models to estimate underlying brain dependency networks, including improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods. These methods are equally applicable in other domains that produce data of similar structure, such as longitudinal medical studies, where a common set of measurements is recorded repeatedly over time.  Also considered in this proposal are methods for distributional data, which can be thought of as collections of curves or surfaces, each corresponding to a probability distribution.  For example, neuroimaging data naturally provide such distributional samples, as levels of myelination or signal correlations within brain regions are high-dimensional data that can be effectively summarized at the subject level by a histogram or distribution.  Given a sample of such distributional data, this project investigates statistical methods of interpretable dimension reduction and dependency of distributional response functions on relevant covariates through distributional regression.  A key tool is the Wasserstein metric for distributions, which has been widely successful in applied settings, but has not been utilized to its full extent in statistics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: The statistical research projects funded by this grant can be divided into three categories: distributional data modeling, graphical modeling of functional data, and other related methodologies and applications.  The primary project completed in the first category was the development of statistically sound procedures for quantifying the significance and uncertainty of estimated effects of a collection of input variables on an outcome variable, where the outcome variable is not a single number but rather represents a distribution of values for each subject or observational unit in a study, also called distributional data.  Other projects in this area included an alternative and more flexible model for approximating the effects of input variables on distributional outcomes, a new quantification of association between two or more distributional variables, and models for distributional data that are observed serially in time.  Completed work in the second category consists of a paper that proposed a new structural assumption, the validity of which can be visually assessed for any data set, that improves the scalability of statistical methods when applied to large data sets of time (or otherwise serially) indexed observations, termed functional data, such as databanks of neuroimaging scans.  In this application area of neuroimaging, the utility of the newly proposed structure was illustrated through the construction of networks that represent connections of coordinated function across different brain areas using data from the Human Connectome Project. Outcomes in the third category are a variety of papers applying methods from the first category, other existing methods, as well as newly developed techniques to data sets consisting of distributional and functional variables, including applications to financial, biomedical, and socioeconomic data sets.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts: The activities of this grant supported the training of five different PhD students.  Of these, three wrote dissertations in which their work related to this grant figured prominently, and a fourth will do so by Summer 2023.  Two Masters students were also advised by the PI under this grant and their work on the grant formed all or part of their respective theses.  Four separate R software packages were released on CRAN that implement various methods developed under this grant.  One of these packages was co-developed with an undergraduate student at UCSB who was supervised by one of the PhD trainees, providing a valuable mentorship training opportunity to both students.   Some of the projects were published in journals designed to target non-statistical audiences to promote the use of cutting-edge statistical tools in the relevant disciplines.  Specifically, various data sets designed and/or collected to study problems in neuroscience, diabetes, physical activity in the US population, and treatment of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, among others, were analyzed using the developed statistical tools with the hope that they may be adopted in coming years by experts in these fields and be of service to them in addressing challenging issues posed by such complex data.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/17/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexander M Petersen"
