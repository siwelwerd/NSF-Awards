 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum science has attracted extensive attention in the recent years due to its potential in revolutionizing computing, telecommunication, and sensing. Native or intentional defects in wide bandgap semiconductors with spin dependent electronic transitions have demonstrated the ability to produce quantum communication, computing and sensing systems that operate at room temperature. In this project, we will study the potential of using defects in 3C silicon carbide and cubic boron nitride (both wide bandgap materials) for the fabrication of ultrasensitive electromagnetic field detectors.  These ultrasensitive detectors can be used in a multitude of versatile applications including brain signal monitoring, GPS-free navigation, and Quantum Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR).  Our initial focus will be on electric field detectors.  The literature on quantum sensing of properties 3C-Silicon (the cubic modification of silicon carbide) and cubic boron nitride is sparse or nonexistent. We anticipate that this will significantly contribute to the study of solid-state spins by demonstrating the feasibility of using 3C SiC and cBN in ultrasensitive electric and magnetic field detection. SiC has well-established industrial processes which is expected to enable fast large-scale manufacturing of the proposed devices. Cubic Boron Nitride is an emerging ultra-wide bandgap material, has similar mechanical strength as diamond and can be doped n or p type. This project will also have a major impact in the training of undergraduate and graduate students at Morgan State University (MSU), K12 students and the public on the concepts and applications of quantum information science. The proposed project will improve the existing research and STEM training infrastructure at MSU significantly by complementing the establishment of a quantum materials research center and a new Ph.D. program in Materials Science with a focus on quantum materials. The findings of the project will be broadly disseminated through publications, conference presentations, and seminars to enhance scientific and technological understanding of ultrasensitive electric and magnetic field detection using defects.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish the objectives in the proposed project, photonic crystal (PhC) structures with high quality (Q) factors (>10^3) and small mode volumes will be simulated, designed and fabricated around quantum defects in order to achieve room temperature operation by enhancing PhC cavity resonance coupled defect\u2019s Zero Phonon Line (ZPL) emission. 3C-Silicon carbide material grown on Silicon and purchased from commercial vendors as well as cBN material fabricated on diamond using our in-house growth capability will be used in this project. After growth the defects in wide bandgap materials will be characterized with photoluminescence (PL) and Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR). These materials will be fabricated into detectors of our design. The fabricated detectors will be able to detect electric fields in the millivolt m^-1 Hz^-0.5 range and magnetic fields with a sensitivity of nanotesla Hz^-0.5.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
