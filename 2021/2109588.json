 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Parallel evolution is when organisms evolve similar traits using the same ancestral genes. Detailed study of how parallel evolution works is rare, but it is important for understanding how often evolution repeats itself. One possible example of parallel evolution that would be particularly useful is heterodonty, a difference in tooth size/shape along the jaw. This feature can be observed in embryos and in fossils, providing information on its underlying genetics and evolution through deep time. Heterodonty is best known in mammals, but it has also evolved in many reptiles. This research will determine whether heterodonty develops using the same genes in mammals and reptiles. The Fellow will use \u00b5-CT scans of reptile jaws to identify their distinct tooth regions and then observe normal tooth development in reptile embryos to see if it involves the same genes as in mammals. If this is the case, these genes in reptile embryos will be blocked to assess their necessity for developing heterodonty. This research will provide the Fellow with training necessary to build a research program combining techniques from embryonic development and paleontology. Additionally, this project will involve outreach to diverse members of the public through the Yale Peabody Museum and an online video series connecting pop culture with major concepts in evolution.\r\n \r\nMammalian heterodonty is generated via regionalized expression of homeobox transcription factors in the developing dental epithelium, and this expression pattern is also known in chicks. This research will determine whether that same expression pattern was also co-opted for the development of reptilian heterodonty. The Fellow will use segmented linear regression to identify boundaries between toothrow regions in \u00b5-CT scans of heterodont reptile jaws. Then, in situ hybridization will assess whether homeobox gene expression coincides with the identified tooth regions in reptile embryos. The Fellow will also use bead implantation to evaluate the necessity of homeobox genes in delineating regions of heterodont reptilian toothrows. This project will train the Fellow in molecular developmental techniques to complement her experience with functional morphology and paleontology. The Fellow will use this wide range of expertise to educate the public about functional morphology and development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We surveyed the major families of lizards and snakes and found that most reptiles do have subtle differences in size and/or shape in their teeth across the jaw, and it's actually quite rare to find species where the teeth are the same throughout.

We found that in species like the agama lizard which fuse their teeth to their jaw and never replace them, new teeth are added to the back of the jaw as the animal grows bigger. A larger animal will grow larger teeth, which is why the newer teeth at the back of the jaw in these lizards are bigger than the older teeth at the front of the jaw. In species that do replace their teeth throughout their lives, such as monitor lizards, this size difference is not seen because newer, larger teeth are continuously being added. One thing that was similar between species was that the teeth on the two bones of the upper jaw were always found to be distinct regions from one another. This implies that something about developing on different bones causes a difference in tooth size/shape.</p>\n<p>Previous evidence has shown that there is some association between the way that the jaw bones, the teeth, and the nerves in the jaw develop when the animal is still an embryo. We have used CT scans of modern and fossil reptiles, mammals, and mammalian ancestors to further understand this association and how it evolved over time. We found that the early ancestors of mammals started to have a distinct canine-like region of their teeth. At the next stage of evolution, the canine tooth enlarged and seems to have caused the nerves in the jaw to branch around the root of this large tooth. Reptiles do not show this branching, so the tooth regions in a reptile may not be related to nerve branching.</p>\n<p>We are also using modern gecko embryos to further explore how tooth regions develop on reptiles. We have confocal microscope images of gecko embryos that highlight the regions where genes for tooth, jaw, and nerve development were being turned on during development. This data will continue to be analyzed and hopefully shed light on whether or not reptiles follow a similar pattern of tooth and jaw embryonic development as what we see in mammals.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/26/2024<br>\nModified by: Savannah&nbsp;L&nbsp;Olroyd</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109588/2109588_10838795_1722014545584_Varanus_breakpoints--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109588/2109588_10838795_1722014545584_Varanus_breakpoints--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Monitor lizard modeled regions\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109588/2109588_10838795_1722014545584_Varanus_breakpoints--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Monitor lizard modeled regions\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Results from analysis of monitor lizard showing where int he tooth row the changes in tooth shape occur.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Savannah Olroyd</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Savannah&nbsp;L&nbsp;Olroyd\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Monitor lizard modeled regions</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109588/2109588_10838795_1722014301130_Agama_agama00--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109588/2109588_10838795_1722014301130_Agama_agama00--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Agama lizard jaw scan\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109588/2109588_10838795_1722014301130_Agama_agama00--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Agama lizard jaw scan\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CT scans of young (left) and old (right) agama lizards, illustrating the addition of larger teeth at the back of the jaw in larger animals.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Savannah Olroyd</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Savannah&nbsp;L&nbsp;Olroyd\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Agama lizard jaw scan</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109588/2109588_10838795_1722014472087_Agama_agama_breakpoints--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109588/2109588_10838795_1722014472087_Agama_agama_breakpoints--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Agama modeled regions\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109588/2109588_10838795_1722014472087_Agama_agama_breakpoints--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Agama modeled regions\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Results from analysis showing where in the tooth row the changes in tooth shape occur</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Savannah Olroyd</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Savannah&nbsp;L&nbsp;Olroyd\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Agama modeled regions</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109588/2109588_10838795_1722014374683_Varanus_lateral--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109588/2109588_10838795_1722014374683_Varanus_lateral--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Monitor lizard jaw scan\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2109588/2109588_10838795_1722014374683_Varanus_lateral--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Monitor lizard jaw scan\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CT scan of a monitor lizard showing differences in tooth size and shape along the jaw.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Savannah Olroyd</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Savannah&nbsp;L&nbsp;Olroyd\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Monitor lizard jaw scan</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
