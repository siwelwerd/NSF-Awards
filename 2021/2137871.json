DRange is envisioned as a comprehensive learning process that interweaves facilitated discussions, collaborative games, and group activities, supported by a flexible and adaptable technical platform that uses simulated (or de-toxed) disinformation to both encourage critical conversations about online risks and vulnerabilities, and cultivate user resilience. DRange will be designed, developed and structured in collaboration with community partners to foster group interactions in diverse settings (e.g., classrooms, after school activities, public libraries, summer camps, senior and community centers, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
