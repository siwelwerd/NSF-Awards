 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). \r\n\r\nThe microbiome, communities of microbes that live on and within animals including humans, contributes to important host bodily functions and can be negatively impacted by disturbances in a host\u2019s environment. In this dissertation research project, the investigator examines how anthropogenic disturbance alters the hair, oral, and gut microbiomes of three primate species living in the same region. The comparative nature of this research advances understanding about how host species-specific factors and body region-specific factors relate to microbiome diversity in the face of external disturbances. The project supports student training in STEM and public science outreach activities, and can inform primate conservation efforts for endangered species living in threatened areas. \r\n\r\nRecent studies have shown that the vertebrate microbiome is modified by ecological conditions, and that reduced microbiome diversity is associated with host health issues. However, despite the compelling relationships between host health, environmental disturbance, and the microbiome, comparative primate studies including microbial communities throughout the host body are lacking due to the challenges of sampling wild primates. This project examines the relationship between microbiome diversity and landscape disturbance, hair cortisol concentration, body region, and host species. The researcher collects hair, oral, and gut microbiome samples as well as hair cortisol samples from three wild primate species in the same region. Diversity of microbiome samples is analyzed by sequencing the 16S rRNA bacterial gene, a highly conserved gene found in most bacteria and archaea that can be used to identify the taxa present within the microbial communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project looks at how the communities of microbes found in the hair, mouths, and guts of lemurs are different between lemurs living in the wild and lemurs living in captivity. Additionally, this research explores if lemur species that are more closely related to each other have similar communities of microbes even if they live in completely different environments, or if lemurs living in the same area have similar microbial communities regardless of how distantly related they are. I found that lemur microbiomes varied significantly across host environments, host species identity, and body region. Host species identity appeared to explain most of the variation in microbiome composition across lemurs, followed by body region and host environment. This meant that lemurs in the same genus had similar microbiomes, even across different environments. Surprisingly, lemurs living in both low and high disturbance areas in the wild had less diverse microbiomes than captive lemurs, adding to the growing body of evidence that microbiome diversity may not be a consistent indicator of microbiome health: instead, microbiome composition and differential abundance of microbes across samples may reveal more about meaningful shifts in the microbiome. I also found that wild lemur microbiomes varied more in composition than captive lemur microbiomes, which were all similar and less variable even across different captive institutions. This suggests that captivity has a Westernizing and homogenizing effect on the microbiome. This effect was more strongly observed in the gut and hair microbiome than the oral microbiome. Based on the results of this study, the oral microbiome appears to be a conserved and highly filtered microbial community. Conversely, the hair microbiome is most subject to external effects and can serve as an indicator of the environmental microbes to which the host is exposed. The effect of host environment on the microbiome was also more strongly observed in folivorous lemurs (<em>Propithecus</em> spp.) compared to the other generalist and frugivorous lemurs in the study, which aligns with previous research which found that folivore microbiomes are more strongly affected by captivity and habitat disturbance. This project is the most comprehensive comparative full-body analysis of the lemur microbiome to date, and can inform conservation and captive management strategies to maximize functionally healthy microbiomes in endangered primates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/19/2023<br>\nModified by: Rachel&nbsp;B&nbsp;Burten</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2120509/2120509_10757380_1702968155218_Picture1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2120509/2120509_10757380_1702968155218_Picture1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Sampling Regime of Study\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2120509/2120509_10757380_1702968155218_Picture1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Sampling Regime of Study\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A wild sifaka overlaid with the five different body regions sampled for the purposes of this study.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rachel Bell Burten</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rachel&nbsp;B&nbsp;Burten\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Sampling Regime of Study</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
