 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harmonic Analysis is the branch of mathematics concerned with the rigorous description of signals (functions) and of their processing (operators). Examples of signals are sound, images, time series and weather data. Such signals are analyzed via the overlaying (superposition) of basic harmonics of well-specified duration, intensity and frequency. These basic harmonics are functions called wavelets. Image or audio denoising, compression, or pattern recognition are accomplished by filter processing, which refers to a suitable superposition of each wavelet after the action of the filter on it. This is also known as the time-frequency method. A particular concrete example of a re-construction process is used in tomographic imaging, where the shape of a solid body is re-composed from samples of the body along one or two-dimensional rays of penetrating waves, which can be mathematically described as lines or planes in three dimensional space. One component of this mathematics research project focuses on a new family of methods for the wavelet description of the class of singular integral operators, arising for instance in the time-frequency analysis of highly oscillatory signals. Another component of this research project is concerned with the mathematical properties of sampling solid objects along lines or planes. The integrated broader impact activities focus on strengthening the pool of socioeconomically disadvantaged, ethnical minority students (underrepresented groups) in graduate degrees in mathematics and improving retention. Activities connected to training and mentoring of graduate students in Analysis and topical dissemination of knowledge will also be carried out. \r\n \r\nThe broad aim of the first circle of questions is to produce representation formulas for classes of singular integrals in terms of so-called model operators conserving the same invariance structure. This paradigm applies to Zygmund-type operators and modulation invariant operators akin to the bilinear Hilbert transform, both of which are out of reach for dyadic-probabilistic methods. Concrete applications come from elliptic and dispersive PDE, operator theory and quasi-conformal mappings. The second related family of questions is motivated by pointwise convergence of bilinear ergodic averages for Banach-valued functions, a celebrated theorem by Bourgain in the scalar case. The approach is based on Banach-valued variational estimates for the truncated bilinear Hilbert transform. The central item in a further set of questions concerning directional singular integrals is a version of the Kakeya maximal estimate where tubular averages are replaced with averages over singular line segments, and more generally, n-dimensional subspaces. One source of motivation is the connection with Fourier restriction in higher codimensions. The methods involve algebra-geometric techniques such as polynomial partitioning on manifolds.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
