 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The proposed project develops a personalized tutoring tool using artificial intelligence, teaching the skill to translate word problems into mathematical expressions. This system will identify areas of weaknesses in interpretation of word problems, then create associated drills. This can be used at various educational stages to help recruit and retain students in STEM disciplines.  \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops an artificial intelligence tool to assess student understanding of word problems and develop associated tools for student drills. The initial application will be supplementary materials for undergraduate thermodynamics courses, but the process is applicable to STEM education at all levels.  The system has a testing capability to gather data on student performance and develop a customized response.  This system will advance techniques for self-paced supplementary education to increase STEM student retention.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
