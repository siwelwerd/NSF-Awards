 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nResearchers play a critical role in the production of new ideas, yet relatively little is known about how the composition of researchers affects research output.  This project will address this question directly and explicitly tie the evolution of ideas to demographic shifts in the representation of historically underrepresented minority (URM) groups and women in economics.  As such, it connects closely with efforts to broaden participation toward greater inclusion of historically marginalized groups at universities, colleges, and professional organizations  across the nation.\r\n\r\nThis project will link the most comprehensive data sets on the supply of, and demand for, Ph.D. economists by year and field within economics.  This unprecedented coverage will enable researchers to track the evolution of ideas and innovation in economics and the role that labor supply and demand factors have played in that process.  Close examination of these data will lead to a better understanding of the relationship between the demographic composition of researchers and ideas, with a focus on estimating the impact of increasing diversity on the depth and breadth of research innovation and ideas. This project will also yield insights from the variation in the representation of women and URM groups across fields over time to provide actionable evidence on increasing diversity more broadly in the profession.  Finally, this Mid-Career Advancement (MCA) project will support moving the PI\u2019s area of expertise into the field of innovation while opening new avenues of inquiry into the link between diversity and innovation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This Mid-Career Advancement project analyzes the impact of labor supply and demand factors on ideas and innovation to assess how the demographic composition of researchers affects research output.\r\n\n\nAnalysis of demand data shows substantial variation in demand over time and significant variation in demand across fields within economics. On the supply side, author demographics were linked with economic research fields using dissertation research topics and large-scale algorithmic methods that identify author demographics based on names.\r\n\n\nResults show how racial and ethnic backgrounds, as well as gender of dissertation authors, relate to fields of economic research. One important finding is that women appear to bring gender-related research topics into a wide range of fields within economics. It is also noteworthy that, despite stagnation in the share of women among economics Ph.D.s in recent years, there has been a remarkable rise in gender-related dissertations in many fields within economics. By linking the evolution of ideas to changes in the representation of historically underrepresented minority groups and women in economics, this project connects closely with efforts to broaden participation and inclusion of historically marginalized groups at universities, colleges, and professional organizations across the nation.\r\n\n\nThis projectalso conducts a long-term evaluation of one of the longest running professional mentoring programs aimed at underrepresented groups in economics, which matches economics Ph.D. students and new doctorates from underrepresented groups with professional economists who serve as mentors in the field.
