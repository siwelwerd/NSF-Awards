 "awd_abstract_narration": "This awards supports research in gravitational physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Many of the deepest problems in theoretical physics revolve around combining Einstein's theory of general relativity with quantum theory. The resulting theory is called \"quantum gravity\" and is needed to better understand the origin of the universe, the nature of space and time on small scales, and what happens inside black holes. The research supported by this grant will use the latest techniques and tools to try to answer some of these fundamental problems. An essential part of the work is the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the knowledge and techniques that are central to understanding and discovery in gravitational physics. Through a range of forums from public lectures, to informing media reporters, the Principal Investigators will disseminate the directions and results of their research to a broad audience. Society at large will benefit by increasing their understanding of science and the world they live in.\r\n\r\nThe research involves three inter-related programs of research. The first works to understand what sort of spacetimes are needed to describe gravity at the quantum level, taking into account the quantum fluctuations that may range far beyond familiar classical solutions. In particular, the light-cone structure of such spacetimes may be far from classical, and may even be singular. We will investigate the implications of such effects for distant observers, focusing on properties called unitarity and boundary causality. And while it is now understood to be consistent to include fluctuations that cause the spacetime to change topology, the investigators will study whether fluctuations at this level are in fact required by fundamental principles. A second part of the project further investigates the physical consequences of fluctuating topology and the associated processes by which a large universe may interact with a physically-separate closed universe (often called a baby universe). It was shown recently that this at least partially resolves the nearly 50-year-old black hole information problem, but the actual physics experienced by an observer inside an old evaporating black hole remains to be fully understood. The project will also study associated implications for the above-mentioned closed universes, and thus for cosmology and for our universe as a whole. The final part probes the 50-year-old cosmic censorship hypothesis and the structure of singularities in classical gravity. Known violations of certain versions of cosmic censorship with AdS boundary conditions will be analyzed in more detail with an eye toward 1) connections to the so-called weak gravity conjecture of high energy physics and 2) developing possible further counter-examples in asymptotically flat spacetimes. The fact that certain black hole singularities show strong sensitivity to parameters will also be explored. The methods employed in all three programs of research will be primarily analytic, though these will be supplemented with numerical calculations on desktop computers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIntellectual Merit: This project addressed fundamental questions concerning Einstein's theory of General Relativity and, in particular, its interactions with quantum mechanics.\n\n\nOne avenue of research involved the gravitational path integral. In general, path integrals are tools for computing quantum effects. For example, the results of the famous double-slit experiment can be predicted by the idea that the particles travel over all possible paths, and that each path contributes with a certain phase. The gravitational path integral is then an analogue in which one sums over all gravitational fields which, in General Relativity, means that one sums over all spacetime geometries.\n\n\nThe idea of the gravitational path integral had previously been used to compute the entropy of black holes and to compute how the evaporation of black holes through the emission of Hawking radiation returns information to the outside universe. But the rules used to study such path integrals were somewhat ad hoc, and had not been shown to follow from fundamental principles. This project took significant steps to fill this gap and, in fact, has now outlined a research program to give a complete derivation in the limit of small Newton constant G (which is the regime in which we currently understand quantum effects in gravity).\n\n\nAnother avenue of research explored charged and rotating black holes that are \"extreme\" in the sense that they carry the maximal possible charge and rotation for a given mass. Since the 1960's, solutions to General Relativity have been known describing such black holes and showing that they are very much like nonextreme ones.

Two of the three PhD students who have completed their studies are now postdocs in theoretical physics at MIT and Harvard. The other is starting a postdoc in quantum information theory in Paris. Two of the 9 PhD students are female, which is nearly twice the 11.5\\% rate of recent female PhDs in theoretical physics reported in data from the American Physical Society.  The other 6 PhD students will complete their studies in the next few years. One of the postdocs is now an Associate Professor at the Raman Research Institute, while the other will complete his UCSB postdoc in 2026.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/05/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DonaldMarolf\n"
