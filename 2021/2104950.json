 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nThis award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Denielle Perry at Northern Arizona University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the contested nature of Indigenous peoples and hydropower development as they converge through the context of climate discourse. This study is imperative given the dominant role hydropower now plays as a global climate mitigation strategy and the cascading social-ecological impacts that hydropower projects have on Indigenous peoples, their lands, and cultures. This project aims to contribute a more nuanced understanding of this Indigenous-hydropower nexus and more broadly, offer a more complete perspective of decision-making processes within multi-scaler climate governance.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this postdoctoral research project engages scholarship on imaginaries, space/place, and hydrosocial territories to answer the following question: What are the dynamic interactions and feedbacks between Indigenous imaginaries, climate change discourse, and hydropower development? To address this question, the project employs mixed-methods, ethnographic research at climate and hydropower conferences, as well as in the Western United States where proposed hydropower projects threaten Indigenous communities. Methods for data collection include interviews, focus groups, participant observation, and policy research. The results of this study will be used to directly inform practical suggestions for policy changes to develop more equitable climate mitigation strategies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Through ongoing discussions and planning with the American Anthropological Association (AAA) executive board, I created the Climate Change Interest Group and a working subgroup focused on the role of anthropologists at UNFCCC COP meetings (the annual meetings that determine global climate policy strategies for adaptation and mitigation).
