 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description:\r\nCharacterization of electrical properties of materials in nanometer scale dimensions has become crucial in a broad range of fundamental and applied research fields ranging from chemistry to physics to quantum computation. In particular, the electrostatic potential profile and electric charge distribution is of fundamental importance in nanoscale electronic devices including quantum devices. This project develops a novel scanning probe microscope for pioneering extremely sensitive measurements of electric potential/charge with sub-nanometer spatial resolution. The developed instrument will be used to study a wide range of advanced materials and novel devices. Graduate and undergraduate students participate in the science of precision instrumentation development and research. The status of Texas State University as a Hispanic Serving Institution increases the likelihood of participation of underrepresented minorities in the research activities.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant supports the development of a scanning single-electron box electrometer microscope, which is based on an atomic force microscope and an integrated single-electron box with its probe tip that serves as a sensitive charge sensor. It enables detection of extremely small quantities of electric charge and electric potential and provides the spatial map of electric potential/charge with sub-nanometer spatial resolution. The outcome of the project will be a cryogenic atomic force microscope with an extremely high electric charge/potential sensitivity. The instrument is designed to operate with samples at temperature as low as 20 mK and in magnetic fields up to 9 T in a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator. It will be used to investigate the charge state of individual quantum dots for quantum computers and novel electronic states in two-dimensional materials/electronic systems, topological insulators, and superconductors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
