 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support International Research Collaboratives (IRCs), which are groups of law and science researchers organized to undertake various sociolegal research projects. As well, the project will support the Junior Scholars Workshop (JSW), which will to train and mentor the next generation of sociolegal scholars. The project will connect and engage an interdisciplinary group of scholars and researchers with current and cutting-edge theoretical, methodological, and policy approaches, thus enhancing law and science scholarship. \r\n\r\nThis project will support the cross-disciplinary research endeavors of the IRCs by providing support for scholars to participate in them at the 2022 annual conference of the Law and Society Association. The research activities of the IRCs will build upon the many research collaborations that have produced important scientific discoveries by advancing knowledge and understanding in the several interdisciplinary and disciplinary-specific fields of sociolegal studies. As well, the project will bring together entry-level scholars at the JSW, which will serve to guide, prepare, and mentor the next generation of sociolegal researchers, further developing and advancing law and science scholars and scholarship. In doing so, the project will link a new cohort of scholars with more established researchers, thus providing networking and collaborative opportunities while fostering the future of the sociolegal field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
