 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. This two-year Pilots and Feasibility project seeks to build knowledge and strategic impact in the informal STEM learning field by studying how and why science-education-art collaborations yield impactful informal STEM learning experiences. By design and implementing interactive and participatory experiences for adult audiences, this project will build knowledge about how to help communities learn about environmental science and apply scientific knowledge to environmental decision-making in their lives. \r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s two overarching research questions are: (1) What are the essential elements of collaboration among scientists, educators, and artists that support learning about adaptation in a changing environment? (2) In what ways do designed, participatory, informal science learning experiences support participant learning? This pilot project will: a) develop methods for facilitating and assessing collaboration among scientists, educators, and artists; b) pilot and refine approaches for engaging scientists, educators, and artists with community members for high quality participatory experiences focus on learning about adaptation to environmental change in informal learning settings; c) pilot and refine methods to measure the outcomes for community participants on knowledge about environmental change and its application to problems in their everyday lives.  This project is innovative in bridging a diverse body of scholarship in order to study the process of collaboration and the specific ways interdisciplinary collaborations foster learning. Because informal STEM learning settings often combine the work of multiple disciplines, examining the process and outcomes of collaborative, participatory STEM learning has the potential to deliver widely applicable guidance for achieving more impactful educational outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will broaden participation by engaging adult members of environmentally vulnerable communities in participatory STEM activities and will improving individual and community well-being by delivering tools for future decision-making.  The collaborative project will build valuable partnerships and capacity between disparate sectors of society, allowing co-learning and co-production of knowledge. Results will be published in scholarly journals as well as shared with community participants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project team convened a collaborative \"A-S-E team\" of artists, scientists, and educators each of the two years of the project (2021 and 2022), for two total iterations of the work. In both project years, the A-S-E team worked collaboratively together to plan engagement with a group of adult New Orleans residents to co-learn about climate science and flooding and work with residents to create an original theater piece about climate science and their collective experiences of climate change impacts in New Orleans. Each year, the project research team carried out qualitative interviews with all six members of the A-S-E team, before and after that year&rsquo;s project work, concerned the collaboration process and interdisciplinary collaboration. The external evaluator carried out surveys and interviews with the A-S-E teams both project years. The project team also recruited a group of adult New Orleans residents as participant learners each of the two project years: in year 1, adult residents of the Gentilly neighborhood in New Orleans, a neighborhood very close to the Dillard University campus and which experiences severe flooding on a regular basis. In year 2, the team recruited adult residents of the New Orleans East neighborhood. Each project year the participant learners worked with the A-S-E team to learn about climate science, flooding, geology, and other science concepts relevant to their lived experience, and discussed the learners&rsquo; lived experiences of tropical cyclones, flooding, and other impacts of climate change.
