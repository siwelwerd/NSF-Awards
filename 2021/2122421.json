 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation \u2013 Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project is to develop and refine the technology for an advanced sensor platform in the form of wearable or remote, zero-power sensors that save the lives of and avoid harm to firefighters, military personnel, and members of hazardous materials management (HAZMAT) teams. Exposure to harmful chemicals in the air that firefighters and other first responders breathe is a concern. The focus of the proposed activities is to advance technology development of optical text, image and dose \u00d7 time sensors that detect toxic gases and vapors in the environment as well as monitor inhaled or exhaled vapors in disease treatment or disease progression. In addition to chlorine, phosgene, hydrazine, and aliphatic amines, the intrinsic capabilities of this sensor platform are expanded to metallic mercury, hydrogen cyanide, and oxides of nitrogen, all posing significant health risks and imminent danger to the professionals in the target markets. Furthermore, extended in-depth business and entrepreneurial training in collaboration with industrial partners will support market entry, strengthen commercialization efforts, create jobs, and facilitate an increasing economic footprint for toxic gas sensors. \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on toxic gas and vapor sensors. This project describes the development of a chemical sensor platform technology that uses precisely engineered chemical functionalization of and chemical reactions at patterned nanoparticle surfaces controlling the alignment of nematic liquid crystals. Combined with the implementation of gas permeable, size-selective polymer gaskets, the proposed technology advances to a sensor platform for the simultaneous quantitative and qualitative detection of multiple toxic gases and vapors at parts per million and parts per trillion levels. In cooperation with industry partners, this technology development includes analytical testing of sensitivity and selectivity of as-prepared sensor prototypes as well as analysis of pain points, limitations of existing technologies, market potential, and key approaches to market introduction. Key technological hurdles further the development of a minimum viable sensor product that shortens of the response time and enhances the sensitivity and selectivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
