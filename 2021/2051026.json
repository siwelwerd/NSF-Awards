 "awd_abstract_narration": "Each summer, this REU program in mathematics at Baruch College, CUNY will provide the opportunity for a diverse group of students from across the country to gain hands-on exposure to mathematical research and mentorship. One main goal of the REU is to contribute to the development of a diverse and inclusive future workforce. Each summer, at least half of participants will be women. The program will also prioritize students who might otherwise have no opportunity to explore their mathematical potential. Under the guidance of faculty mentors, according to their individual backgrounds, participants work on a wide range of complex mathematical research projects, investigate open mathematical problems, and hone their writing and presentation skills. The mentors aim to foster long-term relationships with their mentees, supporting them as they continue with their careers.\r\n\r\nThe research projects of the program study open questions in combinatorics, discrete probability, and mathematical aspects of computer science. These include projects in discrete geometry, combinatorial topology, probabilistic approaches to particle systems, combinatorial aspects of theoretical computer science, additive combinatorics, and graph theory. Many of the projects focus on less-explored aspects of active research topics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
