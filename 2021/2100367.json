 "awd_abstract_narration": "Models of physical phenomena are often formulated as dynamical systems, rules that specify how quantities evolve in time. There are many different types of dynamical systems, and one important mathematical question is to classify the statistical or qualitative behavior of these systems. This project uses descriptive set theory to show what kinds of classification are possible and to establish the mathematical limitations of general classifications. The project involves graduate students.\r\n\r\nClassification of dynamical systems can be approached by classifying the statistical and qualitative behavior of diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds and establishing criteria for deciding when time forwards is isomorphic to time backwards (in the appropriate category).  These questions are closely related to which abstract measure-preserving transformations are isomorphic to volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds.  This project studies when classifications are possible with inherently countable methods and explores methods for realizing abstract transformations as diffeomorphisms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nDuring the period 08/01/2024-:10/31/2024\r\n\n\nForeman investigated problems in two areas related to the foundation of mathematics.\r\n\n\nOne is about impossibility results in mathematics (Type 4 impossibility results)\r\n\n\n1.) Foreman formulated a specific notion of Type 4 impossibility resultsto mean that that problems are not solvable using inherently countable information. This broad definition gives a version of Churchs thesis for Borel subsets of Polish spaces.\r\n\n\n2.) Foreman continued his investigations related to Borel reducibility between problems in mathematics. This included further work on reductions between ergodic measure preserving transformations in the same orbit classes. With Weiss he showed that there is a constructive (Borel) proof of Dyes theorem and that the Orbit classes of ergodic transformations have the same generic properties as the ergodic transformations of [0,1]. The construction gives a Borel reduction of the general conjugacy problem to the conjugacy problem for ergodic transformation in the same Full Group. \r\n\n\nThe other is related to precipitous ideals.\r\n\n\nPrecipitous ideals give a generalization of large cardinals that is consistent to hold on smaller cardinals. The work here was in four directions:\r\n\n\n1.) The first was understanding the relationship between the Super-Ineffable ideal (defined in a previous year of the grant) and standard notions of ineffability. With his student Eshkol, Foreman clarified their result showing that the Super-Ineffable Ideal on a cardinal is proper just in case that cardinal is Completely Ineffable.\r\n\n\n2.) With Magidor, Foreman showed that complete ineffability is NOT downwards absolute. This is a bit surprising since earlier results of Abramov, Harrington, Kleinberg and Zwicker showed that complete ineffability is downwards absolute to L.\r\n\n\n3.) With Magidor, Foreman clarified the relationship between the Super-Ineffable ideal and Baumgartners notion of n-ineffability. The properties that the nth level of the construction of the Super-Ineffabile ideal is proper and n-ineffability are intertwined stationarily often.\r\n\n\n4.) Foreman showed that the assumptions in an earlier paper about Welch-Games, which were apparently much weaker (a weakly compact cardinal) were, in fact, as strong as complete ineffability.\r\n\n\nThe properties 1-4) have been written into a joint paper with Eshkol and Magidor and submitted to a journal.\r\n\n\nDissemination of Results\r\n\n\nIn addition to the paper mentioned, and the preliminary write up of the work on impossibility results, Foreman gave invited talks at 3 locations during the period of this grant. \r\n\n\n(*) The first were both a seminar talk and a colloquium at the University of Notre Dame. \r\n\n\n(*) The second was an invited 45 minute talk at the Western Sectional Meeting of the AMS.\r\n\n\n(*) The third was an invited 50 minute talk at the Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Meeting at Rutgers, November 1-3. \r\n\n\nBroader Inpact\r\n\n\nForeman continued his interactions with the educational activites of EDGE, and facilitated the reimbursement and salary for one of their lecturers.\r\n\n\nForeman also held seminars and hosted visitors at UC Irvine.
