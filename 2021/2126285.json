 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Extended Small Institution Multiple Organization Regional OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (ESI-MORe-OFFN) connects two under-resourced campuses, Oklahoma City University and Fires Innovation Science and Technology Accelerator campus of Cameron University, to the OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (OFFN) in support of research and education drivers in the areas of engineering and economics. The project extends existing and creates new and diverse research collaboration opportunities for faculty and students through fostering broader and deeper collaborations and expanding research and education activities. The project provides cyberinfrastructure resources to these two under-resourced campuses, reaching a diverse student population, including first-generation students. The project has significant educational impact for both undergraduate and graduate students at the campuses, providing them with additional STEM and cyberinfrastructure opportunities as well as exposure to leading researchers and CI practitioners.\r\n\r\nThe ESI-MORe-OFFN project extends the OneOklahoma Friction Free Network to two under-resourced campuses by implementing Science DMZs, Data Transfer Nodes and network performance monitoring capabilities in support of science application drivers at the two campuses and integrating these capabilities with other similar capabilities across Oklahoma.\u2020In addition, the project enhances the skills and abilities of technical personnel at each campus and facilitates cross-campus collaborations, including shared uses of computing tools, scientific equipment, and educational materials by engaging faculty and students in the larger OneOklahoma CyberInfrastructure Initiative (OneOCII). OFFN is managed by OneNet, Oklahoma's research and education network, and scientific leadership is provided by the University of Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
