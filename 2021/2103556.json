 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RAPID award supports the real-time study of the impacts of COVID-19 on housing insecurity and off-site residential modular construction design in rural Alaska. Preliminary research conducted by the PI team demonstrates that COVID-19 has already changed how builders and architects work with rural Alaska communities to design, construct and install off-site modular construction projects. The PIs propose to document and analyze how new models of virtual consultation and collaboration are being deployed, what roles resilience and innovation play in the development of new building practices, and how new building solutions affect family and community structure. This award lays the foundation for subsequent research on how transformations in housing construction intersect with broader concerns over limited rural infrastructure in Alaska.  \r\n\r\nThe PI team will conduct remote interviews and participatory workshops with stakeholders to document the effects of the pandemic on off-site residential modular construction practices. The proposed work draws upon five months of preliminary research and existing partnerships with builders, architects and engineers working on cold climate housing. RAPID funding will enable the PIs to observe the initial stages of project design and development, tracking logistical strategies and solutions employed by builders working with remote rural communities. Initial focus will be on two off-site modular building projects: elder pods in Unalakleet and a women\u2019s shelter in Allakaket. Broader impacts include greater responsiveness of builders to expressed needs of rural and Indigenous residents in cold climates and support for the development of more culturally appropriate and sustainable housing in Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We originally described this as off-site modular construction, but soon learned about or became familiar with a range of prefabricated building systems (for example, manufactured, volumetric modular, system-built, Quonset huts, and reused military buildings). Even among the builders and community stakeholders we worked with, there was very little shared understanding of these terms. Our effort to depict what we called ?the spectrum of modularity? highlighted how several traditional indigenous architectural systems are modular and evolved into a prototypical housing design decision matrix.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;As we worked in Alaska, we prioritized cultivating partnerships with residents and with builders, architects, and engineers engaged in multiple off-site building projects at cold climate housing organizations in Alaska, as well as with housing authorities, policy makers, community advocates for unhoused populations, and academics working on housing security in Alaska. We also designed the research to be responsive to recent requests made by Alaska Native entities that NSF-funded projects focus on infrastructure in rural communities.&nbsp;Adhering to these objectives, our team engaged in activities underway in Alaska as the pandemic complicated responses to the housing crisis, and we helped rapidly develop ways to innovate without in-person or on-the-ground visits.</p>\n<p>First, we developed and implemented a model of Community Research Assistants (CRAs) for collecting locally embedded data in remote communities.&nbsp;CRAs are local residents trained by the research team to help identify and assist with the facilitation of interviews, provide guidance on research questions and protocols, and visually document building practices and issues.&nbsp;The hybrid online/in-person CRA/research team model presented new ways to engage community members in anthropological research and provided an effective and culturally responsible way to conduct research in remote indigenous communities.</p>\n<p>Second, sharing outputs in a range of formats to reach multiple audiences was an important project goal. We experimented with hybrid-online/in-person methods in workshops for design charrettes, critical response practices, and teambuilding, resulting in original participatory image prototypes that can involve community members in design charrettes for ?ideal? arctic entryways and caches.
