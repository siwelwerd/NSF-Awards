 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to serve the national interest by enhancing practices to increase motivation and persistence in mathematics teacher preparation. This Engaged Student Learning Level 1 project, Broadening Engagement in Mathematics Participation and Readiness Education Project (BE-MathPREP), proposes to implement a tiered-mentorship model at the University of Hawai\u2018i West O\u2018ahu (UHWO). The BE-MathPREP mentoring model in the UHWO pre-service math teacher preparation program uses a multilayered structured program in which the lower-division math students are mentored by Peer Academic Leaders (PALs).  PALs include mathematics faculty, in-service mathematics teachers, and peer pre-service mathematics teachers who mentor lower-division mathematics students through this project\u2019s Math Teacher\u2019s Circle at Hawaii (MaTCH) sessions. Two research questions guide project activities: (Q1). How well does BE-MathPREP PAL improve lower-division math students\u2019 math self-efficacy in ways to increase STEM interest? (Q2). How well do BE-MathPREP PAL and MaTCH improve teacher candidates\u2019 teaching and math efficacy in ways to increase student persistence in STEM teaching? Anticipated outcomes of the project include an increase in the number of diverse students pursuing STEM teaching and production of at least 20 dedicated pre-service teachers who become committed and competent professionals. \r\n\r\nThe goal of BE-MathPREP is to determine the effectiveness of evidence-based practices in teaching and learning mathematics, including culturally responsive strategies, and to provide academic support for undergraduates in/to the mathematics teacher preparation program at UHWO. BE-MathPREP starts with selecting student mentors (PALs) with priority given to pre-service teacher candidates.  This is followed by implementing the PAL program and MaTCH sessions during the summer and academic year. One or two PALs assist in each section of foundational math courses. Mentored by the course instructor, PALs are involved both in-and-out of the classroom. PALs build on hard skills throughout the semester, such as understanding and communicating the course material, and soft skills, such as rapport that PALs develop with their faculty mentors. PALs work directly with in-service teachers through MaTCH meetings to develop their first teaching portfolio. In addition, PALs have the opportunity to receive support for organizing place-based summer workshops and undergraduate research. This project contributes to knowledge generation by developing a recruitment and retention model based on peer-mentoring in an indigenous-serving institution. The establishment of the math community of UHWO students and professionals (faculty and in-service teachers) through the BE-MathPREP PAL and MaTCH efforts has the potential to allow all members to stay current in math content, as well as to continue to develop practices that advance math education.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.  The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship (Noyce) Program is providing co-funding for this IUSE: EHR project to support the project's pre-service teacher preparation goals, which are well-aligned with Noyce Program goals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
