 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the acquisition of a Scanning X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer Microprobe (sXPS-u) at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR). The sXPS-u system allows characterization of various materials and provides researchers with the chemical makeup of materials. Such a system is critical for scientific advances in a range of topics such as metallurgy, corrosion, aerospace, nanomaterials, catalysis, mining, automotive, anthropology, geology, electronics and advanced manufacturing, with a special emphasis on energy generation and storage topics such as geothermal, nuclear, solar, and battery technology. The sXPS-u instrument is used to train hundreds of students at various levels to help prepare the next generation engineers, scientists, and inventors. A large number of faculty and scientists from UNR, other academic institutions and national laboratories have access to 20% of the time on the sXPS-u system. Users from industry, ranging from multinational corporations to small businesses and startups in the UNR incubator share 30% of the time through the Materials Characterization Nevada (MCNV), an UNR entity dedicated to providing materials characterization services to industry.  The instrument is used in several courses to enhance education and training at UNR. Specifically, dedicated course modules are being developed to demonstrate the use of sXPS-u in surface analysis to students. Women and underrepresented minorities in science and engineering are particularly targeted to broaden their participation and help develop a diverse workforce for Nevada.\r\n \r\nXPS provides both the chemical speciation (bonding or oxidation state), the molecular bonding information, bandgap and valence band properties. The acquisition of the sXPS-u system greatly benefits  the following core-funded research projects at UNR (50% of total usage): development of new metallic materials for energy efficiency, lightweight vehicles, and next-generation power plants, understanding corrosion of metals in extreme environments, development of advanced batteries, improving electrocatalysis, developing dynamic windows, optimization of reprocessing/management of used nuclear fuel, comprehending electrochemistry of nanostructures, and projects at the nano-water-food-energy nexus. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
