 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific institutions increasingly recognize the need to remove barriers for individuals historically underrepresented in science and to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). A wider breadth of scientific competencies, achieved by improving DEI, is needed to address many critical scientific concerns with global impacts. However, improving DEI requires a significant cultural shift, and scientific societies provide a unique platform to lead these cultural changes in the biological sciences. Scientific societies represent a wide variety of individuals and institutions; they have access to multiple fields of biology to impart resources and education; and they can enable networking and idea sharing across many disciplines and organizations to empower new approaches. The American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS) was founded with the goal of unifying the individuals and organizations that collectively represent the biological sciences, so that the community could address matters that impact life on earth. AIBS brings together 115 member societies and organizations that represent the full spectrum of the life sciences to address matters of collective concern. It is critical that scientific societies create inclusive, diverse, equitable and accepting (IDEA) scientific environments to ensure that science is equipped to address 21st century grand challenges. Creating IDEA scientific environments requires an iterative process of top-down and bottom-up approaches that rely on sharing information and experiences, analyzing personal assumptions and expectations, communicating with honesty and openness, and committing to change. \r\n\r\nThis project will engage and create a collaborative network of majority- and minority-serving biological scientific societies to foster cultural change through two virtual workshops. These workshops will engage scientific society leadership to collaboratively understand the components of IDEA cultures, assess the current culture in biology, identify barriers to enabling IDEA environments, create action plans to overcome these barriers, and commit to long-term cultural change. The first workshop will provide a forum for leaders of scientific societies to engage in shared learning, discussion, and reflection on three topics: (1) culture, (2) bias and stereotypes, and (3) equity. The workshop will offer tools for participants to develop action plans to enable IDEA scientific environments and to take the knowledge, resources, and tools they have gained back to their organizations. A second workshop will occur 6 months later and will be informed by a webinar and a participant survey to assess early implementation of the action plans. The workshop will result in longer-term steps to continue progress in creating IDEA scientific environments. Among the intended project outcomes is a \u201ctool kit,\u201d a repository of tools, templates, resources, and other information that will be available to scientific societies, other institutions, and the public. This tool kit will be curated over time as a place to share information and help cultivate the large-scale changes needed to create IDEA scientific environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It requires changing the culture of science. Culture change is an iterative process of top-down and bottom-up approaches that rely on sharing information and experiences, analyzing assumptions and expectations, communicating with honesty and openness, and committing to change. The American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS), an umbrella organization of 113 biological societies, is committed to changing culture to create IDEA scientific environments. AIBS has convened two conferences that directly engaged scientific society leadership in: working together to understand the components of IDEA cultures, describing the current culture in biology, identifying barriers to enabling IDEA environments, creating action plans to overcome the barriers, and collaborating in mutual commitment to move forward in changing the culture of biology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit.</strong> Scientific societies are in a unique position to foster changes in the culture of biology. They represent a wide variety of individuals and institutions; they have access to multiple fields of biology to impart resources and education; and they can enable networking and idea sharing across diverse disciplines and organizations to empower new approaches. The two AIBS IDEA conferences offered forums for leaders of scientific societies to engage in shared learning, discussion, and reflection about inclusion, diversity, equity, acceptance, individual culture, organizational culture, bias and stereotypes, as well as the internal structure, external communication, and assessment activities of a society.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Project Outcomes</strong>. The first meeting had three major outcomes: (1) identification of characteristics of an IDEA environment, (2) identification of barriers to creating IDEA environments, and (3) strategies to overcome barriers. Characteristics of IDEA environments were defined as inclusivity, diversity, equity, acceptance, communication, respect, accessibility, flexibility, and commitment. Barriers to creating IDEA environments were noted as societies&rsquo; ability to commit to IDEA, lack of incentives for IDEA work, too little acceptance of multiple cultures and perspectives, inadequate knowledge, tools, and resources for creating IDEA environments, insufficient articulation of desired outcomes, and lack of metrics to assess progress. The strategies identified to overcome barriers and create IDEA were to elevate IDEA in core missions and actions of societies; to recognize and value member contributions; to enable better sharing of ideas and resources about IDEA environments; to equip society leadership with knowledge and tools to foster IDEA environments; and to create initiatives to attract, welcome, and support more member diversity. The outcomes from the first meeting clearly identified the relationship between characteristics, barriers, and strategies. As depicted in figure 1, if the suggested strategies are applied, an IDEA scientific environment can be created, thereby overcoming the identified barriers.</p>\n<p>The key outcomes of the second meeting were defining components of each mini-session topic and identifying ways to enhance each topic area to support IDEA, as seen in figures 2&ndash;4. The key outcome of the final meeting was the identification of cross-cutting themes that can serve as a roadmap for societies&rsquo; to commit to IDEA, as is noted in figure 5.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Two summary articles were published in <em>BioScience </em>to share the findings of the conference with the public. The conferences also provided tools for participants to develop action plans based on their discussions about changing organizational culture. Individuals took the knowledge, resources, and tools gained back to their organizations for further work. In addition, a repository of tools, templates, resources, and other information was made available to scientific societies, other institutions, and the public via the AIBS website. This tool kit is a place to share information and help cultivate the changes needed to create IDEA scientific environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact.</strong> Inattention to inclusion, diversity, equity, and acceptance in the biological sciences creates barriers for individuals to join or thrive in successful careers. People who may be gifted scientists are excluded from making contributions based on, for example, gender, gender identity, disability status, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or race. An IDEA scientific community will enable more participation and foster better science. However, changes in the culture of biology (such as functions, practices, policies, institutions, and societies) and among biologists (beliefs, assumptions, expectations, behaviors, and similar personal characteristics) are needed to create an IDEA scientific environment. The IDEA conferences identified and addressed barriers that are holding people back from participating in scientific endeavors, doing their best work, and/or achieving their highest professional potential. The impact of breaking down these barriers and changing culture to create IDEA scientific environments can bring the talent into science that is needed to solve overarching problems facing nature and human existence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/29/2023<br>\nModified by: Dajoie&nbsp;C&nbsp;Baker</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div
