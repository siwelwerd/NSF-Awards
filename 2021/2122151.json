 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). \r\n\r\nHoward University is a private, federally chartered historically Black University in Washington, DC with more than 10,000 students pursuing 120 areas of study; and currently classified as a High Research Activity Institution.  Materials science and engineering (MSE) related research at Howard focuses primarily on quantum materials, optics and photonics and quantum technologies (computing, communications, and sensing). The research focus of this Partnership for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) with Columbia University Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) is on interaction of light with matter for new optical and electrical devices for the quantum information age. This collaboration, namely Partnership for Research and Education in Superatomic and 2D Materials (PRES2M), is to establish the framework needed to pursue new PREM-Pathway for faculty and students at Howard University in MSE. In particular, the following is envisioned: an integrated research and education program that increases participation of undergraduate students in MSE-related research mentored by graduate student trainees and teacher-scholar postdoctoral associates in MSE to strengthen existing diversity efforts at Columbia and provide a foundation for the MSE degree-granting program at Howard. The PREM pathway focuses on matriculation of undergraduate students in MSE-related disciplines to allow for significant growth in the total number of Black students that attain degrees.  Furthermore, the collaboration between Howard and Columbia University MRSEC is aimed at impacting current diversity efforts at Columbia with respect to K-12 outreach, undergraduate student research opportunities, and graduate student admissions.\r\n\r\nThe primary research goal of PRES2M is a better understanding of the quantum phenomena within functional materials, such as, 2D materials and superatomic molecules through a cyclic interplay between materials synthesis, processing, analysis, and theory. The research is aimed at altering material properties to manipulate light-matter interaction including new experimental techniques for thermal tunablity of ultra-strong coupling in 2D nanopatterned films and plasmon-enhanced conductance. This research builds on the materials science of 2D and superatomic materials and applications of quantum phenomena, currently pursued at the Columbia University MRSEC. The goal of this partnership is to fundamentally impact condensed matter physics and materials science and engineering. Through the MRSEC, Howard faculty and students have access to infrastructure, new materials, and expertise in quantum materials research. With the PRES2M, there is an expanded collaboration between both institutions and additional opportunities for co-mentorship of students and postdoctoral associates, joint projects and publications as well as student/faculty exchanges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
