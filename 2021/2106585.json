 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research work aims at providing a better fundamental understanding of the interaction of matter or the quantum vacuum with laser pulses or other strong external fields. The work focuses on new phenomena that are predicted to occur if laser fields are sufficiently intense to trigger the creation of electron-positron pairs. The interdisciplinary character of the new era of laser-controlled matter creation processes to which the work will contribute could provide new connections between atomic, plasma and laser physics. Due to the fundamental nature of the processes examined in these projects, progress could also accelerate advancements in other areas. For example, a better understanding of the electron-positron dynamics could benefit the related development of bright light sources, providing new ways to control atomic, chemical and biological processes on very short time scales. An important mission for the program is also to give undergraduate students the opportunity to gain personal research experience and provide them with important skills, including working as a team and gaining the endurance and intellectual flexibility to tackle serious research problems. \r\n\r\nThe understanding of the relativistic quantum dynamics will be advanced primarily with the aid of computer simulations to allow for spatial and temporal resolution that has been developed by the PIs to solve the quantum field theoretical Dirac equation.  It will also be supported by modern machine learning techniques, such as symbolic regression based on evolutionary algorithms as well as on neural networks.  The goal is to develop novel theoretical approaches that can lead to a first insight into the internal dynamics inside the laser field with complete spatial resolution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
