 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from creating a unique identification system using artificial intelligence (AI)-based facial recognition for horses and other animals that require vaccinations for birth control and disease inoculation.  Wild horses and other wildlife that require remote vaccinations need to be identified so that populations are not over/under vaccinated.  The means to vaccinate either manually or using remote technology exists, but most current methods are expensive, inhumane, or inefficient and identification is limited to photographs, sketches, memory, or RFID microchips.  Federal agencies currently spend well over one hundred million dollars to deal with the problem.  The commercial opportunity for a facial recognition system along with remote vaccination in this country and abroad is substantial.  Wildlife managers will be able to relieve unhealthy overcrowding and allow livestock and domestic animals to co-exist with other species. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will remotely and autonomously control the explosion of the wild horse populations on the open range.  There are approximately 90,000 wild horses on the open range, which is 60,000 over the allowed maximum level.  This is the level which is safe for horses and other animals which share the land.  The need to vaccinate horses with contraceptive birth control is necessary to control the population.  This project will develop an artificial intelligence (AI) identification system for horses using facial recognition technology and couple this with remote automated vaccination at feeding stations to ensure wild horses are correctly vaccinated for birth control and inoculated against disease.  A comprehensive identification system based on facial recognition has commercial and societal impact beyond vaccinations for wild horses, extending to other wild species such as deer, and also to livestock.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The United States has a growing population of wild/feral horses.  Horses have been in North America since Spain introduced them in the early 1600s AD.  Once free they thrived with very few natural enemies.  While some human groups did consume horses for food, many did not.  In the United States it is not culturally acceptable to consume horses.   In 1971 the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act was made into law due to public outcry over the roundups of feral/wild horses on public lands for slaughter.  This law provides for the necessary management, protection, and control of wild horses/burros on public lands.  In 2006, the Horse Slaughter Prevention Act was passed in the US House of Representatives, not allowing funds to go to federal or commercial funding for inspections to continue. \nFederal Agencies tasked with the management of these horses designated Herd Management Areas, HMAs, and determine the healthy population of horses along with other wild and domestic livestock which share that grazing land.  In general, the goal of the population of wild/feral horses in these HMAs is 200% or higher than is healthy. \nToday the most common methods of controlling the wild/feral horse populations are roundups and contraceptives.  Federal agencies tasked with the management of these wild/feral horses conduct roundups or traps, consisting of helicopters and many contractors to gather the required number of horses.  Often these roundups are cruel, resulting in foals being separated from their mothers, broken legs, and other injuries resulting in euthanasia.  The horses are kept in corrals in the hope of adoption. Traps work well for a time until the horses learn to avoid it after watching other horses get caught.  Contraceptives such as Porcine Zona Pellicida (PZP) and GonaCon EQ are either employed on horses that have been captured in roundups or delivered on foot with single-shot rifles from a proximity of 40 yards or less.\nThe cost of the capture method, roundups/traps, is expensive and initially costs from $1,000 to $3,000 per horse.  Most of these horses are not adopted which results in keeping them until they die naturally, which could cost one billion dollars over the life span of these horses.  Currently, there are over 50,000 horses in captivity, costing US Taxpayers over fifty million dollars a year.   The practicality of delivering contraceptive vaccines to over 60,000 mares on foot from rifles to has proven to be ineffective.  \nWhile contraceptives are effective, you must identify which animals have been vaccinated so the populations are not over/under-vaccinated.  The most common methods are memory, sketches, photographs, or RFID microchips.  The first three methods are prone to human mistakes. RFID microchips require that the animal be rounded up to read the microchips, which is not practical, and is expensive and inhumane.  (The microchips are inserted into the neck area of the horse, nuchal ligament, making it difficult to read the chip since the read distance is inches with a proper device.)\nWildlife Protection Management, WPM, has created a platform to deliver identifying microchips and contraceptive vaccines to wild/feral horses using remote technology.  Bait (feed) is used to lure the horses into a position that allows an RFID dart delivery box to send and implant a microchip in the left triceps muscle that can be read again.  A temperature-controlled vaccine box can deliver vaccines to the right triceps muscle.  Cameras are employed to determine gender and correct locations for horses.  The system compiles RFID data and records are kept on vaccinated/unvaccinated horses.  All are solar powered using satellite communications.\nThe problem is the Bureau of Land Management, which is tasked with the most horses, does not like the triceps muscle for RFID since it is not an acceptable location for domestic animals that could be slaughtered for human consumption.  Therefore, coming up with another solution, such as AI, Facial Recognition technology, was desirable for the most humane method of identification.\nWPM won an NSF Grant Phase I to explore the potential of AI, Facial Recognition Technology for horses.  WPM partnered with New Mexico State University (NMSU) to gather and analyze data of microchipped horses. \nNMSU Engineering Department under Dr. Laura Boucheron had some limited success.  The data sample was very small since they had only WPM microchipped horses and images with which to work.  The process of taking the individual frames and labeling them was arduous and time-consuming but was very important since it would be the framework going forward for each frame.  Despite the small data sample, there were approximately 500,000 frames that had to be labeled correctly but machine learning was able to identify specific horses. \nWe had a successful proof of concept and look to forward to developing our AI Facial Recognition project into accurate, scalable, usable, profitable software.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Roch J Hart"
