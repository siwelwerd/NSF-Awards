 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: Electro-optical devices based on newly discovered liquid crystals\r\n\r\nLiquid crystals are composed of rod-like molecules that are aligned parallel to each other. When placed between two transparent electrodes that supply an electric field, the molecules realign, changing the optical contrast of the device.  These devices brought a revolution in the industry of flat-panel TVs, computer monitors, and smartphones.  A detrimental property of conventional liquid crystals is that they are not sensitive to the polarity of the electric field, which results in relatively large operating voltages and long switching times (milliseconds). The project focuses on developing new liquid crystal devices in which the molecules show a polar response to the electric field.  The goal is to achieve fast (microsecond and faster) optical response driven by weak electric fields. If successful, the research will fulfill the demands of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, optical switching, augmented and virtual reality, and deep learning, which require electro-optical devices with a fast microsecond and nanosecond response. A combination of experiments and theoretical analysis will provide a superb opportunity to educate students in advanced electro-optical technologies. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to develop electro-optical phase retarders based on the newly discovered liquid crystals such as twist-bend and ferroelectric nematics, which show polar ordering and polar response to an electric field. The goal is to achieve ultrafast nano-and microsecond electro-optic response at operating voltages lower than those used in conventional nematic retarders. The activity will focus on the design of the device\u2019s substrate to impart a proper alignment of the molecules and then use the electric field to modify their orientation and electric polarity, which would generate a discernable optical response.  The research will establish the optimum architecture of retarders, defined by the alignment materials, type of ground-state nematic ordering, the spatial distribution of the electric field, and coupling mechanisms to the electric field. The electro-optic behavior of devices containing the newly discovered nematics is complex because of multiple pathways of field response, such as bulk and surface polarization, dielectric anisotropy, ionic transport, flexoelectricity, and order electricity overlapped with anisotropic viscosity, elasticity, and anisotropic surface interactions. The project will yield an understanding of how the polar and spatially-modulated molecular arrangements produce an electro-optical response. The transformative value is in the potential for new design concepts of electrically tunable and switchable optical phase retarders with fast response. A combination of experiments and theoretical analysis will provide a superb opportunity to educate students in advanced electro-optical technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The electro-optical response is through the realignment of the average molecular orientation, called the director, which is also the optical axis of the nematic. The director realignment is relatively slow, milliseconds, which is sufficient for applications such as displays, but is too slow for emerging developments in artificial intelligence, optical switching, augmented and virtual reality. For more than 100 years, nonpolar nematics were the only known liquid crystals suitable for displays and other electro-optical devices. In a dramatic turn of events, in 2017-2020, new polar nematics, called ferroelectric nematics, have been discovered, in which all molecular dipoles point in the same direction and thus produce a spontaneous electric polarization. The goal of the project was to establish how the ferroelectric nematic can be aligned by surface interaction, how they respond to the externally applied electric field, and whether and how they can be used in electro-optical devices.</p>\n<p class=\"Paper-Title\">Intellectual merit: The ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals are new to the field of electro-optical devices, as the study of their coupling to the electric field is in its infancy.&nbsp; The project uncovered that the structure of the ferroelectric nematics and thus their interaction with the electric field are dramatically different from the properties of the well-studied solid ferroelectrics. In particular, since the ferroelectric nematics are fluids, the domain walls in them are not rectilinear but adopt a curved shape that minimizes the so-called bound electric charge. The research demonstrated that these domain walls are of a shape of conic sections such as parabolas and hyperbolas. The avoidance of the bound charges produces spontaneous chiral ground states of ferroelectric nematic films. The finding is striking since the constituent molecules do not contain any chemical chiral groups. The spontaneous polar ordering was found also in thin monomolecular films of ferroelectric nematics, which demonstrated that the polar ordering is caused by electrostatic attraction of molecules with a chain of positive and negative charges along their long axes.</p>\n<p class=\"Paper-Title\">The research team developed electro-optical phase retarders based on the newly discovered ferroelectric nematics as working elements with dramatically improved response times (one microsecond) and strong birefringence change (about 20%), which is triggered by moderate electric fields. This technology is based on the electric field modification of the degree of molecular ordering in the nematic phase of ferroelectric material sandwiched between two glass plates with transparent electrodes. Theoretical and experimental studies of the electro-optical devices filled with oblique helicoidal liquid crystal demonstrated an electrically controlled total reflection of light of a preselected wavelength that can be tuned in a broad range from ultraviolet to infrared, swiping the entire visible range. One of the unsolved issues of electro-optics of ferroelectric nematics was the value of their dielectric permittivity.
