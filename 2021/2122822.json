 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation \u2013 Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is the conversion from a toxic to benign manufacturing sequence for polyurethane foams in the packaging, insulation, and construction markets. Polyurethanes rank the 6th most produced plastic in the world yet use cancer-causing, mutagenic and reproductive toxins in their manufacture. This project combines a 100% biobased source with non-toxic ingredients to synthesize polyurethane foams that can be recycled back to their starting materials at their end-of-life. The ideal of reducing plastic waste in the environment and eliminating the use of carcinogenic material is desired across many industries. However, the use of one-time-use plastics in packaging applications as well as foams used for insulation has placed particular environmental focus on the polyurethane industry. This project addresses the need to transition from petroleum-based sources to biobased feedstocks and enable industrially viable processes for non-toxic polyurethanes in diverse commercial platforms. The successful outcome of this project would be a complete  shift for the polyurethane industry by innovating new routes to polyurethanes that embrace a circular lifecycle. \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to enable a room temperature foaming and curing protocol for a biobased, non-isocyanate polyurethane. Polyurethanes are manufactured commercially from polyols and isocyanates; The isocyanate carries significant health and safety dangers as it is a cancer-causing, mutagenic and  a reproductive toxin (CMR). Non-isocyanate formulations in industry are currently very limited due to the inability to adapt new non-isocyanate chemistries to processing conditions typically used in industrial and commercial applications. To create reactive biobased precursors for synthesis, reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) will be employed to woody feedstocks to extract an oil rich in bi-functional aromatic compounds capable of functionalizing with cyclic carbonates. A previous protocol will be leveraged to synthesize non-isocyanate polyurethane foams with specific chemical linkages capable of depolymerization post-synthesis. Room temperature foaming will be aided by catalyst optimization and a ultraviolet light-assisted curing process through the addition of acrylated monomers and reactive diluents containing vinyl groups. This approach will also facilitate the ability to vary the viscosity of the reaction mixture to produce low density foams for packaging applications. The successful outcome of the project may demonstrate a commercially viable process for producing non-toxic polyurethanes at room temperature that are specifically designed for degradation at their end-of-life.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project aimed to translate a new technology for the synthesis of 100% biobased, non-isocyanate polyurethane foams into materials with commercially relevant properties and processing conditions. Polyurethane foams are used in many applications where lightweight cushioning or structural support is needed. Current polyurethanes use isocyanates to produce a fast, room temperature curing process that enables flexible foams of low density. However, isocyanates are a probable carcinogen, reproductive toxin, and the leading cause of workplace induced asthma. Polyurethanes are also one of the least recycled plastics, often with no other end of life options other than landfilling. Stemming from an initial discovery to product higher density, rigid foams with 100% biobased content, this project aimed to create lower density flexible foams to address the largest market sector of polyurethanes. This technology replaces isocyanates with a new route that is 100% biobased with less burden on workplace safety and on the environment.\n\n\nA major outcome of the project period was discovering a pathway to low density flexible foams that maintained the 100% biobased content of the original formulation. The new foams met the density and compression criteria of flexible foams set forth in the objectives and reduced the curing time to between 2-4 hours. Unfortunately, a room temperature curing option was not established. The new foams could be used to replace traditional foams in the cushioning industry for applications such as furniture, packaging, car seats, and other automotive interior components. Currently, no products exist for non-isocyanate polyurethane foams. The translation of the current technology would introduce a product that could simultaneously combat the crisis of persistent plastic waste while establishing a safer pathway for their manufacturing.\n\n\nThe project period also entailed investigating the commercial viability of the new foam through the ICORPs program and through a technoeconomic analysis. Through many potential customer interviews it was discovered that there is currently a large demand for sustainable products both from consumers and from a regulatory perspective. However, the low cost of current polyurethanes creates a challenge with regard to introducing a new sustainable material that would require a higher price point. While the value proposition of the sustainable foams has to do with establishing a sustainable identity with participating users and attracting a new generation of users who are particularly concerned about sustainability, a consensus was discovered among interviewees that only a 10% green tax was acceptable. To address these price concerns a technoeconomic analysis was completed that discovered several routes to decrease the price of production, however, it is still necessary to target higher value products where a higher price/lb. of the foam material is warranted.\n\n\nOverall, this project took a major step forward towards creating a new flexible foam alternative for traditional polyurethanes. The biobased and non-toxic nature of the material has the potential to change the current paradigm of polyurethanes from toxic to benign. It is expected that both the applied and fundamental research generated in this project will lead to new products that help an industry translate from a petrochemical foundation to one that supports a circular economy through support of the biorefinery concept of the future. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/07/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JamesSSternberg\n"
