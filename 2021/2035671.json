 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project may lead to an innovative self-defense wristband so that users will not have to remember to carry additional items. The potential users may already be wearing a Fitbit, Apple Watch, etc. This device will address the limitations of current devices, which include: charging a separate device, placing a device in the current purse or grabbing it before leaving the house, being alert when walking around, fumbling for a device if attacked, remembering how to use a security device, pointing the device in the right direction, or activating the device in a surprise attack.  The wristband will sense the user struggling and activate automatically. The wearable self-defense wristband will benefit current self-defense product owners, college students, concerned spouses and family members, people who exercise or work alone. etc.. The goal of this project is to enable self-protection for the public and achieve swift and sustained support.  It is anticipated that the wearable, threat-protection product could deter 1 million attacks by 2030.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the first Internet of Things (IoT), hands-free, and wrist-worn self-defense device. The device will be motion-activated. A gyro/accelerometer will be programmed to activate defense features when the correct motion is applied.  This wearable self-defense device will be easy and quick to activate, reliable to respond, safe to use, and comfortable for the wearer, as well as aesthetically pleasing. For the Phase I project, the features that will be enabled in the self-defense wristband include a siren, a strobe light, and a GPS ping to designated contacts and/or a 24/7 security firm that will call the user back and call emergency responders, if needed. The key technical hurdles are combining all targeted features in one compact device, while triggering the self-defense wristband consistently and safely.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
