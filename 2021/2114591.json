 "awd_abstract_narration": "Movement through their environments is a fundamental characteristic of most animals, (e.g., running, swimming, flying) and the mechanics of how animals perform this task have direct implications for evolutionary success because locomotion is involved with defense, finding mates, and foraging for food in efficient ways. For centuries, biomechanics research has provided a foundation for developing and testing hypotheses ranging from general governing principles of terrestrial locomotion to specific relationships between form and function of limbs and muscles. However, the vast majority of these studies have been conducted in laboratories on treadmills and tracks that bear little resemblance to the environments in which animals actually live. To truly understand the relationship between an animal's muscular and skeletal anatomy and locomotor performance, it is necessary to understand the mechanical demands of the tasks performed in the animal's natural environment. Understanding these relationships in natural habitats remains an important challenge. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the relationships between anatomy and locomotor performance through a series of experiments aimed at understanding in detail how different muscles contribute to movement tasks. Experiments will reveal how specific features of muscles and skeletons impact the function of particular muscles during locomotion in mechanically challenging natural environments. The outcomes of this research will advance knowledge about the functional roles of individual muscles, a topic that is rare in comparative biomechanics studies, and lay the groundwork for a better understanding of how mechanical energy is transferred through complex musculoskeletal systems. Application of this knowledge can lead to improvements in the design of autonomous robots, lower limb prosthetics, and other human locomotor enhancement devices.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this research is to elucidate the relationships between musculoskeletal morphology and bipedal hopping dynamics in desert environments using desert kangaroo rats (D. deserti) as an animal model. It is generally believed that bipedal hopping has evolved because it provides a locomotor performance advantage (e.g., faster top speed, higher endurance, acceleration capacity) related to exaggerated hind limb morphology; however a specific advantage has not been identified for all hopping species. To achieve the proposed objectives, this study will incorporate analyses of habitat use in the field, gait dynamics in the lab, in-vivo muscle dynamics and detailed computer modeling and simulations. This will be the first study to combine all of these methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between musculoskeletal morphology and performance. This powerful, integrated approach will be used to pursue two specific research objectives: 1) Quantify the mechanical demands of bipedal hopping on substrates and terrain utilized by D. deserti in their natural environment and, 2) Elucidate the relationship between musculoskeletal morphology and habitat use. The outcomes of the proposed research will establish direct links between locomotor performance under natural conditions and musculoskeletal morphology and muscle function in a way that has not been previously possible. An enhanced understanding of how and why animals hop will advance the fields of evolutionary biology, comparative anatomy, and biomechanics, and lead to improvements in the design of autonomous robots, lower limb prosthetics, and other locomotor enhancement devices. This proposal supports an Educational Plan to develop a field course to provide an opportunity for students to integrate what they have learned about ecology and evolution through research-driven, field-based analyses of habitat use, functional morphology, and behavior. Data for behavior and habitat use from multiple years of this course will provide a broader context for interpreting morphological and biomechanical results.",

Over the life of this project, our research made significant advancements in three broad areas: 1) characterizing the unique anatomy of kangaroo rats, 2) quantifying mechanical demands associated with life in the desert, and 3) understanding how kangaroo rats meet these mechanical demands. Our research revealed that kangaroo rats have exceptionally strong &ldquo;Achilles&rdquo; tendons, yet their tendons are far more compliant than had been assumed. These findings challenge what had been the presumed functional role of these tendons for over thirty years. In addition, we quantified the intrinsic properties of the muscles acting at the ankle and showed how force is partitioned across muscles that share a similar action. Using a detailed computer model of the kangaroo rat, we showed that the functional capacity of the hindlimb muscles is relatively independent of joint angle, suggesting that kangaroo rats should be able to produce explosive escape jumps from any starting position. Finally, we used a comparative approach to explore anatomical structures across kangaroo rats, and other hopping species.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">To quantify the mechanical demands of locomotor tasks in ecologically relevant conditions, we combined analyses of muscle function, joint dynamics, and whole-body motions. Our analysis of hopping on soft sand, the native substrate for desert kangaroo rats, resulted in a novel and unexpected outcome. At moderate hopping speeds, kangaroo rats can hop without any significant changes to their limb or center of mass kinematics. There is also no change in ankle muscle dynamics or force production between hopping on hard and sandy surfaces. These results suggests that kangaroo rats either experience the soft sand as if it is a hard surface or they are compensating for energy lost to the sand by recruiting muscles acting at the knee or hip. Our analyses of escape jumps, an evolutionarily significant locomotor task for kangaroo rats, showed they are capable of extremely high mechanical power outputs while producing jump heights that exceed ten times their hip height. Across jump heights, power output is primarily modulated at the ankle. In the field, we also showed how kangaroo rats use their tails to balance angular momentum and control body orientation.</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Our combined studies of anatomy and locomotor performance produced two overarching conclusions. First, under differing locomotor conditions, the biarticular ankle extensor muscles of kangaroo rats facilitate a wide range of functional plasticity including behaving like a spring, a motor, and/or a strut depending on the demands of the task. And second, the species-specific material properties of the ankle tendons facilitate maximal muscle power output during escape jumps and significant elastic energy storage and return during steady speed hopping. These findings change what we know about how kangaroo rats compare to other bipedal hoppers such as kangaroos and wallabies. Our results have been described in 17 peer-reviewed journal publications and 38 presentations at international, national, and regional conferences. Our research addressed the primary objectives of the award, but also laid the foundation for new projects that will seek to elucidate general principles of how animals have evolved to navigate in complex and challenging natural environments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Body\"><strong><em>Broader Impacts. </em></strong></p>\n<p class=\"Body\">As a CAREER Award, this project featured a significant educational and training component. Over the life of the project, this grant supported two postdoctoral fellows, two Ph.D. students, and 14 undergraduate researchers. Both postdoctoral fellows have gone on to research positions, one as tenure track faculty and the other as a director at a prestigious research institute. The PhD students are also currently in academic research positions, and many of the undergraduate researchers have gone on to graduate school, medical school, or research positions in industry. This grant also funded a research-based field course, Experimental Field Ecology, which provided a novel research experience for 19 students (13 women, 6 men) in the three years it was offered. As a component of this course, students worked with local high school students to mentor them on field-based projects. After moving to the University of Southern California, our broader impacts goals changed to reflect the recourses available. This included forming a partnership with the USC Good Neighbors Program which enabled us to develop and implement an after-school science program for a 5<sup>th</sup> grade class at an inner-city school. Finally, in conjunction with this grant, we organized a research symposium at an international conference. Due to COVID-19, the conference was made virtual. However, this change allowed 115 high school students to participate in a professional scientific conference. An analysis of assessment data is ongoing, but it was clear from discussions with the teachers involved that this opportunity generated outstanding enthusiasm among students and presented them with career options that they did not know were possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/28/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Craig&nbsp;Mcgowan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2114591/2114591_10419545_1693248088287_FieldResearchCourse--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2114591/2114591_10419545_1693248088287_FieldResearchCourse--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"University of Idaho Field Course\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2114591/2114591_10419545_1693248088287_FieldResearchCourse--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"University of Idaho Field Course\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students participating in the NSF funded field research course.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Craig McGowan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Craig&nbsp;Mcgowan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">University of Idaho Field Course</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2114591/2114591_10419545_1693248595498_SandHopping--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2114591/2114591_10419545_1693248595498_SandHopping--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sand hopping\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2114591/2114591_10419545_1693248595498_SandHopping--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sand hopping\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Analysis of hopping on sand and hard surfaces using a custom made rotary treadmill</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Craig McGowan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use -
