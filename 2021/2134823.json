 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to prepare a new generation of diagnostic products for early detection of diseases and to evaluate Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging therapies. PET imaging uses radiotracers (drugs and biomolecules labeled with safe radioactive materials) to provide information about biological events on a cellular and molecular level.  Such tests are necessary for the early diagnosis of diseases such as breast cancer as well as the evaluation of responses to immunotherapy. Currently, there are few chemical processes to produce radiotracers on an industrial scale. Typical processes use radioactive materials that are not produced by commercial vendors (radiopharmacies) and this, in turn, makes the production of these radiotracers expensive. Hence, the material is not widely accessible. This project uses a new chemical process in which radioactive materials from radiopharmacies are used. The chemical process is adaptable by commercial radiopharmacies so they can make the radiotracers on-site to provide to end users.  Since these commercial radiopharmacies typically have established large distribution channels, more patients, including those in under-resourced areas, will be able to benefit from these cheaper and better diagnostic products.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project further develops a novel technology in the preparation of a new generation of radiotracers for use in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The innovation combines specific reagents, reaction conditions, and chemical processes to allow the preparation of labeled biomolecules. The technology uses salts that are directly produced in commercial cyclotrons.  The process developed here allows the radionuclide to be added to the biomolecule of interest in the last step of the labeling process, retaining the radioactivity of the product and significantly improving the radiochemical yield. The technology allows the preparation of a wide variety of radiotracers with applications in the detection of neurological disorders, cancer, drug pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and target engagement, as well as in the preparation of dual imaging agents.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
