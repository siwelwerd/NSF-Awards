 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project is to develop next-generation monitoring & data informatics for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Industry standards to test WWTP performance typically measure  the chemistry of the incoming wastewater (influent) and finished output (effluent), without insight into the intervening stages.  This lack of data can result in significant environmental and human health hazards for end-users, as well as regulatory fines for WWTPs.  This project advances advanced microbial analytics specifically for water treatment to proactively predict and prevent negative impacts at reduced energy, chemical, and financial cost. This project has global application.  \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I Project will combine: 1) Advanced microbial analytics tailor-made for water treatment, including global analysis of DNA, RNA, and profiles from the system microbiomes; and 2) Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML).  This project identifies real-time WWTP performance predictions based on advanced microbial analytics (key drivers during treatment) to inform process control measures to optimize plant operations. For advanced microbial analytics, the objective is to prove reliable characterizations of microbial ecosystems in WWTP reactors, and to help maintain consistency and stability of the ecosystems over time.  This project will propose and optimize a sampling, analysis, and reporting plan for infusion at scale.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAdvanceH2O develops transformative next-generation monitoring &amp; data informatics for water treatment to overcome global water concerns from wastewater treatment to drinking sources.  Critically, we can resolve challenges not only in the US but also in regions such as Asia where 80% of the continent does not have adequate water treatment which all too often leads to significant health hazards.  Our innovations stem from our team's (Columbia University, New York) break-through work with advanced microbial analytics tailor-made for water treatment including multi-omics/meta-omics (global analysis of DNA, RNA, and profiles from the system microbiomes). \n\nThrough the NSF SBIR projects, AdvanceH2O's goal is to launch a minimal viable product (MVP) - an innovative wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) Analytics Management Package to provide real-time predictions of water quality during treatment processes.  The product uniquely combines WWTP reactor monitoring/sampling, advanced microbial analytics, chemical analytics, and novel plant process data analytics.  Benefits to customers include: predict and prevent operational failures, environmental/human health hazards, and punitive regulatory actions; simultaneously reduce energy &amp; chemical costs; and increase treatment capacity more cost-effectively with minimal new infrastructure.\n\nDuring SBIR Phase I, AdvanceH2O's overall objective was to prove that we can reliably characterize microbial ecosystems in WWTP reactors, and to help maintain consistency and stability of the microbial ecosystems over time.  Thus, the major activities and R &amp; D goals of the Phase I were to: 1) track microbial compositions and activities over time via advanced microbial analytics; and 2) by correlating incoming wastewater (influent) and finished output (effluent) chemical parameters with advanced microbial analytics, predict effluent quality.  We reached these R &amp; D goals via full-scale pilot-tests: comprehensive microbial sampling and analytics over a pre-determined time period at two (2) WWTP partners.  Once microbial stabilities were established, the data was incorporated into our novel plant process data analytics and combined with WWTP chemical parameters to predict effluent quality in real-time.  The results have been very promising as we achieved both of our SBIR Phase I Technical Objectives including 77%+ prediction accuracies for ammonium which exceeded our original target objective of 75%.\n\nAccording to Dawnbreaker-Customized Market Research (NSF Commercialization Planning Program), both the Global Wastewater Treatment Services Market and Global Market for Water Quality Sensors are expected to grow for the foreseeable future.  AdvanceH2O is a direct beneficiary of all these markets/trends.  As shown during our successful Phase I project, AdvanceH2O's product is transforming the existing WWTP testing paradigm from a \"reactive\" system to a \"proactive\" system.  As such, AdvanceH2O has received several Letters of Support for SBIR Phase II for pilot-tests which includes customer input into our MVP.  These pilot projects are a key commercial inroad into the traditionally very long acquisition process for new technologies in the water marketplace.\n\nIn addition to environmental/health hazards, according to Water.org, an estimated US$260 billion is lost globally each year in economic opportunities due to lack of basic water and sanitation.  Thus, our team has been expanding our scope to address the increasing emergence of new harmful pathogens (e.g., antibiotic-resistant genes).  Our team members have also been engaged in COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 WWTP related projects since its' destructive emergence in late 2019.  Most recently, AdvanceH2O has been establishing partnerships with other tech-innovators, including an NSF SBIR Phase II awardee, with respect to mitigating Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in WWTPs, a critical growing concern for our customers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/18/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Young Lee"
