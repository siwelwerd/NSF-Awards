 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities to work towards establishing the research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering, and mathematics undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at Alabama State University intends to investigate the role of microbial (bacteria, protists, algae) diversity and nutrient enrichment in the formation of Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB) in collaboration with researchers at Auburn University. The project will contribute to efforts aimed at establishing an active research and training program in microbial ecology for educating and mentoring minority students.\r\n\r\nAquatic microbial biodiversity and trophic complexity represent a diverse set of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes. The role of aquatic microbes in reducing nutrient loads (via nutrient assimilation or cycling) and controlling other invasive or harmful microbial species such as Microcystis spp., is acknowledged, though less explored. This project will mechanistically test the role of nutrient inputs and microbial biodiversity in the survival of Microcystis spp., and HAB formation in lab and field experiments using multi-omics approaches. The results from this project may contribute to a broader understanding of microbial factors underlying HAB formation and control in waterbodies.  Overall, the proposed research may help us develop strategies aimed at predicting and controlling HABs in the context of microbiome biodiversity and ecosystem functioning research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
