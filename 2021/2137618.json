 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Summary\r\n\r\nSubduction zones, where one tectonic plate descends beneath another, produce great earthquakes and thus pose significant seismic hazards.  Understanding the characteristics of the plates, such as the geometry of the descending plate (or slab), and the processes by which they slip past each other is key to assessing the extent of the seismic risk.  Parts or all of the two plates may be stuck together, accumulating strain that may be released in a large earthquake, or they may slide past each other more quietly, including in \"slow slip events\", where energy is released over days or years instead of seconds.\r\n\r\nSouth central Alaska is an excellent laboratory for investigating links between slab and upper plate characteristics and slip behavior in subduction zones. The region generated the second-largest earthquake ever recorded (a magnitude 9.2 in 1964), but major questions remain about processes along this margin.  Earthquake activity shows that the Alaska-Aleutian slab is subducting beneath part of southern Alaska.  This earthquake activity stops abruptly to the east of where the magnitude 9.2 earthquake occurred, leading to speculation that the slab may not be continuous throughout the area.   Recent GPS studies have suggested that the slab is present and locked with the upper plate across much of the area and seismic investigations have found evidence that transient behavior may also occur, but sparse data has limited further work.\r\n\r\nThe project team, from Purdue University, is installing four new continuous GPS sites and five temporary GPS sites.  The team is combining data from these sites with data from existing sites to investigate subduction processes in the area, including understanding the geometries of the slab and upper plate and determining where, and to what degree, the plates are locked.  The team is also searching for subtle evidence of transient events; if found, those events can be related to plate geometries and plate locking.  \r\n\r\nThe project is also providing local K-12 teachers the opportunity to participate in fieldwork and learn about how GPS data is used in tectonic studies.  Lesson plans developed with these teachers incorporate this project's research into a larger scale view of the region's tectonics and give students experience working with scientific data.  The team is spreading its research results to a larger audience through interactions with National Park Service staff and public lectures.  Overall, this project is generating and communicating a more complete understanding of processes in the easternmost Alaska subduction zone, which will improve seismic hazard estimates.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks to improve understanding of the relationship between complicated slab geometries (e.g. flat slab subduction, edges or kinks in slabs) and subduction-related processes such as upper plate deformation, coupling along the subduction interface, and transient events (e.g. slow-slip).  Data from 4 new continuous GPS sites, 5 new campaign sites, and existing continuous and campaign sites in the region are being used to examine strain patterns, the geometry of the subducting slab, coupling along the subduction interface, upper plate motion, and transient processes along the easternmost Alaska subduction zone.  The project is addressing the following questions: 1) What is the geometry of the subduction interface? Where is the eastern edge of the active subduction interface? How does this relate to the Wrangell Volcanic field and observed seismicity? 2) How does coupling vary within the easternmost Alaska subduction zone? Where does the transition from locked to creeping occur? How does this relate to the observed tremor, upper plate deformation, and seismicity? 3) Are there transient events resembling slow-slip events on the subduction interface? How do these transient events relate to the interface geometry and coupling distribution?  The new data are allowing an assessment of plate boundary characteristics on a much more spatially and temporally dense scale than currently possible, leading to more detailed and realistic models of the behavior of the Yakutat slab interface and its influence of the region's tectonics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSubduction zones generate the largest earthquakes on Earth and have a variety of associated hazards.  To fully understand the potential hazard, a number of factors need to be considered including the extent of the subduction zone, how locked or stuck together the plates are and if that changes with time, how slip happens along the subduction zone, and possible time varying signals that could influence data interpretation.  The eastern Alaska subduction zone generated the M9.2 1964 Alaska earthquake, but major gaps in understanding of this part of the subduction zone remained.  Measurements of surface deformation through the use of GPS/GNSS data provide insights into these issues, but the region had a sparse network of sites, especially continuously operating sites (cGPS) that give dense temporal data coverage.\n\n \n\nThis project used a combination of data collection, processing and analysis, and modeling to investigate the characteristics of the eastern Alaska subduction zone.  Four new cGPS were installed in the region (two at schools and two at lodges) and multiple surveys were performed at campaign (or temporary) sites throughout the region.  The resulting data set indicates that postseismic deformation from the 2002 M7.9 Denali fault earthquake in interior Alaska is still ongoing, with the largest signal near the fault and decreasing towards the coast.  Taking this signal into account, spatial patterns in the data and modeling results suggest that the subduction zone extends farther east and north than previously estimated.  The Yakutat block, which is a thick oceanic plateau going beneath southern Alaska, must be subducting at a very shallow angle to explain the surface deformation observations.  The GPS/GNSS data raise the possibility that the locking along the eastern edge of the subduction zone temporarily increased after the Denali earthquake, emphasizing the importance of evaluating time variable deformation along subduction zones.\n\n \n\n A graduate student and an undergraduate student were trained as part of this project, learning data analysis, programming, and geophysical modeling skills.  All data from the project has been archived at and freely available through the EarthScope facility.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Julie Elliott"
