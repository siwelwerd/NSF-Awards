 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robots made of metals, hard plastics, or similarly high stiffness materials are restricted in range of motion and shape changes. It would be extremely beneficial if a robot could be reconfigured on-the-fly to generate on-demand shapes and motions required for various tasks such as walking, crawling, and jumping. This award supports fundamental research on how to leverage mechanical modules with elastic instabilities, e.g., bistable modules that can rapidly switch between two stable states, to spontaneously reconfigure a robot\u2019s shape and motion. The research will also develop novel robots with multi-modal locomotion capabilities that can adapt to environments without modifying their mechanical structure. The resulting knowledge will advance the national health and benefit the society in unprecedented ways ranging from search-and-rescue in disasters (e.g., earthquakes) to monitoring in hazardous environments (e.g., nuclear plants). Additionally, this award will offer a unique opportunity to integrate insights from robotics, mechanics, design, and fabrication into intellectually intriguing and visually appealing broadening participation activities to inspire, engage, and educate students and the public alike, with the science and technology of reconfigurable robots. Examples of activities include senior design projects, summer program for high school students, and science and engineering festival.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to gain a fundamental understanding of a new class of soft robots made from soft/flexible modules with elastic instabilities. The goal is to enable soft robots with reconfigurable body shapes and leg motions for multimodal locomotion that can adapt to various complex environments. The strategy is to construct the robots using bistable modules connected in a closed loop for the body and an open loop for the legs, and then actively tune the energy landscape of each module on-the-fly to generate desired body shapes and leg motions for multimodal locomotion. Three research thrusts will be explored: 1) achievement of reconfigurable body shapes through an in-depth understanding of the energy landscapes of bistable modules via the use of quasi-static mechanics; 2) achievement of programmable motions through physics-based dynamics modeling using Cosserat rod theory and model-based reinforcement learning; and 3) validation of the models with the development of a robot with multimodal locomotion capabilities, such as walking, crawling, jumping, and climbing. The knowledge generated from this project will provide guidelines on how to systematically exploit elastic instabilities to generate programmable shapes and dynamic motions. \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It remains grand challenges to achieve fast, high-efficient, and maneuverable aqueous soft robots with high performance comparable to their biological counterparts, due to the compliance of their soft body. To address the challenges, the team has developed two generations of flapping-wing-based soft robotic swimmers by leveraging elastic instabilities. In generation 1 of the soft swimmer, it has a bi-directional soft bending actuator and bi-stable flapping wing. The surface swimmer shows a butterfly stroke&ndash;like gait, achieving a fast speed of 3.74 body length/s, high power efficiency, and low energy consumption cost via snapping in the wing. To overcome the limitation of surface swimming, the generation 2 of the soft swimmer utilizes a monostable flapping wing to reduce the actuation inputs from 2 to 1 by spontaneously stroking up via elastic restoring force-driven snapping back. This largely simplifies designs, actuation, and control for achieving a record-high speed of 6.8 body length per second, high energy efficiency, and high maneuverability and collision resilience in navigating through underwater unstructured environments with obstacles by simply tuning single-input actuation frequencies.</p>\r\n<p>The team also demonstrated leveraging elastic instabilities for creating autonomous and intelligent soft robots, especially in unstructured environments with obstacles. It remains challenging to create autonomous soft robots that can intelligently interact with and adapt to changing environments without external controls. To address the challenge, the team developed a twisted ribbon-based autonomous soft robot embodied with decision-making capabilities. It can self-avoid obstacles via adaptive soft body-environment interaction-induced snap-through instability for redirecting its self-rolling direction. It shows self-escaping capabilities from various challenging mazes, including mazes on granular terrains, mazes with narrow gaps, and even mazes with in situ changing layouts, without integrated sensing and external controls.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, 11 journal publications have been published including papers in Nature Communications, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Science Advances, and Advanced Materials. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broad Impacts:</strong>&nbsp;Under the support of the grant, the research results from this grant have enriched the curriculum of two undergraduate and graduate classes in applied finite element analysis and materials by design by integrating them as part of the course lectures and/or course projects.
