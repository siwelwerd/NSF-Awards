 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Training Group is led by seven faculty members at the University of Oregon whose research activities cover a wide range of topics in the fields of geometry, topology, representation theory, and combinatorics.  The award will support the training of at least four postdocs and 20-30 talented graduate students and will engage up to 40 undergraduates in summer research activities. The award will also support a summer workshop series in representation theory and a regional conference series in combinatorics and related areas. These researchers will undertake a collaborative approach to the supervision and mentoring of early career mathematicians. In addition to research training, a main goal of this RTG will be to broaden participation in mathematics through several mechanisms: flexible postdoc positions built on remote strategies for training and collaboration, development of skills for graduate students by incorporating them into the university\u2019s prison education program, collaborative mentorship strategies, and other activities, all aimed at the development of a vibrant, cohesive, and welcoming research community designed to help students and postdocs reach their full potential. \r\n\r\nThe projects conducted as part of this award will primarily focus on derived categories in algebra and geometry, equivariant topology, the geometry and topology of posets, and cohomology and representation theory in positive characteristic. The project activities will foster a flow of ideas among these various subjects, with the goal of creating new bridges and connections. Vertically integrated mentorship and learning opportunities will be key components of the RTG activities, offering valuable skillsets to the early-career participants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
