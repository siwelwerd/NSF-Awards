 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project focuses on assessing the security of smart healthcare systems (SHSs), aiming to persuade both the manufacturers of medical devices and healthcare organizations to deploy a more secure architecture. The advent of internet-of-medical-things (IoMT) technology brings many enhancements and possibilities for SHSs by providing opportunities to collect health information and enable real-time communication, increasing the efficiency of medical sensors, and reducing the latency between disease detection and treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the prevalence and need for remote and automated patient monitoring. However, with the rise of cyberattacks, secure and dependable operation of SHSs has greatly increased in importance and priority. This secure deployment seeks to directly or indirectly serve various stakeholders ranging from healthcare providers to patients. The project will explore implementation and commercialization opportunities with an initial application focus on developing security and resilient analytics for IoMT-based SHSs.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project develops a system to reduce the potential vulnerability of smart healthcare systems (SHSs) based on wireless sensor devices and implantable medical devices.  The proposed formal threat analysis tool is designed to be applicable to any healthcare systems that use machine learning models to make real-time control decisions from continuous data feeds. The tool acquires control logic from machine learning models, supervised and unsupervised, to perform a formal synthesis of potential threats. Using a state-of-the-art method, the solution identifies possible threats using system settings and adversarial knowledge, accessibility, capability, and attack targets as inputs. Initial results suggest that the proposed technology can improve the robustness and resiliency of SHSs. The threat vectors identified by the tool can be utilized to reconfigure the SHS architecture to make it less susceptible threats.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

However, compromised security protocols can raise the possibility of life-threatening events. It is essential to analyze the vulnerabilities of an SHS before deploying it. Prior research attempted to propose threat analysis tools, especially using adversarial machine learning-based threat analysis. However, the attack vector to attain the attacker&rsquo;s goal might not comply with the attacker&rsquo;s knowledge about the system configuration, capability, and accessibility. Moreover, prior work cannot work for advanced threats where ML-based classification models or defense mechanisms are adopted at the controller end. To deal with this, we proposed SHChecker, an automated threat analysis framework for SHSs that delivers real-time treatment using an ML-based disease categorization model and clustering-based anomaly detection model. SHChecker examines SHS&rsquo;s core decision-making and abnormality identification models by looking into possible attacks that can be carried out with only minor changes to sensor values and considering the attacker&rsquo;s constraints. </span></p>\n<p><span>SHChecker has a potential commercial impact. The security of modern SHS is not sufficient to gain people&rsquo;s trust. Cyberattacks are surging, leading to a significant economic loss in the healthcare industry. Hence, analyzing the threat associated with SHS before deploying is mandatory to reduce monetary loss and life risk. The absence of a potent threat analyzer in the SHS creates a need for a practical set of software tools to identify threat vectors and build robustness. However, through the Bay Area Regional I-Corps program, we discovered that the security of the SHS, despite being a matter of high concern, has received limited focus regarding resource and development activities. Hence, the customer discovery program reshaped our perception of the SHS domain and market, facilitating our commercialization plan. This I-Corps project helped us validate customers in automated patient monitoring across the full spectrum of drug administration, automated treatment procedures, vital signs collection, and routine monitoring. The project had two primary goals: (1) To conduct customer discovery to learn the product ecosystem for the developed smart healthcare security-related research product, which includes assessing the security of SHSs, aiming to persuade both the manufacturers of medical devices and healthcare organizations to deploy a more secure architecture; and (2) Get interactive training on entrepreneurship through building and gradually improving a business model canvas (BMC), interviewing different stakeholders, and discovering the customer ecosystem.</span></p>\n<p><span>The project identified and segmented the product ecosystem (i.e., buyer, recommender, payer, competitor, influencer, saboteur, end user, regulatory, and channel to market) and mapped various stakeholders with the categorizations.
