 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a green manufacturing technology for titanium production.  Special metals, such as titanium and its alloys, have unique corrosion resistance, high specific strength, and excellent bio-compatibility.  These metals may be used in the fabrication of high-performance parts for medical implants and other applications such as deep sea mining and robotics.  In addition, the proposed room temperature process for titanium production may enable the development of future alloys such as high entropy alloys, which are not suitable for the current high temperature manufacturing process.  Also, the proposed manufacturing process may be applied to extract rare earth metals from their oxides, satisfying critical needs in manufacturing electric motors for the US auto industry.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of an electrochemical approach for titanium (Ti) parts manufacturing utilizing low-cost pigments (TiO2) refined into value-added products (e.g., Ti powders/wires) at room temperature.  Though electrochemical approaches have been exploited by others, the proposed technology is based on a unique liquid metal alloy as the anode. The liquid metal alloy has a \u201ccatalytic\u201d capability, capable of accelerating titanium extractions from solid TiO2 without the need for elevated temperatures.  The resulting value-added products may be used as raw materials in additive manufacturing to deliver Ti parts.  This proposed room temperature process potentially may save more than 50% of the energy costs versus the traditional Ti refining process and may be easier to directly couple with additive manufacturing.  In addition, this technology may decrease the price of Ti powder from >$50 per pound to $4 per pound.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPure titanium is strong and corrosion resistant.  Titanium alloys retain the same strength and corrosion resistance as pure titanium, but take on the greater flexibility and malleability of the metal with which it is alloyed.  One drawback for titanium and its alloys, however, is their extreme sensitivity to oxygen: they are known as \"oxygen getters\".  When heated, oxygen likes to reside in the metal lattices and, meanwhile, form oxides on surfaces.  In AM (additive manufacturing), titanium alloys are used as fine powders, where large surface areas make them more pronounced in trapping oxygen.  Current industries have a high energy-cost process to remove oxygen dissolved in bulk titanium.  When this method is applied to titanium alloy powders, there will be inert oxides (TiO2 and Al2O3) left behind.  Powder manufacturers can mix these partially cleaned powders with low-oxygen virgin alloys and re-melt them to produce new powders for AM.  \n\nA circular economy of such is too short as it demands frequent expense in energy to a commodity that is only slightly \"dirty\".  The AM industry needs a new perspective in managing the oxygen \"impurity\" while claiming a significant win in \"green economy\".  We particularly focus on markets that could revive the used titanium alloy powders and also have large societal impact/needs.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Li Tan"
