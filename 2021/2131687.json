 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate change is having a major impact on society, the environment, and the economy. To help crowdsource potential solutions with accompanying roadmaps, the Geological Society of America (GSA) is implementing a rapid, thorough, and focused campaign to collect ideas, plans, and potential solutions via a concentrated outreach campaign to its internal working groups and its extended and international geoscience society affiliates. Goals will be to identify the biggest, most important interdisciplinary/convergent challenges in climate change on subjects where results can be addressed and delivered in the next 2 to 3 years. In addition, ideas for socializing and training geoscientists in the value and mechanisms of translational research and its benefits to society will be solicited. To accomplish this GSA will crowdsource through a variety of social media and virtual communication channels the knowledge, wisdom, and insights of the extensive GSA community through their 22 Scientific Divisions, global Associated Societies, and the communities they support, as well as contacts with state and local communities and geological surveys. Broader Impacts of the activities will be the generation of potential climate change solutions to mitigate the impact of a changing climate on environmental, societal, and economic arenas. They also include the engagement of early career scientists and members of underrepresented groups whose lives and careers are most likely to impacted over time. \r\n\r\nThe impacts of climate change on the environment and society are serious concerns for the environment and society. The Geological Society of America (GSA) is one of the two major professional societies of geoscientists in the US with over 22,000 geoscientist members in addition to other affiliated organizations. GSA will use this vast network to solicit input and ideas for combating deleterious effects of climate change and generating momentum for improving human's ability to adapt or mitigate its impacts. Through a series of virtual and social media platforms the Society will crowdsource input from across the spectrum of the geosciences and society by energizing and engaging its 22 Scientific Divisions, early career scientists, and those underrepresented in geoscience and whose communities tend to be most heavily impacted by policies on which communities and parts of the country will be most impacted by proposed changes and which will be considered most at risk. GSA will be generating input with the goal of producing a report to be submitted to the National Science Foundation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
