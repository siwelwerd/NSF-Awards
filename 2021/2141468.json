 "awd_abstract_narration": "Moving toward the fifth-generation (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G) wireless networks envisions a pervasively-deployed and data-driven intelligent edge network integrating machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). One of the most attractive features of an intelligent B5G network is to share data among objects to collaboratively make comprehensive decisions and provide better services to people. A huge amount of data is produced and collected by Internet of Things (IoT) connected through the BSG edge networks. Breach of integrity, authentication, or privacy of data may cause disastrous consequences as the dependence of the economy and societies on the security of data also deepen. B5G-based IoT applications must meet highly dynamic and diverse requirements in terms of latency, reliability, data rate, and user-defined performance metrics. In addition, most of the data is locally significant, which is generated, collected, processed on-site or near-site for instant decision making. Transmitting these data to a remote cloud center not only causes unnecessary delays but also wastes precious resources. Instead, there is a need for decentralized, online solutions that can proactively adapt to the B5G edge network dynamics.\r\n\r\nThis project will advance the research frontier of data security in B5G wireless network enabled intelligent edge computing paradigm. Aiming at paving the way to make blockchain an organic part of future intelligent networks, the investigator proposes a novel Federated Ledgers Architecture with fair proof-of-work (PoW) consensus enabled by Miner-twins in the Edge-fog-cloud paradigm (FLAME). Leveraging the Digital Twins (DT) and Microservices architecture, FLAME is a scale-able, decentralized data security solution for highly heterogeneous B5G IoT networks. This project consists of two technical components: (1) a Federated ledgers-based Decentralized Data Management (Fed-DDM) scheme for data assurance in hierarchical edge networks; and (2) a novel edge-fog-cloud Miner-Twins (MinT) architecture to enable a Fair-Mining-as-a-Service (FMaaS) consensus mechanism in heterogeneous blockchain networks at the edge.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Digital Twins (DT) are adopted to construct a Hierarchical Federated Ledgers-based Decentralized Data Management (DDM) that enables highly scalable IoT edge networks secured by a fair-mining-as-a-service (FMaaS) framework. With a fundamental understanding of the framework, several application scenarios have been identified and explored.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first technical objective we accomplished was conceptualizing a fair mining framework based on the digital twins of miners (MinT) in a lightweight blockchain network (Microchain). Following that, three application scenarios were considered to validate the proposed MinT and Microchain architectures: urban air mobility (UAM) networks, 3D point cloud datasets, and digital healthcare services (DHS). The results have been disseminated to communities of interest via paper submissions, conference presentations, prototype demos, and invited keynote talks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project has provided good opportunities to train students. Specifically, it has provided a unique opportunity for computer engineering students to explore a broad spectrum of applications for the future of immersive, 3D-connected virtual worlds. We have recruited one Ph.D. student, two MS students, and three high school students. They worked closely to build a small-scale Metaverse demo that contains three drones, multiple web cameras, smartphones, and smartwatches. The Ph.D. student was partially supported by this grant and earned a doctoral degree in 2023.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Significant Technical Contributions:</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. Inspired by the advanced features of Digital Twins (DT), an emerging concept that mirrors the lifespan and operational characteristics of physical objects, we proposed a novel Miner Twins (MinT) architecture to enable a fair Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism for blockchains in IoT environments. A lightweight algorithm is introduced to detect misbehaved miners who violate fair mining rules by timely monitoring a miner's footprint that twins mirror. In addition, we also designed a novel Proof-of-Behavior (PoB) consensus algorithm to detect dishonest miners that collude to control a fair mining network.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. We proposed &mu;DFL, a novel hierarchical IoT network fabric for decentralized federated learning (DFL) atop a lightweight blockchain called microchain. Following the hierarchical infrastructure of FL, participants in &mu;DFL are fragmented into multiple small-scale microchains. Each microchain network relies on a hybrid Proof of Credit (PoC) block generation and Voting-based Chain Finality (VCF) consensus protocol to ensure efficiency and privacy preservation at the edge network. Meanwhile, microchains are federated via a high-level inter-chain network, which adopts an efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocol to achieve scalability and security.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. We proposed a dynamic edge resource federation architecture to improve scalability, dynamicity, and security for multi-domain IoT applications. A dynamic edge resource federation framework adopts intelligent mechanisms to support efficient multi-domain service coordination that satisfies diverse Quality of Service (QoS) and security requirements. We propose a Hierarchical Integrated Federated Ledger (HIFL) to guarantee decentralized security and privacy-preserving properties in multi-domain resource orchestration and service re-adjustment. As a secure-by-design solution, HIFL is promising to support efficient, trusted, and secure end-to-end IoTservices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. Application 1: LightMAN. It is a lightweight microchained fabric for data assurance and resilience-oriented urban air mobility (UAM) networks. LightMAN is tailored for small-scale permissioned UAV networks, in which a microchain acts as a lightweight distributed ledger for security guarantees. Thus, participants can authenticate drones and verify the genuineness of data sent to/from drones without relying on a third-party agency. In addition, a hybrid on-chain and off-chain storage strategy that improves performance (e.g., latency and throughput) and ensures privacy preservation for sensitive information in UAM networks is adopted. A proof-of-concept prototype is implemented and tested on a micro-air&ndash;vehicle link (MAVLink) simulator.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. Application 2: SAUSA. As a Blockchain-based authentication network, SAUSA can record, track, and audit the access, usage, and storage of 3D point cloud datasets in their life-cycle in a decentralized manner. SAUSA allows efficient data processing and delivery to satisfy diverse QoS requirements. Supported by smart contracts and point cloud data on the blockchain, data owners have complete control of their 3D sensors and point clouds. Anyone can verify the authenticity and integrity of point clouds without relying on a third party. SAUSA integrates a hybrid on-chain and off-chain storage strategy that improves robustness and availability and ensures privacy preservation for sensitive information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>6. Application 3: MetaSafe. We envisioned a digital healthcare services (DHS) architecture for seniors&rsquo; safety monitoring in Metaverse. Based on monitoring data collected by sensors, the activities and status of seniors are mirrored in a virtual community in the Metaverse, where activity recognition, potential risk prediction, and alert generation are realized. By leveraging Non-Fungible Token (NFT) technology to tokenize identities and data streams of the DHS on the blockchain, an NFT-based authentication fabric allows for verifiable ownership and traceable transferability during the data-sharing process. An instant alerting system is introduced, combining the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) with the long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/14/2024<br>\nModified by: Yu&nbsp;Chen</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141468/2141468_10763417_1705277656515_06_data_authentication--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141468/2141468_10763417_1705277656515_06_data_authentication--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"3D Point Cloud Data\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2141468/2141468_10763417_1705277656515_06_data_authentication--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"3D Point Cloud Data\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This figure illustrates Blockchain-based data authentication framework.
