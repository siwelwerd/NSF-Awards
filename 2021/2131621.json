 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 9-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum.  The Belmont Forum is a consortium of research funding organizations representing over 55 countries focused on support for transdisciplinary approaches to global environmental change challenges and opportunities.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions. This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries.  The research teams will work to identify sustainable pathways to help alleviate the increasing and unprecedented pressure on the natural resources that interact to provide sustainable life support systems and essential benefits to societies such as food production and water quality and quantity.  The impacts of changes in land management and urbanization will be evaluated to develop sustainable soils and groundwater management options that will help create and maintain sustainable terrestrial ecosystems.  \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to develop a framework for the assessment, analysis and management of environmental risks and impacts resulting from anthropogenic activities and climate change on water-scarce critical zone systems.  This project seeks to define and implement actionable mitigation measures for critical zone sustainable management, aiming to shed light on human-water interactions, largely in regard to salinization and groundwater intrusion. This project utilizes participatory modeling and narratives derived from stakeholder engagement to identify critical challenges that the research program can help solve.  The project will develop science-based knowledge on the sustainability of water-scarce critical zone systems through an integrative approach that will include environmental, socio-economic and institutional aspects, and multi-stakeholder\u2019s perspectives.  This approach will highlight key knowledge gaps that when filled, can help stakeholders and decision-makers enhance the long-term environmental and economic sustainability of the water-scarce critical zone systems.  By integrating scientific knowledge, models and the direct involvement of stakeholders, the team will be able to define \u201csustainable adaptation pathways\u201d that describe the possible dynamic evolution of the water-scarce critical zone systems in the next 10- 20 years.  These pathways will account for the uncertainties related to climate change, land use patterns, human behaviors, and the related adaptation strategies and can be used ultimately used as decision support tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
