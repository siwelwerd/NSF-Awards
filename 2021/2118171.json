 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will build and evaluate sustainable pathways for participation in cybertraining within the Earth science fields. The project will enhance inclusivity by focusing on underrepresented geoscience students for training in cyberinfrastructure (CI), including computer programming, data analysis, and modeling, which are not typically parts of the geoscience curriculum. The project will enhance programming education for geoscience students and increase access and mentoring relationships in STEM fields, thus building sustainable CI for geoscience programing. Consequently, this project will lower barriers to entry for STEM students while developing networks and mentoring relationships in the geosciences.  \r\n\r\nThis project will provide geoscience graduate students with skills training that promote knowledge proliferation in software development and science communication. Students will learn to automate workflows, test code, manage code repositories, visualize data, and communicate research effectively, which will accelerate their research foundation and provide future professional opportunities. Given the size of the Spanish-speaking STEM student population in the United States, the current effort will focus on bi-lingual cybertraining. This CI project will provide opportunities to enhance coding skills and communication abilities, while expanding students\u2019 professional network and establishing mentors at multiple career stages. Cybertraining will occur in a series of virtual and in-person terms, where students will learn Python coding and data analysis, and will be exposed to a Hackathon to provide practical application of these skills. Course materials will be open source, which will create a sustainable cybertraining program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
