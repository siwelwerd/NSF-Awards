 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research team seeks to use the Pleistocene record of Indian Monsoon variation to examine how subdecadal rainfall dynamics change under disparate mean-states and global boundary conditions to refine the current understanding of the Indian Monsoon system\u2019s response to climate forcing.  Although Pleistocene archives have provided several essential insights into Indian Monsoon dynamics, inferences into subdecadal monsoon variability have been absent due to insufficient sample resolution.  Previous reconstructions indicate strong mean-state monsoon responses to variations in insolation and greenhouse gas forcing, but the manner in which subdecadal variability is modulated across these periods is unclear.  The current research effort focuses on periods with vastly different greenhouse gas, insolation, and ice-volume conditions to outline the sensitivity of monsoon seasonality and its short-term variability to global climate change. \r\n\r\nThe researchers will apply imaging and mass spectrometric techniques to extract subdecadal hydroclimate signals from previously collected archives from terrestrial and oceanic realms of the Indian subcontinent.  Specifically, the team will use previously collected cave stalagmites from peninsular India and sediments from Site U1446 in the Bay of Bengal, for which coarser-scale records of paleomonsoon variability have already been generated.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the research is to help confirm or refute the following hypothesis: (1) seasonality and interannual monsoon variability exhibit a fast (instantaneous) response to gradual insolation forcing; (2) summer and winter monsoon dynamics vary out-of-phase with each other across disparate Pleistocene climate states; and (3) seasonal rainfall in the core monsoon zone and peninsular India is modulated similarly by external forcing.\r\n\r\nThe potential Broader Impacts include integrating state-of-the-art geochemical techniques alongside paleoclimate dynamics to advance knowledge on how climate forcing modulates short-term Indian Monsoon variability and its extremes. The project will support a postdoctoral scholar and will significantly expand her research portfolio. The project will also support undergraduate researchers from underrepresented backgrounds at the University of Arizona and will involve southern Arizona high school students through the SARSEF program. This work will strengthen previously established collaborations between US and Indian scientists, which has enabled successful collection of samples in a societal responsible and mutually beneficial manner.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Whereas much progress has been made in understanding how external forcing due to subtle changes in the Earth&rsquo;s orbit manifest as dramatic climatic changes via Earth-climate responses in global ice volume and temperature variability (so-called 'Milankovitch cycles'), the response of tropical hydroclimate and monsoon variability is hotly debated. The 'zero-phase' global paleomonsoon hypothesis holds that precessional changes in the Earth&rsquo;s orbit are the sole driver of Asian monsoon variability over Pleistocene timescales, with a limited role for internal drivers of summer rainfall responding to orbital variations such as greenhouse gases and changes in ice volume. Primarily, this hypothesis has been developed based on the strong correlation between precession and speleothem &delta;&sup1;&#8312;O in records developed from subtropical eastern Asia (e.g., Cheng et al. 2016). However, this model has been used to explain Asia-wide changes over orbital timescales, even though there are sharp disagreements in the observed behavior of eastern Asian monsoon rainfall relative to other monsoonal domains of Asia reconstructed from the marine realm (e.g. Clemens et al. 2021). Moreover, vigorous debate persists regarding the interpretation of speleothem &delta;&sup1;&#8312;O as a proxy for monsoon rainfall in the first place.</p>\r\n<p>This NSF-supported project fills a significant data gap by generating robust multiproxy records of the South Asian monsoon domain over the late Pleistocene with reconstructions using both terrestrial speleothem &delta;&sup1;&#8312;O and freshwater proxies in marine sediments that are sensitive to riverine runoff. By integrating &gt;80 U-Th dates and ~2,000 stable isotope measurements on southern Indian speleothems alongside ~800 individual foraminiferal analyses, the project highlighted the coherence between terrestrial (speleothem &delta;&sup1;&#8312;O) and marine (foraminiferal &delta;&sup1;&#8312;O and Mg/Ca ratios) records from subdecadal (Dhar et al. 2024, Thirumalai et al. 2023a) to orbital timescales (Band et al. 2022, Thirumalai et al. 2023b, Zorzi et al. 2022). Our results challenge the &ldquo;zero-phase&rdquo; hypothesis of global paleomonsoon variability (Cheng et al. 2016) simply arising due to a function of precessional changes. Instead, our records, developed from both marine and terrestrial realms in southern Asia, show strong coherence on precessional timescales and point to greenhouse gases and ice-volume changes playing an outsize role in forcing paleomonsoon variability&mdash;in addition to precession and other orbital factors (Band et al. 2022; Thirumalai et al. 2023a, 2023b; Zorzi et al. 2022). High-resolution analyses, including secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS), showed heightened subdecadal ISM variability during periods of increased summer insolation and muted variability under glacial conditions (Thirumalai et al., 2023a). Our results are consistent with climate model simulations, which show that southern Asian monsoon variability is highly sensitive to greenhouse gas levels and ice-volume changes (Clemens et al. 2021; Thirumalai et al. 2023b). Our dualarchive approach also revealed strong connections between monsoonal rainfall variability and oceanographic processes in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea across timescales, with non-linear feedbacks between monsoon runoff, winds, nutrient-mixing, and primary productivity (Thirumalai et al. 2023b).</p>\r\n<p>References</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Band, S.
