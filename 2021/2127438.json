 "awd_abstract_narration": "Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) is one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas. NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security, and resilience of the Nation, the larger region, and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhances efforts in formal and informal education, and integrates the co-production of knowledge where appropriate. This award fulfills part of that aim by addressing interactions among social systems, natural environments, and the built environment in the following NNA focus areas: Arctic Residents and Education.\r\n\r\nInuit communities have sustained themselves in the Arctic for millennia through systematic knowledge about the ecosystem of which they are a part. There is a growing lack of access to affordable, culturally significant, and nutritious food in these Arctic communities. This food insecurity stems from multiple factors, including an increasing reliance on global industrial food systems, and the loss of Inuit knowledge regarding traditional food production. The latter has resulted in part due to negative stereotypes that label traditional foods as unsafe or unappetizing. Fermented foods are among those traditional foods that have been the most criticized, despite the fact that they provide a valuable source of nutrition and health benefits. The goal of this project is to support the resurgence of Inuit fermented foods by generating positive, factual outreach that recognizes and values the knowledge of Indigenous fermenters. This research will develop an Inuit-led, self-sustaining, and collaborative network in Greenland to promote Inuit fermented foods and food safety. Successful completion of these efforts will lead to improved scientific understanding of food security in Arctic communities from an Indigenous perspective.\r\n\r\nThe long-term goal of this research is to improve food security in Inuit communities. This goal will be accomplished by reversing negative narratives about Inuit fermented foods by creating positive, factual, desire-based feedback loops rooted in Inuit knowledge. The specific objective of this project is to record the Indigenous knowledge of Southern Greenland fermenters. These efforts will identify community food security concerns, engage stakeholders to bring together perspectives from Inuit fermenters and other Greenlandic food authorities, and integrate different forms of knowledge to identify critical research needs in Greenland and the Arctic more broadly. Successful completion of this project will benefit society by i) developing a foundation to address food insecurity in Inuit communities by understanding traditional Inuit fermentation practices; and ii) evaluating community fermentation practices that have become over reliant on non-Inuit infrastructure for food supply in recent generations. This research will center Inuit social networks and practices that sustain knowledge and interest in fermented foods as a means to secure safe inclusion of these culturally significant foods in local food systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
