 "awd_abstract_narration": "Implementation Projects in the Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provide support to design, implement, study and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the numbers of students and the quality of their preparation by strengthening science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and research. This implementation project at Alabama A & M University (AAMU) identifies professional development opportunities for STEM faculty and middle school teachers to enhance the teaching and learning experience for undergraduate STEM students at the university, as well as middle school students. The project is grounded in evidence-based practices, specifically leveraging student research experiences to bolster engagement and retention in STEM. The project is guided and informed by an ongoing evaluation, as well as by internal and external advisory committees.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to 1) augment a robust undergraduate program by retaining, mentoring, and graduating students from communities that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, 2) enhance the quality of the student learning experience and depth of knowledge by expanding undergraduate research opportunities, 3) engage pre-service and in-service middle school mathematics teachers to inform pedagogical best practices, and 4) institutionalize evidence-based pedagogical interventions. The project aims to advance knowledge and understanding in STEM education by investigating the effect of these interventions on student learning outcomes in STEM courses, as well as in retention, persistence, and graduation rates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
