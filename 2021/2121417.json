 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing, implementing, and researching the effectiveness of a program for undergraduate pre-service teachers (PSTs) to integrate computer science learning in elementary education. Many states in the U.S. have required that all public schools offer computer science courses or instruction. However, computer science is currently not offered as an independent course in most U.S. elementary schools. Hence, there is a critical need to integrate computer science into K-6 subject content courses to ensure every student has access to computer science learning. A systematic educational program is necessary for elementary PSTs to learn computer science knowledge and, more importantly, strategies for integrating it into K-6 subjects. However, it is challenging to place such an intensive endeavor into a single course in teacher education programs, so there is a shortage of PSTs who can integrate computer science learning in K-6 subject classes. The Technological Pedagogical Content Computational Thinking (TPC2T) model, a model for the infusion of computational thinking into another subject, will be used.  In this Engaged Student Learning Level-1 project, 175 elementary PSTs from 5 cohorts will participate in a series of sessions and student teaching over three semesters to learn and apply computer science across all K-6 subjects. This project will also generate an empirically tested PST educational framework and a computer science integration teaching model for classroom implementation.\r\n\r\nThis project aims 1) to improve PSTs\u2019 interest, self-efficacy, and knowledge of computer science integration in K-6 subjects by the end of their teacher preparation program, and 2) to advance the TPC2T model and make it a comprehensive model for K-6 computer science integrated teaching. To address these goals, the project team will conduct a mixed-method triangulation design research based on Bandura\u2019s self-efficacy theory and Lent, Brown, and Hackett\u2019s social cognitive career theory. The research findings and educational materials will be disseminated via the public project site, conference presentations, peer-reviewed journal publications, in-person and online workshops, and events hosted by NSF-funded centers, such as the STEM Learning and Research Center. This project is expected to benefit society by developing the teacher workforce in computer science K-6 education. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.  The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship (Noyce) Program is providing co-funding for this IUSE: EHR project to support the project's pre-service teacher preparation goals, which are well-aligned with Noyce Program goals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
