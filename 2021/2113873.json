 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Atomically Thin Multifunctional Coatings (ATOMIC) investigates the fundamental science of 2-dimensional (2D) material systems to enable a wide range of industrial and defense related applications. Phase II of the ATOMIC IUCRC adds a new site to the ATOMIC Center at Boise State University, thus extending the geographical reach of ATOMIC into the Pacific Northwest. A large focus of the work at the Boise State site is related to the fundamental chemistry needed to accelerate industry-scale synthesis of 2D materials via atomic layer deposition and large volume synthesis of 2D material inks for additive electronics manufacturing via inkjet, aerosol jet, plasma jet, and micro dispense/extrusion-based printing. The partnerships between ATOMIC universities, the industry members, and government partners are designed to serve the national interest by promoting the progress of 2D materials in science and engineering.  Undergraduate and graduate students will have the opportunity to engage in research projects across all three sites, interacting with a diverse range of faculty and industry partners. \r\n\r\nPhase II builds on the robust foundation of scientific innovation in 2D materials at Penn State and Rice University and expands it into scalable 2D materials printing enabled by the addition of Boise State University. Penn State and Rice have successfully pioneered fundamental research programs in novel 2D materials, such as graphene, hBN, MoS2, and WS2; and Boise State has excelled in the area of nanomaterial ink development and controlled precision printing such as inkjet, plasma jet, aerosol jet, and micro-dispensing. This combination of expertise will ensure relevant pre-competitive research of interest to the industrial members in areas related to large-scale production processes, electronics, sensing, energy, and protection. The joint research efforts chosen and designed by ATOMIC will concentrate on addressing key societal and industrial problems in areas of U.S. national interest that can be mitigated through advanced multifunctional coatings, such as infrastructure protection, internet of things (IoT) sensing, electronics, energy harvesting/storage, autonomous systems, and biological threat reduction. Student-centric activities include transformational and applied research, developing intellectual property, low-cost nano-manufacturing and industry internship opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
