 "awd_abstract_narration": "Observations across multiple astronomical scales point to the existence of unknown particles called dark matter, which constitutes the majority of the mass of galaxies, and an unknown uniform field known as dark energy that is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. The coupling of normal matter with dark matter or energy often manifests itself as a mechanical effect: displacement, recoil kicks, or acceleration. Accurately monitoring mechanical motion could give us unprecedented access to these minuscule signals. This CAREER proposal explores the viability of mechanical devices operating in either the classical or quantum regime as sensors for dark matter and dark energy. This work will lay the groundwork for the development of future detectors of astrophysical signals using precision measurement systems. \r\n\r\nThe proposed program involves using analytical and computational techniques for quantifying various noise mechanisms in the development of mechanical devices as sensors for dark matter and dark energy. In particular, a fiber-based approach to develop a broadband scalar dark matter sensor, a helium-based detector of light dark matter, and a membrane-based detector for screened interactions due to dark energy will be explored. As part of a broader theoretical effort, the spectrum of an ultralight dark matter signal and methods to enable efficient detection of a narrow band dark matter signal will be explored. By investigating the potential of various workhorse technologies as dark matter and dark energy sensors, the proposed program will inspire pushing state-of-the-art devices. By helping put experimental bounds on various couplings between the dark sector and normal matter, the proposed program will also stimulate high energy theory research into new models of dark matter and dark energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
