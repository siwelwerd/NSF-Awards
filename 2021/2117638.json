 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award enables the acquisition of the most modern instrumentation (high frequency/high field electron paramagnetic spectrometer) to study structure of compounds that contain unpaired electrons. Such molecules are called \u201cparamagnetic\u201d and have critical functions in living organisms and in the environment. This instrument will provide a cutting edge tool for studies in medicine and biology (new drug development, understanding of protein activity and interactions, and development of new molecules used for disease diagnostics), informatics and engineering (development of new class of memory chips, green energy materials) and will allow for significant technological jump that enables advanced studies of such systems. Studies of paramagnetic compounds have been hampered due to poor resolution of existing technology and this technique has not traditionally been used as a common tool for research due to its technological limitations and low availability. This instrument will not only add a completely new dimension to the research capabilities for many regional and national researchers, but also provide an essential learning tool for a new generation of scientists. Training will be provided to students and postdoctoral associates nationwide through an open house program advertised at research institutions throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe award seeks to purchase the Bruker ELEXYS E780, the first commercially manufactured high frequency/high field electron paramagnetic spectrometer in the United States, operating at 263 GHz. This would be the second instrument operating above 250 GHz; and the only high frequency instrument with electron-nuclear resonance capabilities. The ELEXYS E780 can perform experiments at both continuous wave and pulse wave mode, with electron-nuclear double resonance and electron-nuclear-nuclear resonance techniques and at temperatures down to 4 K. As a result, a significant increase in sensitivity and resolution of the spin orientation in the magnetic field can be achieved, which provides detailed structural information of the paramagnetic center. Detailed information regarding the nuclear distances from the paramagnetic centers and high spectral resolution can be achieved in solids, gases, liquids, cells, and in vivo. Projects that will immediately benefit from the acquisition of this instrument include research to understand changes in mitochondria function in diseases; photosystem II operation and development of man-made photosynthesis systems; conversion of biomass into valuable products; engineering of better polymers; development of new bioimaging molecules; and understanding the origin and fate of many environmental pollutants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
