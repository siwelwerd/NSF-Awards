 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over 80% of COVID deaths in the United States were people aged 65 and older, and over 40% of these deaths took place in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Current in-person eldercare practices caused numerous cluster infection cases in nursing facilities. The pandemic has also severely impacted home care, day care, visiting nurses, and all in-person care services in the US and worldwide, showing current nursing practices and systems are vulnerable. Those tragic cases could be better handled if in-person care could be supplemented by other means. This planning project will explore a new remote care system for supplementing all in-person services by exploiting telemedicine technology. During the pandemic, we have observed a rapid growth of telemedicine services; people can easily and safely get access to medical professionals from a distance. Once people use telemedicine and realize its usefulness, they will continue to use it even after the pandemic winds down. In this planning project, the feasibility and potential impact of if elderly people can be supported physically from a remote site, so that they can live safely and independently, will be investigated.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to provide elderly people with both informational and physical supports without on-site in-person care. Remotely-operated robots will assist elderly people in moving around and performing daily chores. Three major challenges will be investigated. First, the technology must be established for designing a walker-type, mobility-aid robot that can prevent the elderly from falling, assist the elderly in transitioning between sitting and standing, and provide a seamless support throughout daily activities. Second, under the supervision of a remote caregiver, the robot must communicate with the elderly user and gain a cooperative attitude from him/her in providing physical supports. Third and key to successful deployment of the technology, a  workforce development curriculum must be created. While the technology must fit the environment of eldercare, effective and engaging curricula must be developed for training care providers. To this end, broad expertise, ranging from robotics, biomedical and rehabilitation engineering, human-machine systems, networking and AI to geriatrics, nursing, psychology, business administration, and policy, will be brought together. In this planning project, a converging research team will be formed through expert interviews, site visits, online and in-person workshops, and webinars. A broad spectrum of input will be sought from technical, social, and economics experts and stakeholders for better planning for the establishment of a new NSF engineering research center for connected eldercare.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Family caregivers experience mental, physical, and financial stress, while care at nursing facilities is extremely costly. The shortage of care workers is getting worse every year. The COVID-19 pandemic made eldercare even more challenging. The pandemic has severely impacted all in-person eldercare services, including long-term care in nursing facilities and in-home care. In addition to the death toll of over 800,000 older adults and disruptions in care, many have suffered from decline in physical and cognitive functioning due to prolonged social isolation.</p>\n<p>An effective, pandemic-resilient eldercare system must be established. The objectives of this planning project are to investigate technological solutions to the serious eldercare problem and make strategic plans for overcoming the socioeconomic difficulties faced by the society. To better understand the eldercare challenges, the planning team interviewed broad stakeholders of eldercare, ranging from older adults and their families, caregivers, care service providers, physicians, and healthcare policy experts to researchers of robotics, biomechanics, rehabilitation, geriatrics, and AI. Based on the input from the diverse groups, the planning team has made strategic plans.</p>\n<p>First, technology must be established for assisting older adults to live in their own home: Aging-in-Place. It is a traumatic experience for many older adults to leave their home and familiar community and to move to a nursing facility. Care at nursing facilities is still required as the disability level increases, but delaying transition from home to nursing facilities can not only meet older adults? desire but can also significantly reduce the cost. The second strategic plan is to extend the technologies of pre-clinical diagnosis and provide older adults with proactive support. The risk of falling, for example, can be evaluated in the home setting and necessary aids for improving body balancing can be given proactively. These support services can be provided remotely; with new technologies, telemedicine can be extended to physical telemedicine where physical aids and remote monitoring are seamlessly integrated to perform early diagnosis of medical conditions and provide safety measures and daily aid. Establishing these technologies requires multi-disciplinary, convergence research at the scale of NSF Engineering Research Centers (ERCs). The planning team now proposes to establish an NSF ERC for Connected Health and Aging-in-Place Technology, which will establish a pandemic-resilient, remote support system for older adults living in the home.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>:</p>\n<p>The planning team has identified two technological gaps that can be filled through convergence research:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The gap between remote monitoring and physical aid: Extending eldercare services from merely monitoring to physical assistance is a high-risk, high-payoff challenge. Physical interaction with older adults must be safe in the strictest sense. We have found it technically feasible to build new-generation physical aids that allow for safe interactions with older adults by using novel materials and components of soft robotics. A Digital Twin health watcher that keeps track of an older adult's health conditions can be constructed based on advanced sensing, testing, and simulation technologies.

The ERC planning team has created three strategic plans, which we found feasible and actionable. First, the workforce development effort can be extended to upskilling and re-skilling of care workers and those non-STEM workers having no engineering background or interest. We can develop novel curricula and outreach programs to Engage, Enlighten, and Educate (E<sup>3</sup>) those groups, who would otherwise be left behind. Disparity in healthcare service access and the digital divide are serious challenges for those financially disadvantageous people. We can develop a low-cost digital health technology, the cost of which will be less than the budget ceiling of Medicare and Medicaid. The potential market of remote eldercare is huge.
