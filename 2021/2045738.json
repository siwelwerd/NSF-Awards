 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year summer REU renewal Site at Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) will involve a broad mix of students to conduct research in advanced manufacture of novel materials and bio-nano applications in a strongly mentored environment. MSOE 3D Printing complements metal laser-wire deposition at Midwest Engineered Systems and collaboration with Northwest University\u2019s Neuroimaging, provides opportunities for students to gain insight into customer discovery and exploration that culminate in unique solutions. All projects focus on impacting society by improving life standards through human health and efficient, sustainable systems. The REU team hopes that the diverse cohort - from primarily undergraduate institutions - will get to meet and present at a national conferences on undergraduate research. The Site provides a unique perspective on state-of-the-art 3DP research to all participants. New features of this site include the current participants being mentored by prior REU participants in Ph.D. programs and beyond, and being provided with opportunities to engage in K-12 outreach activities through the MSOE STEM Center.\r\n\r\nA technically diverse group of eight undergraduate students per year will participate in transformative problem solving of interdisciplinary projects involving additive manufacturing research at Milwaukee School of Engineering Rapid Prototyping Center, its Bioprinting lab and its synergistic centers of collaboration with industry and other institutions. The projects are uniquely poised for cross-pollination and customer discovery and creativity. With the unprecedented technological advances in 3DP affecting our daily lives, along with its features such as accuracy, reduction in development and delivery time, and reliability, it is becoming cost-effective because of the advancement of materials. Students will receive a career-enriching experience from a well-established and well-run program culminating in a national conference presentation and a strong desire to pursue a graduate degree. MSOE-REU has served as a research incubator for several first-generation and underrepresented students, especially from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs). This renewal site will build on previous success motivating participants to pursue continued education and careers in science and engineering. Not only does this project feature geographical diversity and technical diversity of the participants, but it has also embedded transformative research potential in many applications of 3DP with strong collaboration from both academia and industry. All projects impact society in improving life standards \u2212 human health and efficient, sustainable systems. New features of this site include the current participants being mentored by prior REU participants in Ph.D. programs and beyond, and being provided with opportunities to engage in K-12 outreach activities through the MSOE STEM Center.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
