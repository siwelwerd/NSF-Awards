 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). \r\n\r\nBoth humans and non-human primates have evolved defensive adaptations against malaria via changes in the genome. This doctoral dissertation research uses comparative primate data to advance knowledge about the co-evolution of primates and malaria or similar parasites, including how malaria has impacted the evolution of the primate immune system and identification of genetic mechanisms underlying the immune response to blood stage malaria. The project outcomes may inform public health relevant research on the human response to malaria. The project also supports outreach efforts that focus on increasing participation of underrepresented groups in STEM research through K-12 outreach and computational genomic capacity building. \r\n\r\nUsing a comparative functional and evolutionary genomics approach, the researchers identify primate genes and pathways that are differentially expressed in response to malaria infection, including those with species-specific involvement in malaria response. The researchers also identify signatures of malaria-imposed changes across primate genomes. The study outcomes can advance understanding of how the primate immune system has evolved in response to this host-pathogen arms race. The analysis uses an innovative approach to investigate primate malaria response in natural transmission systems. This study can help to determine which malaria responses arose through the host-pathogen coevolutionary arms race as well as explore how human and primate evolution has been impacted by the selection pressure of malaria.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
