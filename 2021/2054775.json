 "awd_abstract_narration": "A joint academic-industrial partnership between the University of Iowa and ebeam Technologies (eT) is proposed to study fundamental science of electron beam curing of polymers. The work could eliminate the need for free-radical initiators in polymerization, help understand the mechanism of the initiation step by ebeam, and could lead to more uniform curing profiles. Electron-beam (EB) curing offers a faster, lower-power, and solvent-free means of polymerizing inks, films, coatings, and adhesives when compared to thermal drying and curing processes.  The goal of this research project is to advance EB-curing technologies by developing structure-processing property relationships that incorporate the fundamental knowledge of how chemical structure influences radical formation and reactivity.  This understanding will also enable the extension of EB-curing technologies to a wider range of applications, including high-performance materials for the automotive and aerospace industries and low-migration materials for the food and medical product industries.\r\n\r\nThe following research topics will be pursued: (1) correlation of the radiation yield with monomer structure, (2) comparison of property development in EB- and UV-cured systems having equal radical concentration, (3) control of crosslink density through monomer structure and composition, and (4) minimization of migration through monomer structure and composition. Kinetic rates and radical concentrations will be measured using spectroscopic techniques to obtain monomer initiation efficiencies. Molecular weight distributions (for linear polymers), crosslink density (for polymer networks), and mechanical properties will be measured using gel permeation chromatography and dynamic mechanical analysis to demonstrate the impact of initiation mechanism, monomer structures, and process parameters on polymer physical properties. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry will be used to identify and quantify leachable materials and their diffusion coefficients for ultra-low-migration systems. Development of advanced relationships between EB kinetics and the resulting polymer properties may provide a level of understanding of EB-cured systems significantly beyond what is now available. In addition to training graduate students in an industrially-relevant area of study, outreach activities to K-12 and undergraduate students in STEM are planned based on polymer demonstrations incorporating project results. Special emphasis will be placed on recruiting underrepresented female and minority students to participate in this research project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Chemical modeling software was used to calculate the average energy required to form radicals on monomers via hydrogen abstraction. A library of monomer series was systematically developed to provide insight on how chemical structure influences radical formation so that experimental efforts could focus on the most promising candidates.&nbsp; Dose rate effects (DREs) were explored in these monomer series, confirming DREs to be based on number and type of labile bond, not monomer size. Although the yield of primary (initial) radicals is independent of dose rate, the instantaneous concentration of those radicals is directly proportional to dose rate.&nbsp; Finally, it was revealed that a non-reciprocity between dose rate and rate of polymerization results in DREs.&nbsp; A new protocol was developed for comparing outcomes from EB and UV polymerization systems with equal primary radical concentrations. UV polymerized systems resulted in higher conversions, while EB polymerized systems were more highly crosslinked, demonstrating the differences in secondary radical reactions for each system.&nbsp; While acrylate monomers polymerized well under either EB or UV irradiation, conversion of methacrylate monomers and mixtures with methacrylate monomers was substantially less or even zero. Additional studies revealed that methacrylate monomers formed just as many primary radicals as their acrylate monomer counterparts; however, those primary radicals do not convert to initiating radicals in the case of methacrylate monomers. Further comparisons were made between EB (high dose rate) and x-ray (low dose-rate) polymerization of acrylate and methacrylate monomers. In all cases, conversion of methacrylate monomers was on par with their acrylate monomer counterparts after x-ray irradiation.&nbsp; The slower dose rate in x-ray systems most likely improves conversion outcomes since the lower radical density reduces termination and/or the propagation rate for these monomers aligns better with x-ray exposure times. Gel fraction measurements were used to develop relationships between the ratio of initiating radicals to primary radicals and the extent of crosslinking in EB-cured monomer mixtures. In acrylate mixtures, the relationship between crosslinking and formulation appears to be linear up to a threshold concentration, at which point it plateaus. In acrylate/methacrylate mixtures, the relationship is more complex and appears to depend on the reactivity ratios of the respective monomers. A migration cell assembly has been manufactured, and a preliminary protocol for testing migration in EB films has been outlined so that, once promising mixtures have been identified, their efficacy as low-migration materials can be evaluated.
