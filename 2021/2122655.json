 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-\u00adServing Institutions (HSI Program), this Track 1 project aims to improve the quality, availability, and diversity of the STEM educational pipeline. By building a sustainable undergraduate field research program at Texas A&M University-\u00adSan Antonio, the project will develop a strong scientific and professional identity critical to the persistence in STEM majors and the motivation to pursue a science-\u00adrelated career. We will develop role models, facilitate student participation in federally-\u00adsupported research projects, and provide field training programs to heighten the scientific literacy and identity among the participating students. As the project team validates the impact of these practices and develops them into a curricular program, the project will have a long-\u00adterm impact of cultivating reliable domestic talent from underrepresented populations by improving the disproportionately low representation of Hispanic students in south Texas in the aquatic ecology profession.\r\n\r\nAquatic sciences are highly interdisciplinary and require a considerable amount of field experience that has not always been accessible to under-\u00adrepresented student groups. We hypothesize that improving the availability of field research opportunities and role models are key to the success of minority STEM majors. Thus, the specific aims of the project are to (1) improve scientific literacy among minority communities, (2) broaden undergraduate research experiences focusing on assessing the health of stream ecosystems, (3) improve recruitment, retention, and graduation of minority students by offering field research and mentoring programs, and (4) establish a sustainable model for a field-\u00adheavy curriculum via a collaborative model between HSIs, schools, public and private sector entities. These objectives will be achieved by implementing field-\u00adtraining activities supported by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), the National Hispanic Environmental Council (NHEC), and the Texas Aquatic Science project. The outcome of the project will enable the development of a university faculty-reviewed field-\u00adstudy curriculum for A&M-\u00adSA that will benefit students from multiple natural resource majors. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of the HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research (i) on engaged student learning, (ii) about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, and (iii) that improves our understanding of how to build institutional capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also draw from these approaches to generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nProject BREDEI (Broadening Research Experience for HSI STEM Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion), a Track 1 pilot project, was launched in late 2021 with a mission to address the workforce gap in aquatic science and water resources while offering high-impact research experience for under-represented Hispanic students in natural sciences. We measure the success of Project BREDEI by gauging how we meet the following objectives: (1) To improve scientific literacy among minority communities, (2) to broaden undergraduate research experiences focusing on assessing the health of stream ecosystems, (3)to improve recruitment, retention, and graduation of minority students by offering field research programs and culturally-appropriate mentoring,and(4)to establish a sustainablemodel for a field-heavy curriculum via acollaborative model betweenHSIs,schools, public and private sector entities.Texas A&M University-San Antonio (A&M-SA), a Hispanic-Serving Institutionin the underserved south side of San Antonio with more than 76% of the current undergraduate students of Hispanic heritage, iskeenly aware of the regions water security challenge in the face of water scarcity, rapid urbanization, and climate change threats. Project BREDEI therefore responds to&#8239;the need to&#8239;recruit and&#8239;develop an academically&#8239;prepared workforce&#8239;in a&#8239;socio-economically underserved region that has emerging water industry&#8239;in need&#8239;of&#8239;replacing an aging workforce.\n\n\nProject BREDIEpillared onfield training activities facilitated by the NSF-sponsored National Ecological Observatory Network&#8239;(NEON)&#8239; and a series of local programs partnering with organizations such as the San Antonio River Authority, the Edwards Aquifer Authority, and the Texas Stream Team administered by Texas State University. The outcome of this pilot projectenabled the development of a&#8239;university faculty reviewed&#8239;field-study curriculum&#8239;for A&M-SA,made possible by leveraging an existing field biology curricula&#8239;and established resources of the Texas Aquatic Science (TAS) Project, now administered by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.&#8239;The mid-termgoal is to build a sustainable program by identifying field sites and instructional resources that are logistically and&#8239;budgetarily viable. The objectives were: (1) to improve scientific literacy among minority communities, (2) to broaden undergraduate research experiences focusing on assessing the health of stream ecosystems, (3) to improve recruitment, retention, and graduation of minority students by offering field research programs and culturally-appropriate mentoring, and (4) to establish a sustainable model for a field-heavy curriculum via a collaborative model between HSIs, schools, public and private sector entities.\n\n\nTo meet Objective 1, we worked with local school districts in the historically under-resourced south side of San Antonio to engage with students in science classes. The PI, supported by students in the program, made presentations in middle schools and high schools, and successfully hosted a two-day camp on aquatic science during spring 2024.For Objectives 2 and 3,we developed a series of regional aquatic science training activities, including a 3-day, intensive, science-heavy, hands-on activity designed to allow students tofamiliarizelocalwatershedand water sampling and analysis. Tenstudentparticipantsstarted withthe 2-year program and six completed the entire program. The research experience, supported by project-initiated workshops to gain skills in using apps such as ArcGIS and Studio R, culminated with students presenting their work at various symposia. Many of the participants have enrolled or will be enrolling in graduate studies in the coming year. Objective 4 was achieved by the organization and documentation of the field training materials shared by the project partners. We look forward to evolving this outcome into a field research course in the future.\n\n\n\nThe program has yielded positive learning experience for our participants. We aimpilot a replicable and sustainable aquatic field training program that can be potentially embedded in a curriculum. Therefore, the feedback from the participants gives us a glimpse of what worked and what needed to be improved.We hereby quote the following summary from the Evaluator's report to demonstrate the feedback pertaining tothe training programs:\n\n\"Clearly, BREDEI is making excellent progress with the students....the students value the opportunities to (a) conduct hands-on field activities, (b) develop relationships with their peers in the cohort, (b) interact in less-than-formal academic settings with their professors, and (c) meet professionals working on water and related disciplines...the majority of the responses were either indicating strong agreement or agreement (80.6%).\"\n\"...It is evident that the students are gaining valuable experience related to all facets of the research enterprise  valuable experience for future professional roles or continued advanced degree studies. Most of the quantitative and qualitative responses were consistent with previous reports.\"\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: WalterDen\n"
