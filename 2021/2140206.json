 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth's carbon cycle consists of processes that consume and produce carbon dioxide.  The geologic record shows that the balance between consumption and production has undergone many disruptions lasting thousands of years or more.  This project focuses on disruptions that produce unusually high carbon dioxide levels and global warming.  Previous work has related these events to carbon that is released from particular sources under the right climatic conditions.  However, recent work suggests these events occur in a typical way independent of longer-term climatic trends.  This project proposes that such characteristic disruptions are natural consequences of mechanisms in the carbon cycle that are always active.  The project will quantify the evidence of such behavior in records from marine sediments.  It will also develop mathematical models to show how such disruptions could arise. To bring this subject to a wide audience, the project will hold public question-and-answer sessions on reddit.com's \u201cIAmA\u201d \u201cAsk me anything\u201d website.  It will also host a public screening of the 2019 HBO documentary Ice on Fire, which features related themes. The project will also produce new educational resources, support the training of a graduate student, and publicize its work in the news media.\r\n\r\nThe project's overall goal is to understand mechanisms responsible for disruption of the long-term carbon cycle.  The project hypothesizes that characteristic disruptions occur via processes of nonlinear amplification.  It proposes to detect signatures of such processes in paleoclimate time series and to explain these observations by construction of new models.  Past work has emphasized the role of specific sedimentary carbon reservoirs in generating certain individual events.  Yet it also indicates that more general pathways to disruption may have persisted through different climate regimes.  The project seeks to identify classes of such persistent phenomena related to intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of the marine carbon cycle.  The project will construct mathematical models showing how this could work and will seek evidence of their predictions in past fluctuations in carbon-isotopic data.  Such understanding will likely lead to new interpretations of the role of specific stressors, such as enhanced volcanism or the release of methane, as drivers of major warming events.  Results will also provide insight into the long-term risks of the human perturbation of the modern carbon cycle.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nMarine sediments contain records of the disruptions of the carbon\ncycle and climate in the geologic past. Past studies have typically\ntreated disruptions independently, with an emphasis on the relation\nbetween a specific context-dependent stressor, such as methane\nrelease, and the response of the carbon cycle and climate. This\nproject has instead sought to determine general aspects of the\nfluctuations of the climate-carbon cycle system, using tools and\nconcepts from the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems.\n\nOne major result addresses the statistical and dynamical character of\nclimatic fluctuations over the last 65 million years. We quantified\nthe typical amplitude of past global temperature fluctuations on\ntimescales ranging from hundreds of years to tens of millions of\nyears. We found that that on timescales between 4,000 and 400,000\nyears, the amplitude of fluctuations is independent of its timescale.\nThis suggests that one or more stabilizing mechanisms, such as chemical\nweathering, act to damp departures from a steady state on these\ntimescales. On longer timescales, however, fluctuations tend to grow,\npossibly as a result of long-term biological or geological changes in\nthe Earth system that cause the system's steady state to fluctuate\nquasistatically. Because these shifts have the statistical character\nof a random walk that shows no sign of being damped, they suggest that\nchance may have played a significant role in maintaining the long-term\nhabitability of Earth.\n\nIntermittent periods of major disruption nevertheless punctuate\nthe sedimentary record of climate and carbon cycle change.\nTo better understand their typical evolution in time,\nwe have created a method of time alignment to determine the\nsimilarity between different temporal sequences and to optimally align\nthem in a constrained way to obtain an appropriate average.\nWe find that disruptions in warm epochs last longer and have\na greater amplitude than disruptions in cool periods.\nThese results indicate that mechanisms via which disruptions are\ndamped---e.g., the weathering of silicate minerals on land or carbonate\nminerals on the seafloor---differ in the two cases.\n\nThe most severe disruptions of the climate and carbon cycle are\ntypically associated with mass extinctions of marine animals. We\nhypothesize that the severity of an extinction event is related to\nrate at which at which the carbon cycle changes. To test this\nhypothesis, we show that the fraction of species that go extinct\nduring a mass extinction is a predictable function of the rate of\nenvironmental change. This suggests that mass extinctions are an\nexample of \"rate-induced tipping,\" i.e., passage through a tipping\npoint that occurs when a parameter changes too rapidly. To better\nunderstand how such behavior can occur in an evolutionary system, we\nhave shown that models composed of many discrete individuals or agents\nexhibit the same kind of rate-induced tipping that occurs in simpler\ndynamical-systems models composed of a small set of differential\nequations.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/25/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DanielHRothman\n"
