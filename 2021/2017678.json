 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theory, methodology, and statistics in support of research in social and personality psychology has grown in complexity over the past\u00a0three decades.\u00a0These scientific advances are\u00a0partly\u00a0due to increasingly connected and diverse academic and professional networks among faculty. This project supports\u00a0the continuation and extension of Summer Institutes in Social and Personality Psychology (SISPP). Graduate students from social psychology and personality graduate\u00a0training\u00a0programs attend the advanced two-week intensive training program, led by\u00a0renowned\u00a0scholars and teachers in the field.\u00a0Training at this level\u00a0helps to\u202fadvance\u00a0these\u00a0fields\u00a0of science and supports the production of\u00a0important\u00a0innovations.\u202fThe\u00a0Institute also focuses\u00a0on broadening\u00a0the participation\u00a0of graduate students who\u202fmay be from groups historically and currently marginalized in these fields and who may not have intensive access to scholars in multiple subfields of their interest. Evaluation of\u00a0the previous training institutes\u00a0(supported by NSF)\u00a0reveals that graduate students who participate are successful in obtaining academic positions, peer-reviewed publications and funding for their research.\u00a0Affording graduate students with cutting-edge theoretical and methodological training enhances their ability to participate in interdisciplinary and international collaborations, which are\u00a0increasingly important across all of science.\r\n\u00a0\r\nScheduled every two years, SISPP provides an opportunity for approximately 100 advanced graduate students in social and personality psychology Ph.D. programs to obtain intensive experience and instruction in cutting-edge theories, research, and methods.\u00a0Because graduate programs\u00a0offer\u00a0strengths in different areas,\u00a0preference for attendance is given to students whose home institution does not offer strengths in the topics covered during a particular Summer Institute. SISPP has been successful in fostering diversity in the field, both in promoting the careers of members of historically underrepresented groups and\u00a0in\u00a0enhancing the graduate training of students from programs with different emphases and resources. SISPP has\u00a0been successful in fostering research collaboration and communication networks among individuals from different laboratories, universities, regions, and nations, and creating a collaborative scholarly community for a new generation of researchers. The diversifying experiences enabled by SISPP are critical for fostering creativity, innovation, and flexible scientific practices,\u00a0and for expanding\u00a0the scientific potential for\u00a0social and personality psychology\u00a0to\u00a0support\u00a0solutions\u00a0to\u00a0important societal\u00a0challenges.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
