 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to improve the representation of volatile chemical products (VCPs) within models that predict the formation and transport of fine particles in the atmosphere. The use of VCPs such as consumer products, pesticides, paints, and surface coatings can result in the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) that lead to the formation of ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA).  The results of this research will provide policymakers with better information to make informed decisions to mitigate the air quality, climate, and human health impacts from aerosols.\r\n\r\nIn this project, the PIs plan to perform chamber experiments to comprehensively characterize the gas- and particle-phase oxidation products from the photochemical oxidation of glycols and glycol ethers. This research will advance knowledge about the fate of VCPs in the atmosphere and help to: (1) understand the role of carbon number, molecular structure, and NOx on atmospherically relevant formation of SOA from glycols and glycol ethers; (2) elucidate the composition and formation pathways for gas- and particle-phase products from photooxidation of glycols and glycol ethers; (3) determine the chemical mechanisms and parameterizations needed to represent SOA and ozone formation from VCPs in atmospheric models; and (4) identify the contribution and influence of VCP emissions on the SOA and oxidant burden in the urban atmosphere using a chemical transport model (WRF-Chem).\r\n\r\nScientists in this project will partner with the Outreach and Education Center at Colorado State University to develop and share hands-on STEM kits for educators and middle school students to learn about atmospheric chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
