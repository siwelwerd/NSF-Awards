 "awd_abstract_narration": "This implementation and evaluation project aims to increase the retention and graduation rates of engineering students from groups who are underrepresented in their participation in STEM fields of study. The project team's activities will have a particular emphasis on Hispanic/Latinx students, providing them resources and career development opportunities to increase their academic and employment success in the engineering workforce. The School of Engineering at San Francisco State University, in a collaborative effort with Skyline College and Ca\u00f1ada College, will provide evidence-based faculty development, undergraduate research opportunities, and improved advising for students transferring from community colleges. The development of an HSI-Engineering Success Center will provide transfer students academic support, advising services, career counseling, and assistance in securing scholarships and internships so they can gain full-time employment in engineering. The project will answer two research questions: 1) What types of academic and non-academic supports will yield the highest retention, graduation, and employment rates? 2) What is the impact of faculty professional development on student learning experiences and success? The project will raise awareness in teaching and research to better equip a culturally diverse student population to earn engineering degrees while preparing to make a substantial impact on the technical workforce of the future.\r\n\r\nThis project will use a data-driven and evidence-based approach to identify the barriers to success of underrepresented engineering students and to generate new knowledge on the best practices in increasing students\u2019 retention and graduation rates, self-efficacy, professional development, and workforce preparedness. Three objectives underpin this goal. First is to develop and implement a Summer Research Internship Program together with community college partners and a Transfer Advising Days event for new transfer students. Second is to establish an HSI Engineering Success Center (ESC) to provide students internships, networking opportunities with industry, and career development. Third is to develop resources for the professional development of faculty members, including Summer Faculty Teaching Workshops, an Inclusive Teaching and Mentoring Seminar Series, and an Engineering Faculty Learning Community. The results and novel approaches, models, and tools developed will be disseminated through journal publications, conferences/symposia, and faculty learning communities. The knowledge gained will address a national need to promote a diverse and well-prepared STEM workforce. The Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic Serving Institutions Program (HSI Program) aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research (i) on engaged student learning, (ii) about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, and (iii) that improves our understanding of how to build institutional capacity. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also draw from these approaches to generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
