 "awd_abstract_narration": "The science of catalysis drives the creation of novel materials called catalysts that make chemical transformations occur that would otherwise be difficult or impossible. Catalysts are perhaps best known in automobile catalytic converters to reduce pollution in automobile exhaust. Catalysts are used to produce a wide variety of products of societal importance such as fuels, textiles, plastics, food and pharmaceutical products to name a few. Catalysts are used to produce common chemicals such as gasoline, textiles, plastics, food and pharmaceutical products to name a few. It has been estimated that catalysis accounts for over 95% (by volume) of all products and over 80% of added value in the chemical industry. About one third of the world\u2019s economy depends directly or indirectly on catalysis. Yet in spite of their immense importance, the development of new catalysts is still largely done by trial-and-error, and is therefore time-consuming and expensive. A grand challenge of catalysis research is the precise design and controlled synthesis of catalytic structures. Discoveries which transform catalyst synthesis from an art to a science will serve to enhance the productivity, energy efficiency and economic impact of a very broad industry base that involves the conversion of raw materials into finished products through chemistry.  The NSF Industry University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) for Rational Catalyst Synthesis (CeRCaS) addresses this challenge and the new university site located at University of California Davis/Berkeley emphasizes zeolite catalyst design and synthesis on the atomic length scale. Interactions of researchers in the new site with industry have already led to fruitful collaborations involving new member companies as well as the existing Virginia Commonwealth University and University of South Carolina sites. The UC Davis/Berkeley site will augment the current capabilities of CeRCaS by increasing participation of new pools of students at the respective campuses.\r\n\r\nThe University of California (UC) Davis/Berkeley site focuses on enabling rational design and synthesis of zeolite catalysts in CeRCaS through state-of-the-art spectroscopic characterization and atomic-resolution imaging. The site focuses on zeolite catalysts, because their regular porous structures facilitate unprecedented opportunities in developing connections between synthesis, structure, and function. Zeolite catalysis includes established processes such as fluid catalytic cracking for gasoline manufacture.  High value added applications of zeolite catalysis are emerging rapidly, such as for pollution abatement in diesel trucks, chemicals for polymers (and their upcycling and reuse), and pharmaceuticals. The researchers work with state-of-the-art catalyst synthesis and characterization capabilities as well as molecular modeling. The UC Davis/Berkeley site is dedicated to providing education of students as part of their career development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
