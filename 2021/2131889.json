 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is exceptionally difficult to capture the early phases of an eruption, especially in a remote area. The Fagradaldsfjall eruption in Iceland is unusual in that it was preceded by an earthquake swarm that lasted for nearly a month. This provided the opportunity to investigate the potential eruption site, collect high resolution (centimeter-scale) preliminary DEMs of the most probable eruption sites, generate associated DEMs and orthomosaics using UAS, as well as obtain the necessary permissions to access the area in the event of the eruption. Consequently, when the eruption began, its opening phase and development since have been monitored. Pre-eruption surveys of valleys that are most likely to become lava flow paths are being mapped. Maps are also being constructed of the surface expression of specific seismic events to determine links between surface fracture patterns and earthquake source mechanisms. Active lava emplacement processes are being measured to establish better constraints on effusion rates, lava emplacement dynamics, lava thermo-rheology, and lava cooling. In addition to providing information that will be useful for lava-flow hazards, the project is funding the research of a graduate student.\r\n\r\nThe 2021 earthquake swarm on the Reykjanes peninsula has generated >50,000 earthquakes since 21 February and on 3 March tremor was identified, signaling magma movement. In the following days, the magma came within 1 km of the surface and an eruption began at 8:45 pm GMT on March 19 in the hilly Kr\u00edsuv\u00edk region, which is located <50 km southwest of Reykjav\u00edk. The proposed effort constitutes an immediate response to the earthquake swarm and eruption to collect data for the scientific community. A Ground-Control Point (GCP) network will be established, including 60 aerial targets located using Differential Global Positioning System (DPGS) measurements and the installation of three meterological stations for continuous environmental measurement. These are needed to establish geodetic control for UAS and traditional aerial surveys as well s constrain environmental conditions, which is vital for thermal remote sensing. Once the GCP is established, Unoccupied Aircraft System (UAS) observations shall be obtained and used to generate 8\u201316 cm/post digital elevation models (DEMs) and 2\u20134 cm/pixel orthoimages, depending on local ground elevation. Data are being archived to ensure that GCP information and UAS observations are made freely available to the public via the University of Arizona\u2019s ReDATA system, which is a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) archive that enables rapid release of data, with digital object identifiers (DOIs). The research of a graduate student is being funded, and the information will be useful to local authorities for hazard assessment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The eruption was exceptional because it occurred in an uninhabited region, only an hour drive from the nation?s capital. The eruption was small, with low lava-fountains that primarily feed lava into confined valleys without generating large amounts of ash or releasing hazardous amounts of gas like other larger volcanoes. The event was what Icelanders call a \"tourist eruption\" because of it was both highly accessible and posed little risk to people or infrastructure. However, due to Covid-19, access to the Iceland was limited and few international scientists were able to study the Fagradalsfall eruption?despite its potential to inform models of lava emplacement. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, during the eruption Dr. Christopher Hamilton (University of Arizona) was in Iceland for his sabbatical and able to regularly visit the eruption site to collect data. Using a combination of ground-based survey techniques and advanced Unoccupied Aircraft Systems (UAS), he established a Ground Control Point (CGP) network composed of high-visibility markers that were precisely located using Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements. These GCPs enabled aerial images and topography to be geoencoded with latitude, longitude, and elevation information, which is critical for quantitative scientific investigations. He also conducted numerous surveys using UAS (otherwise known as drones) to generate high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and image mosaics that were geoencoded using the GCP network. Additionally, the drones were used to acquire high-resolution video of active lava channels to quantify lava flow velocities. All of these data products have been made freely available to the public through the University of Arizona Research Data Repository (ReData) using the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) system and a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license that enables other researchers and the general public to use the data for non-commercial purposes. <br /> <br /> The project also provided Undergraduate and Graduate students from the University of Arizona with the extraordinary opportunity to study an active volcano and gain new skills related to field-based research, geodesy, and UAS remote sensing. The work was also communicated to the general public through a variety of local (Icelandic) and international news agencies (including CNN?s Anderson Cooper 360 program), thereby promoting interest in volcanology and, more broadly, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and research. <br /> <br /> This work was enabled through the NSF RAPID program, which provides researchers with a mechanism to quickly respond to time-sensitive opportunities?like the 2021 Fagradalsfall eruption?by collecting and archiving data for community use. This mechanism enabled a rich-data set to be collected for the 2021 Fagradalsfall eruption with data products that will allow for new investigations of lava flow-field emplacement, including the effects of fine-scale topography and local lava fluxes on lava characteristics. These measurements are typically very difficult to obtain because they require being in the right place at the right time, which is exactly the context of this project.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/23/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christopher&nbsp;W&nbsp;Hamilton</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2131889/2131889_10736769_1663965128786_NSF_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2131889/2131889_10736769_1663965128786_NSF_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2021_Fagradalsfall_Eruption_Photograph_1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2131889/2131889_10736769_1663965128786_NSF_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2021_Fagradalsfall_Eruption_Photograph_1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">View of the Fagradalsfall eruption approximately 12-hours after it began.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Christopher Hamilton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;W&nbsp;Hamilton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2021_Fagradalsfall_Eruption_Photograph_1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2131889/2131889_10736769_1663965308930_NSF_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2131889/2131889_10736769_1663965308930_NSF_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2021 Fagradalsfall Eruption Photograph 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2131889/2131889_10736769_1663965308930_NSF_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Fagradalsfall Eruption Photograph 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">View of the early phases of the 2021 Fagradalsfall eruption with Dr. Christopher Hamilton in the foreground.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hamilton Research Group</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;W&nbsp;Hamilton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2021 Fagradalsfall Eruption Photograph 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2131889/2131889_10736769_1663965514715_NSF_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2131889/2131889_10736769_1663965514715_NSF_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2021 Fagradalsfall Eruption Photograph 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2131889/2131889_10736769_1663965514715_NSF_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Fagradalsfall Eruption Photograph 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Graduate Student Joana Voigt and Research Specialist Michael Christoffersen preparing an Unoccupied Aircraft System (UAS), or \"drone\", for flight.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Christopher Hamilton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;W&nbsp;Hamilton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2021 Fagradalsfall Eruption Photograph 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2131889/2131889_10736769_1663965759760_NSF_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2131889/2131889_10736769_1663965759760_NSF_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2021 Fagradalsfall Eruption Photograph 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2131889/2131889_10736769_1663965759760_NSF_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Fagradalsfall Eruption Photograph 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Research Specialty Michael Christoffersen standing next to a Ground Control Point (GCP) that will be used as a survey marker in subsequent aerial imaging campaigns.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Christopher Hamilton</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;W&nbsp;Hamilton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2021 Fagradalsfall Eruption Photograph 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2131889/2131889_10736769_1663966071382_NSF_5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2131889/2131889_10736769_1663966071382_NSF_5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2021 Fagradalsfall Eruption Photograph 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2131889/2131889_10736769_1663966071382_NSF_5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Fagradalsfall Eruption Photograph 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Lava-fountain formed during the 2021 Fagradalsfall eruption.
