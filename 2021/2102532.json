 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Linda Doerrer of Boston University and Professor Kimberly Ann Stieglitz of Roxbury Community College will study the specific conversion of carbon-hydrogen bonds to carbon-oxygen and carbon-carbon bonds.  These oxidation reactions are widespread and critical reactions in modern chemistry.  The cheapest and most sustainable oxidant is atmospheric oxygen (O2) but oxygen also is capable of oxidatively inactivating many catalyst systems. Almost all catalysts that utilize O2 in these oxidation reactions contain transition metals that enable these reactions to take place. This work will expand on current efforts to prepare new Cu catalysts supported by fluorine-rich \u201cTeflon-coated\u201d ligand systems that provide stability to the molecular catalysts.  The researchers will prepare new compounds in which clamping ligands hold metal atoms tightly to control reactivity between O2 and the substrate. The project will also probe oxidations using other metals besides Cu, particularly with Mn and V, and will extend the research to Fe-containing systems. An important thrust will be the development of catalysts that perform well in water and air to make these hydrocarbon oxidation systems more sustainable and environmentally friendly. The broader impacts of this work will involve undergraduate course development, student training, and a productive collaboration between Boston University and Roxbury Community College.  Roxbury Community College delivers instruction to a high percentage of students from underserved minority groups; thus this collaborative effort will be directed at increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields.\r\n   \r\nIn these studies, Professors Linda Doerrer of Boston University and Kimberly Ann Stieglitz of Roxbury Community College will study the oxidation of C-H bonds. This work builds on prior work of the researchers on Cu/O2 chemistry that has demonstrated the effectiveness of fluorinated alkoxide ligands to make highly reactive species for oxidizing C-H bonds. The nature and degree of encapsulation of redox inert counter cations, specifically K, on the catalytic activity will be investigated. Other counter cations of Li, Na, Rb, and Cs will also be pursued, as will an Fe-based catalysts system which will be accessed via two complementary routes. A Bordwell square approach will be used to generate a proposed {Mn(III)OH} reagent in situ that will be used to probe its thermodynamic properties. Exploration of the scope and optimization of reaction conditions with a benchtop-stable vanadium compound capable of catalytic C-H bond oxidation will be part of a hands-on experimental synthesis and spectroscopy class taught at Roxbury Community College by the collaborative team. This continued collaboration brings together expertise in transition metal complexes (Doerrer) and in organic compound characterization (Stieglitz), and will enhance the training of underrepresented minority students for STEM careers while exposing them to research at an R1 university.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis renewal award has enabled the continued exploration of alcohol oxidation chemistry in a particular system of Teflon-coated molecules that our research group has focused on for almost two decades. Oxidation chemistry is a fundamental chemical process in both biological and non-biological systems, whose name implies a connection with oxygen, but that is not a requirement. Our systems do use O2 in this sense, which is the removal of electrons from one molecule or substance by another and transferring them to O2. The new O2-containing product can be hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or water (H2O), as long as there are hydrogen atoms around. Again, this use of hydrogen is the case in our chemistry.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMaintaining the correct balance of oxidation reactions (with their counterparts, reduction reactions, that add electrons) in living systems is one of the most critical parts of homeostasis. Imbalances can lead to neurodegenerative diseases or cancer. Oxidation chemistry is also the process by which all human civilization, from the most primitive to the 21st century western world gets its energy. A fire is oxidation chemistry, as is burning petrochemicals, or part of the drawing of energy from a lithium battery. So is eating food to have energy, as all animals do. That process in particular uses O2 to take up hydrogen (H) atoms, that used to be connected to carbon.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe particular oxidizing molecules under investigation herein are described as Teflon-coated, because their outermost portion that is exposed to air (where there is O2) looks like Teflon. Teflon, as is well known from its myriad uses in coating cookware and making tight seals between threaded metal connectors, is very resistant to chemical reactions. The basic formula of Teflon is C2F4, therefore no hydrogen atoms are present, and that is a large part of its inertness. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe oxidation of hydrogen in molecules with carbon and hydrogen (hydrocarbons) by O2 is a source of energy. To keep the reaction under control, practical, and sustainable requires that it be controlled by a special type of molecule, called a catalyst. This award has supported the further development of molecular catalysts for the oxidation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Many current oxidation catalysts are limited in their lifetime and effectiveness because they have C-H bonds and can themselves be thereby destroyed or handicapped beyond their ability to function.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe molecules that we make are termed fluorinated alkoxide complexes of transition metals, with the fluorinated alkoxides being the Teflon coating part, called ligands, and they bind to the metals to make molecules called complexes because of the presence of the transition metals.\r\n\n\nIn most cases, the transition metals, like vanadium (V), molybdenum (Mo) and iron (Fe), must be paired with additional metals that are not transition metals themselves. We control the composition of the complexes to also have potassium (K), or lithium (Li), or sodium (Na) or sometimes derivatives of ammonium (NH4).\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nPrior awards supported investigations of Fe and Cu (copper) which demonstrated the validity of our Teflon-coating idea, but lacked some robustness to be useable on the benchtop, with special controls. Most recently, we reported a vanadium (V)-based system that works in air, at room temperature, and can catalytically oxidize alcohols to aldehydes. This particular award supported a more detailed investigation of the original alcohols studied (a group termed benzylic) and showed that allylic alcohols could also be oxidized. Furthermore, this new V-based catalyst has activity that is complementary to more well-know methods in the literature, and could be useful in the pharmaceutical industry. Related work with Mo is underway to understand this process in atomic detail, and see how it might be improved futher.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThis award attempted to continue a research collaboration with Roxbury Community College (RCC), a community college with a very diverse student body and considerable enrollment of socioeconomically disadvantaged students. The previous collaborative research effort was enthusiastically embraced by both BU PhD students and RCC undergraduate students, as a way for the latter to become more familiar with the work of the former, and the paths that might take one from RCC to BU. Both the pandemic and lack of decanal (Dean-level) support from RCC led to less time together than originally proposed. a\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LindaHDoerrer\n"
