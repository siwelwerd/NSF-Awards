 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Christina Li of Purdue University will investigate the systematic incorporation of a library of metal ions into transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and subsequently study their catalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with the expectation that isolated metal dopants exhibit high catalytic activity. The controlled functionalization of these two-dimensional materials has the potential to expand their uses because of the new and tunable properties that arise. After synthesis, Dr. Li and her research team use a variety of instrumental techniques to assess the structure and chemical properties of these materials and to test their performance. They are also developing laboratory modules for advanced high school coursework and teaching modules that are compatible for remote learning.\r\n\r\nThis research involves the exploration of the synthetic phase space available for doping transition metals and post transition metals into tungsten sulfide (WS2), the post-synthetic modification and stabilization of the coordination environment around the metal dopants to increase ORR activity, and the expansion of these synthesis, modification, and dopant strategies to other TMDs. Broader impacts include the development of electrochemistry modules for Advanced Placement chemistry courses and the development of remote teaching modules. While developing a molecular level understanding of TMD activation and functionalization, these materials will be subsequently evaluated for their tunable and stable electrocatalytic performance. This potentially broadly applicable strategy whereby metal-doped TMD structures are synthesized is expected to yield enabling new opto-electronic and catalytic technologies that have the potential to be utilized in batteries or fuel cells.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
