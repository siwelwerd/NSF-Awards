 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emergence of quantum computing, communications, and sensing systems are rapidly changing key sectors of the US infrastructure. Quantum systems are revolutionary and enable new and more efficient means for controlling, transmitting, and processing much larger information content than can be realized in current systems. New opportunities await the widespread manufacturing and use of these remarkable systems. During the last decade, significant research on numerous physical quantum systems has been pursued, with much progress towards the realization of high-performance, commercial quantum systems. However, the state of the developing quantum technology ecosystem will significantly benefit from focused advanced manufacturing research based on the specific challenges to realizing high-performance quantum systems. This project supports a two-day virtual workshop designed to disseminate information on the state of the art of different quantum system technologies, to identify and assess key challenges and opportunities in quantum system manufacturing and, ultimately, to invigorate and engage the community of researchers implementing quantum systems towards achieving manufacturing goals. Fundamental research in quantum manufacturing will revitalize American manufacturing, grow national prosperity and workforce, and reshape strategic industries.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuantum systems are based on the processing of quantum bits, or qubits, which can be realized in numerous two-state quantum systems, such as atomic states, spins, or photon polarizations. An initial set of qubit technologies has been identified for establishing the state-of-the-art and opportunities and challenges in manufacturing quantum systems. These qubit platforms are superconducting devices, ion traps, photonic devices, Si-based quantum dot and single electron transistors, point-defect based materials and devices, and emerging two-dimensional materials and devices, such as topological semimetals and insulators. Based on these considerations, the Quantum System Manufacturing Workshop seeks a research agenda for the community in the new area of quantum device manufacturing The goals of the workshop are several: 1) identify and recommend manufacturing research actions that will advance the success and utilization of current and future qubit platform and systems; 2) enlarge and engage a larger research community in computer science, materials, engineering, physics and beyond; 3) find synergies and seed cross-disciplinary research connections. By articulating the state-of the-art of quantum systems and identifying key challenges to manufacturing quantum systems, this effort will both inform the diverse academic, industrial, and national lab communities supporting research, development, and manufacturing, and will provide a framework for future research and development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
