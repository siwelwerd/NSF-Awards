 "awd_abstract_narration": "We, and the world around us, are made of stardust.  The goal of this project is to learn more about the nature of that stardust.  Some dying stars produce dust made of aluminum and oxygen, which the investigators will study through both astronomical observations and laboratory work.  In the lab, the team will make new aluminum oxide dust types to understand how they interact with light.  The investigators\u2019 lab measurements will be a guide to understanding how dust forms in space. The astronomical observations trace how the material condenses in molecular clouds to form stars, planets, and, eventually, life.  Astronomy is a gateway science, one of the first that excites children.  As part of this project, the investigators will also promote science across the K-12 curriculum and will benefit many children in the diverse city of San Antonio.  Most San Antonio school districts are majority Hispanic. The team will target students from under-represented groups, by providing cutting edge research via a well-tested spectroscopy demo. They will create a classroom demonstration that relates light and colors to the science curriculum, which will align with Texas' science standards (Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills; TEKS).\r\n\r\nThe team will (1) produce, characterize, and determine optical properties of stardust analogs composed of aluminum and oxygen; and (2) apply these optical properties to understanding dust formation around low- and intermediate-mass evolved stars.  In particular, the investigators will compare lab-measured spectral features to those seen in observational (mostly infrared) spectra.  New dust analogs will be prepared using four synthesis methods: smoke production, heating of hydrated aluminous solid, laser ablation, and a hot filament reactor.  These samples will be characterized structurally and chemically by electron microscopy, and spectroscopically in the visible to mid-infrared, in order to determine their complex dielectric functions.  Many of the astronomical observations are already complete, including mid-infrared spectra of nearby stars from the NSF-supported Gemini Telescopes.  They will also use the data to refine theoretical models for how dust forms around these stars.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
