 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). \r\n\r\nQuantum simulation is the practice of experimentally modelling a complex physical system using an analogous quantum system, where the underlying fundamental nature of the system is preserved. Ultracold quantum gas experiments provide an exceptionally powerful and tunable platform for direct investigations of a wide variety of physical phenomena, including non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, few-body physics, atom interferometry, and condensed matter physics. The development and creation of an ultracold quantum gas experiment presents many complex challenges for student researchers to overcome, requiring one to attain a variety of technical skills and knowledge, including electronic design and testing, ultra-high vacuum technologies, optomechanical design, electromagnetic modeling and control, and computational integration with automation programming. A table-top system with these high-performance technologies is an excellent training ground for undergraduate researchers in physics and engineering. Through small, well-de\ufb01ned projects, undergraduate researchers can develop highly applicable research skills sought after in the quantum information science and technology industry and in advanced research settings. This project will establish the infrastructure for rigorous, accessible, hands-on quantum research at a primarily undergraduate institution.\r\n\r\nThe research activities proposed here will build the foundations of a platform that will elucidate phase-separation dynamics and driven turbulent behavior in dilute-gas superfluids. Important questions that will be addressed in this project include: (1) How does phase separation behave in a channel BEC with both miscible and immiscible components? (2) How does quantum turbulence vary as the system interactions are quenched from being weakly miscible to immiscible? (3) Can hydrodynamic instabilities form between two spin states in a single isotopic BEC?  These studies have applications beyond ultracold atomic physics, from classical fluid flow and nonlinear optical systems to supernovae and neutron stars.  The Principal Investigator\u2019s student mentorship plan revolves around building and strengthening a student\u2019s physics identity. This includes developing positive relationships and technical lab skills as well as participating in the dissemination of research at conferences.  These activities will increase the recruitment and retention of historically underrepresented students in physics and engineering and will provide challenging research experiences in quantum information science and technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
