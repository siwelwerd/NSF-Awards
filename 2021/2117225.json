 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The Ohio State University is acquiring a photothermal Infrared-Raman microscope Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) imaging microscope to support the research of Zachary Schultz and colleagues Susan Olesik, Luis Rodriguez-Saona, Vicky Doan-Nguyen and Barbara Dunlap. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of biochemistry and cellular processes, electrochemistry, catalysis, and analytical chemistry. In general, the infrared and Raman spectroscopies measure the intensity of the absorbed and scattered radiation when it interacts with a sample, respectively. When radiation interacts with a compound, the molecules can begin to vibrate or rotate at certain frequencies. In a heterogeneous sample, this powerful analytical tool helps identify chemical composition qualitatively. The information can also be used to create an image of the material composition in a sample. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions. \r\n\r\nThis award to acquire a photothermal infrared-Raman microscope is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in chemistry and biochemistry. Studies focused on chemically imaging sub-cellular microenvironments such as drug targeting and lycopene metabolim in cellular models are pursued as are those focused on using IR photoimaging for energy storage applications such as multi-functional cathodes for electrochemical enhancement in Li-S batteries and tracking polysulfude suppresion. Other applications involving characterizing polymer nanoparticle composites and high throughput diagnostic screening are also being pursued.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe ability to measure vibrational modes of molecules in samples provides capabilities to identify the molecules, monitor chemical reactions, and quantify concentrations of chemicals in complex environments. This proposal procured an optical-photothermal infrared (OPTIR) and Raman microscope to enable vibrational microscopy using IR and Raman on the same spatial dimensions and from the exact same point in the sample. These abilities enabling research from a diverse collection of users from universities and local industry.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit. The Abbe diffraction limit has traditionally limited the spatial resolution of infrared microscopy. The recent development of optical photothermal infrared spectroscopy enables IR spectra to be obtained with a spatial resolution associated with a visible laser beam, providing spatial resolution of hundreds of nanometers for both the infrared and visible laser measurements. By measuring the Raman scattering from the visible probe beam, infrared and Raman spectra can be obtained from the exact same spatial location. The OPTIR microscope procured from Photothermal Spectroscopy Corporation provides these capabilities in commercial instrument that can advance the research at Ohio State and for other research groups in the midwestern United States.\n\n\nThe capabilities of the procured microscope were used to investigate a diverse set of applications. Experiments performed include environmental monitoring of microplastics, correlating signals from surface enhanced Raman scattering with chemical signals from the surrounding biological environment (e.g. cancer cells), to characterizing chemicals associated with disease and consumer products. The instrument purchased was one of the first models to incorporate a 785 nm laser to facilitate experiments with biochemical samples. The increased capabilities enable simultaneous Raman and infrared measurements, but also provided a new vibrational microscopy resource to enable research by users in Ohio and surrounding areas.\n\n\nBroader Impact. The diverse student body at the Ohio State University was provided with new resources to enable research opportunities. More than 50% of the OPTIR users identify as female. Many of the users originate from historically minoritized groups. The procurement of this instrument provided enhanced research opportunities to this group of researchers. In addition to academic research, the procured instrument was made available to local industry providing increased returns on this regional investment. A workshop, attended by both academic and industrial users provided both training and opportunities to advance a broad range of chemical applications.\n\n\nThe primary users of the instrument include 4 graduate students who identify as female, an external user who identifies as Hispanic, and users from both academic and industrial laboratories in the area. Thus far, 2 scientific manuscripts have been published and at least 2 additional manuscripts are undergoing peer review.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ZacharySchultz\n"
