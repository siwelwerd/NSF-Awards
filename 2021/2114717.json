 "awd_abstract_narration": "The deep ocean below 200 m is poorly known.  This dynamic realm is a vast repository for biodiversity, provides critical climate regulation, and houses a wealth of hydrocarbon, mineral, and genetic resources.  Observing the deep ocean at a level required to inform sustainable development and management faces significant technical and logistical challenges.  To address these challenges, the iDOOS project will implement a Deep-Ocean Observing Strategy (DOOS) that brings together U.S. and international networks engaged in sustained deep-ocean observing, mapping, exploration, modeling, research, and management to leverage each other\u2019s efforts, knowledge, and resources.  This implementation project will boost the DOOS community-driven initiative, working under the umbrella of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and endorsed as a United Nations Ocean Decade Action.  By connecting deep-ocean observers across disciplines, expanding the observing community to include non-traditional partners, and linking data providers to users, iDOOS will enhance the GOOS deep-ocean capabilities and target societal needs.  Through engagement with policy makers, regulators, and science coordinators, iDOOS will raise awareness and support for deep-ocean science, and bring science into critical decisions regarding climate, biodiversity and sustainability.  iDOOS will foster a community of future leaders informed in deep-ocean observing, modeling, and data science at a global level who are adept at communicating to regulators and policy makers as well as fellow scientists.\r\n\r\niDOOS addresses three main themes: (1) requirement setting for deep ocean observing; (2) promoting the coordination and implementation of integrated observing to address Sustainable Development Goals and societal needs; and (3) translating knowledge and data to allow science-based decision-making, regulation and governance of the global deep ocean.  These themes will be integrated and applied via the framework of regional demonstration projects.  iDOOS will work with the GOOS disciplinary expert panels to refine Essential Ocean Variables in terms of deep ocean requirements, and with network partners to maximize their implementation and use.  In addition, the project has two cross-cutting activities.  A focus on data/informatics will contribute best practices and standards to the requirement-setting theme, support activities across the working groups, and offer tailored training to early-career researchers.  The project aims to enable findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) deep-sea data and a data-enabled, deep-sea workforce.  A key element of iDOOS is the mentorship and training of the next generation.  iDOOS will assemble a network of Deep Ocean Early career Researchers (DOERs) drawing from collaborating networks, the broader deep-ocean observing community, as well as from developing countries and indigenous communities.  Through the theme working groups, the project will conduct training activities and meetings to substantially improve justice, equity, diversity, inclusion, and belonging among the participating networks and more broadly within deep-ocean science.\r\n\r\nThe Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) program is designed to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and prepare the next generation of U.S. researchers for multiteam international collaborations. The AccelNet program supports strategic linkages among U.S. research networks and complementary networks abroad that will leverage research and educational resources to tackle grand scientific challenges that require significant coordinated international efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
