 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded in part by the National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences directorate. It has broader scientific and societal impacts in addition to integrating undergraduate research and education. This REU Sites award to the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center supports authentic archaeological research for 10 undergraduate students from underserved populations over the course of seven weeks spanning three years (30 total students). Students actively engage in research alongside professional mentors within the framework of a long-term research project, the Northern Chaco Outliers Project. Students receive extensive preparation in STEM-based learning objectives that are necessary for future success within the discipline. This program provides students with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to secure future employment within archaeology and to pursue advanced degrees, emerging as the next generation of professionals, Tribal Historic Preservation Officers, educators, and leaders within the sciences. Inferences generated about past human behavior are utilized to create a better understanding of the principles that govern culture change worldwide and to address issues relevant to today\u2019s societies, providing critical information to guide future policy making.  \r\n\r\nThe Crow Canyon Archaeological Center initiated the Northern Chaco Outliers Project in 2017 with the goals of addressing important regional questions surrounding the expansion of ancestral communities in the Mesa Verde region, as well as broader anthropological research questions concerning human-environment interactions, the development of inequality/equality, the political role of community centers, and identity formation/dissolution. Although this Site has a regional focus, its results have national and global impacts. By engaging in scientific research focused on broader anthropological questions, REU students advance and share knowledge of the human past and contribute to cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary research surrounding human actions in the past, present, and future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

CCAC is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3). At CCAC, we believe the study of the past is an intrinsically worthwhile endeavor that creates more informed and sustainable societies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The CCAC Research Experiences for Undergraduates Sites &nbsp;Program (REU) focused on the Northern Chaco Outliers Project (NCOP) in the U.S. Southwest. This program brought together undergraduate students, including underrepresented students, and anthropological archaeologists&ndash;whose research and educational strengths lie in the cross-disciplinary fields of the social sciences, geosciences, environmental sciences, public archaeology, American Indian studies, and education&ndash;for the purpose of providing professional opportunities for student engagement in collaborative, on-going research. Students received extensive preparation in: 1) designing and conducting empirically-derived research; 2) archaeological theory; 3) excavation and survey methodology and laboratory analyses; and 4) archaeological law and ethics. Our goals were to provide students with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to join the work force and to pursue advanced degrees, emerging as the next generation of professionals, educators, and leaders within the sciences. This REU Site delivered place-based, multi-vocal, STEM curricula within experiential modules to foster authentic learning experiences in which the next generation of scientists will achieve excellence not only in undergraduate studies, but in future scholarly and professional pursuits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Crow Canyon Archaeological Center initiated the Northern Chaco Outliers Project with the goals of addressing important regional questions surrounding the expansion of Chaco-style communities in the Mesa Verde region (in present day Colorado), as well as broader anthropological research questions concerning human-environment interactions, the development of inequality/equality, the political role of community centers, and identity formation/dissolution. Although this project had a regional focus, its results have national and global impacts. Archaeology, more than any other scientific discipline, is best suited to study how humans engaged with environmental and societal changes in the past, lending insights to modern-day issues that will continue to resonate with future generations across the world. By engaging in scientific research focused on broader anthropological questions, REU students advanced and shared knowledge of the human past and contributed to cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary research surrounding human actions in the past, present, and future.</p>\n<p>By working closely with a diverse group of mentors&mdash;including professional archaeologists and Indigenous cultural specialists&mdash;students were trained with a high degree of ethics and values reflecting multi-vocal, modern standards. This significance cannot be overstated as the discipline of archaeology has a long history of abusing, ignoring, and disrespecting Indigenous peoples, concerns, and wishes, creating long-term cultural trauma and distrust. REU students engaged in mutually beneficial research, were taught ethical ways to respect cultural knowledge (including data collected in the field and laboratory) and engaged in trust-building relationships with Indigenous communities. This is the only way to conduct sound, equitable, and respectable archaeology in the modern era.</p>\n<p>Having NSF REU involvement as an undergraduate student increases the likelihood individuals will consider advanced degrees (and other professional careers) in science-based disciplines, especially those who are first generation college students. The goal of this REU was to enroll underrepresented students to increase diversity in the sciences. Of the 30 students enrolled in the 2021-2023 REU Sites programs, 60% identified as female, 30% as male, and 10% as gender fluid/non-binary. Students identified as 63% white, 33% Hispanic/Latino, 13% Indigenous American, 10% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 7% African American. Twenty-three percent of students identified as first-generation college students. Finally, 44% identified as enrolled in a two-year or small four-year college or university lacking a robust anthropology and/or archaeology program.</p>\n<p>Noteworthy metrics collected from the 2021-2023 post-program surveys include: 47% of students are extremely likely to enroll in a STEM master&rsquo;s program after completing this Site program; 70% made great gains in identifying limits of research methods and designs; 73% made great gains in understanding the relevance of research to coursework; 73% strongly agreed conducting NCOP research confirmed their field of study; 73% made great gains in feeling a part of a scientific community; 73% made great gains in understanding archaeological theory; 83% made great gains in engaging in real world science; 83% of students are much more likely to pursue a career in anthropology/archaeology as a result of completing our REU Site; 83% made great gains in understanding excavation, survey, and laboratory methodologies and analyses; 87% made great gains in preparing a scientific research poster; 90% strongly agreed they received intensive training in excavation, survey, and laboratory work;
