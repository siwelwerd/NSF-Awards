The workshop aimed to bring together world experts in muon spectroscopy (&micro;SR) and other techniques along with interested stakeholders to evaluate the scientific need to construct a new &micro;SR facility in the United States (US).  The more than 200 participants highlighted several key scientific areas for &micro;SR research, including quantum materials, hydrogen chemistry, and battery materials, and how each area could benefit from a new, high flux pulsed muon source.  Experts also discussed aspects of the &micro;SR technique, such as low-energy &micro;SR, novel software developments, alongside beam and detector technologies, that could enable revolutionary advances in &micro;SR at a next-generation facility.  The workshop concluded with discussion of a concept being developed for a new &micro;SR facility at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  That novel design concept was first envisioned by many of the same &micro;SR experts at a workshop held previously at ORNL in 2016.  The participants expressed that the current design had the potential to be a world-leading &micro;SR facility, and strongly encouraged the principal investigators to continue their work in order to refine the concept and determine instrument parameters that would enable new scientific opportunities.\n\nMuon Spin Rotation/Relaxation/Resonance (&micro;SR) is a technique that involves the use of spin-polarized muons that are implanted in a material to provide extremely sensitive measurements of the local magnetic field distribution within the sample.  The &micro;SR technique has led to important results in condensed matter physics, chemistry and semiconductor physics, among other fields. This technique is highly complementary to neutron scattering and since the two techniques share a common user base, 3 of the 4 existing &micro;SR facilities in the world are co-located with neutron sources. The exception is in North America, where the sole muon source is located at a meson accelerator laboratory in Vancouver, Canada, while the United States has not had a &micro;SR facility since the closure of LAMPF at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  There have been several efforts in recent years to address this shortcoming, most recently at ORNL beginning in 2016, and culminating with this workshop.\n\nSeveral recurring themes were identified during the workshop: the advantage of higher muon fluxes to enable new science, increasing demand for low-energy muon beams, the need for more software tools for muon site determination and analysis, and the role of multi-probe studies combining &micro;SR with neutrons and other spectroscopic techniques.  The primary method for enabling new science with &micro;SR is higher flux muon beams.  It is important for the detection of weak magnetic field phenomena, it has a greater sensitivity to molecular levels, and even to broader applications, such as using muon beams for fundamental physics experiments.  But by far the largest benefit of a high muon flux would be the expansion of low-energy &micro;SR capabilities. Low-energy &micro;SR beams enable more depth-resolved experiments, creating opportunities for measuring topological materials, novel states in interfaces, layered heterostructures and other new types of experiments.  In particular, there is an opportunity to focus the low-energy muons into a sub-millimeter beam to create a muon microscope for adding spatial resolution.  The consensus was that any opportunity to expand the capabilities of low-energy &micro;SR would be hugely beneficial to the scientific community.\n\nThe workshop often noted the complementary nature of &micro;SR to other techniques, especially neutron scattering.  Researchers always benefit from having access to other types of measurements of the materials.  The co-location of &micro;SR and neutron scattering facilities has proven this fact, and a next-generation muon source in the US would miss scientific opportunities by not being closely associated with neutron scattering, computing, advanced materials characterization and other spectroscopic techniques.
