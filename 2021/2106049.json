 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) is requested to support operations by the West Coast Van Pool (WCVP). The Pool currently consists of 15 modular laboratory vans that are all owned by either by NSF or Oregon State University. The pool is managed by Oregon State University and portable research vans are shipped all over the world in support of sea-going science. The Van Pool supports scientific operations and data collection aboard National Science Foundation (NSF) supported research vessels by supplying required additional specialized portable laboratory space and associated instrumentation. This proposal seeks SSSE for the following equipment:\r\n\r\nReplacement LSCs for West Coast Van Pool Isotope Portable Laboratory\t$78,700\r\nWater bag for load testing overboarding equipment\t$18,332\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$97,032\r\nBroader Impacts\t\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
