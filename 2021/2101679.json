 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address sunscreen effectiveness.  The proposed technology will enable application of sufficient sunscreen in a timely manner, thereby helping to minimize the incidence of ultraviolet-related skin damage including sunburn, age-related photodamage and skin cancer\u2014the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States with an annual estimated treatment cost of $8.1 billion.  For consumer end-users, this technology will provide an affordable, convenient, and accurate sunscreen effectiveness indicator to help keep them sun-safe.  For retailers, this technology will provide an innovative means to increase sales and grow the Suncare category as a whole without any cannibalization of existing sunscreen products (highly desired by retailers).  For sunscreen manufacturers/licensees, this technology has the potential to drive sunscreen consumption and sales by as much as 2-4x, grow brand recognition and increase unit profit margins.  \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the safety and accuracy of an ultraviolet/light-sensitive cosmetic dye (chromophore) intended to monitor sunscreen protection in real-time.  Sunscreen can prevent skin cancer, sunburns and photo-aging; however, users chronically underapply sunscreen and do not reapply often enough.  Though numerous attempts have been made to create indicators to measure sunscreen effectiveness, they are inaccurate, expensive and inconvenient, which accounts for their limited use and adoption by the industry and consumers.  Sunscreen Sun Protection Factor (SPF) ratings are the only global standard of protection and based on a sunscreen\u2019s ability to protect users from sunburn.  Therefore, the first aim of this project is to determine the photoaction spectrum of the chromophore by spectrofluorometry and compare it to the Erythemal Response Curve\u2014the relative type and intensities of ultraviolet radiation that cause sunburns.  The second aim will be to validate the chromophore will accurately change color when SPF levels drop below SPF 10-15 across a range of sunscreens of variable broadband (UVA/UVB) protection.  Finally, since the chromophore is applied directly to skin via a carrier ink, industry standard cosmetic safety tests will be conducted to ensure the chromophore is safe for skin application.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
