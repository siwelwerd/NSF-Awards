 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robotics innovations (unmanned ground, aerial, and marine systems) have been sporadically used for disaster response by emergency management agencies since 2001. Disasters pose a dilemma: on one hand, there is often an emotional urge to try anything in the hopes of coping with overwhelming potential loss of life and livelihoods; on the other hand, the poorly considered introduction of a robot into a disaster can lead to worse outcomes than doing nothing. This EArly Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) study will bring together leaders in robotics, law, emergency management, and public health with expertise in emergency management and policy to investigate robotics innovations and instances of ethical concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The result will be the first theory of responsible robotics innovation for disasters. This will transform how responders select robot technology during a disaster, ultimately saving lives, mitigating long-term environmental and health impacts, and accelerating economic recovery.  The project will provide evidence for anticipatory governance, such as new regulations and policies, to accelerate the adoption of safe, effective robots during a disaster while reducing negative consequences from either deploying unsound technology or deferring deployment of technology. The project will impact how engineering, law, and policy is taught, train graduate and undergraduate students in multidisciplinary approaches to science and society, and increase the diversity of students in the research pipeline. \r\n\r\nThe multidisciplinary team will conduct a rigorous analysis, featuring structured interviews with clinical healthcare providers, public health and public safety officials worldwide who deployed robots during the pandemic in order to understand the influences on adoption. The demand analysis will be complemented by prior work in quantitatively classifying the capabilities of the robot for a use case; together these orthogonal sets of user-centric and robot-centric influences will create a novel template for describing future innovation. The project will explore the legal systems and how they adapted to the exigencies of the pandemic, especially any correlations with national policies on robotics, and investigate emergent ethical concerns. The resulting quantitative model is expected to be both prescriptive for policy and predictive for future law and science research into robotics adoption. The model will revolutionize the methodology for constructing innovation theories. It will contribute to foundational responsible innovation research and comparative law, especially how groups interpret legal uses of robotics and how robotics impacts expectations of rights and responsibilities of agencies and developers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project documented 420 instances of where ground, aerial, and marine robots were used specifically for, or because of, the pandemic in 53 countries over the first two years. Robots clustered into six categories, or work domains: public safety (117), clinical care (100), continuity of work and education (91), laboratory and supply chain automation (52), quality of life (50), and non-hospital care (10). Follow up interviews with agencies suggest that the large number of instances in public safety were driven by &nbsp;agencies? public relations departments trying to promote the non-threatening use of drones. Instances in all six work domains emerged simultaneously within the first three months of the pandemic, not a sequential introduction, e.g., robots for public safety and clinical care first, then after time robots begin to be used for businesses and individuals. Across those six work domains, 29 different use cases were identified, with the majority involving disinfection, telepresence, or delivery. 60 instances of legal or ethical concerns were raised in seven areas: loss of privacy (13), robots replacing workers (10), violations of regulations (9), unproven claims of effectiveness (9), lack of regulations to protect citizens from abuses (8), unwarranted surveillance (7), and professional ethics (5). &nbsp;The use patterns were consistent across the top eight countries, the majority of which had national robotics initiatives, suggesting that countries that had a large prior investment in robotics had robots available and public acceptance of robots; therefore, these policy favored rapid adoption. The top countries who had adopted robots in Year 1 led in Year 2; again, reinforcing the need for investment in robotics as countries without a strong robotics policy but a large vulnerable population never caught up. The analysis also showed that 78% of the robots used in the first year were ?heritage? robots, that is, robots that were already commercially available for the specific use; there was very little on-the-fly innovation. The results lead to an evidence-based model of adoption of robotics during a disaster that states that the adoption is demand-pull, not innovation-push. The primary influences on adoption are availability, suitability, and risk; a group within an agency will use a robot if it is available, suitable for the use case, and low risk in terms of reliability and low burden on the workers and infrastructure. The project produced 5 journal articles; 3 conference papers (including an AI and Ethics award); 17 presentations to the robotics, public safety and public health agencies (such as the International Red Cross); and industrial communities, an open source database, and a website containing a checklist on what public agencies should lookfor when considering adopting robots and links to the database. The project trained six graduate students and three undergraduates, three of whom are female and two Hispanic, and added material to a popular homeland security course for professionals.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/08/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robin&nbsp;R&nbsp;Murphy</p>\n</div>\n<div
