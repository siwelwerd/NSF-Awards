 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many urban neighborhoods that have experienced decades of disinvestment and displacement lack dense, frequent, and reliable transportation options, despite the growth in light rail construction, shared ride services, micro-modes of transportation, and technologies that support demand responsive transit. Yet, significant mobility improvements could save residents time and money and improve access to employment, education, food, health care, and other necessary destinations. At the same time, transportation improvements could lead to redevelopment that causes displacement. To advance inclusive and opportunity-rich urban regeneration without displacement, this project envisions a multi-sector and intersectional process to design, test, and institutionalize an innovative community engagement method in a formerly Redlined neighborhood in Denver, Colorado, Valverde, that results in strong community adoption of a technology-supported, community-designed neighborhood mobility system that connects multiple local and regional transportation modes, including traditional transit (bus and rail), micro-transit (e.g. demand responsive shuttles), and micro-modes (e.g. bikes, e-scooters, etc.). This project's approach furthers the development of smart city technologies to promote resident health, prosperity, and welfare through the design and implementation of an equitable and adaptive community-oriented mobility management platform and supportive backend systems that incorporate policies for equity, community ownership, ongoing feedback, rapid system changes, low-barrier participation for micro mobility entrepreneurs, and affordable user subscriptions. While there are many competing transit and mobility apps, none to the project team's knowledge, accommodate all potential modes, local providers, and the ability for ongoing feedback that informs rapid system responses. This approach will also test processes for public institutions and nonprofits to co-construct community engagement processes with residents that are focused on contextually appropriate mobility solutions without triggering displacement. \r\n\r\nThe proposed system would upgrade and expand the Regional Transit District\u2019s (RTD) existing front-end (e.g., Mobility as a System (MaaS) platform) and back-end technologies to provide affordable subscriptions for mobility packages, community management and ownership opportunities for demand responsive micro-mobilities, and user feedback loops that inform rapid adjustments to bus and shuttle routes and schedules. This project will also create a pilot neighborhood mobility hub to enhance visibility, access, and connectivity among modes; foster community dialog; provide mobility information; and support related entrepreneurial activities, e.g., community bike shops. The engagement plan builds on the Denver Undesign the Redline exhibit, which combined artifacts, storytelling, photos, and interactive activities; and the City\u2019s use of photovoice methods for mobility planning. These exhibits help public officials and planners to understand community issues through the eyes of residents, which allows for more collaborative action.\r\n\r\nThis project is in response to Track A \u2013 CIVIC Innovation Challenge - Communities and Mobility a collaboration with NSF and the Department of Energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
