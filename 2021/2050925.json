 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Louisville will  establishes a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site to host a diverse cohort of undergraduate students across the nation in 10-week summer sessions to conduct research with faculty mentors on topics related to computer systems, including operating systems, parallel and distributed systems, embedded systems, mobile systems, and computer architecture. In addition to the significant broader social impacts of the proposed research projects, this REU site will impact undergraduate students from schools with limited research opportunities by helping them gain theoretical and practical knowledge in computer systems, training them in conducting cutting-edge computer systems research and inspiring them to pursue postgraduate education in computer science.\r\n\r\nThe end of Moore's Law is an exciting time to explore new computer system designs for the future. This REU Site includes a broad range of computer systems research topics, ranging from processor architecture to storage systems and from small-scale systems such as mobile and edge devices to large-scale systems including exascale data centers. Research projects will advance the state-of-the-art in computer systems by exploring new architectures for emerging applications on mobile and edge devices, energy-efficient storage stack designs for operating systems, energy-efficient embedded systems and microcontrollers, new software tools for data-intensive and high-performance computing, new graph analytics algorithms, holistic security solutions for IoT applications, novel distributed and explainable machine learning algorithms, new quantum acceleration techniques, and novel GPU enabled parallel document inversion algorithms for bioinformatics applications. A multi-level mentoring model will be followed through weekly meetings with the PIs, daily meetings with the mentors, and continuous interaction with graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
