 "awd_abstract_narration": "Situational judgment tests (SJTs) are increasingly understood as a valuable tool for predicting organizational performance.  However, many researchers have noted that they largely fail to represent the reasons certain actions are judged to be effective in organizational settings than others, or why respondents selected less effective actions. This project will focus on evaluating how elaborated situational judgment tests (ESJTs) \u2013 whereby respondents additionally rate the expected effects of responding in different ways to SJT scenarios \u2013 can address this limitation.  Past work has detailed that ESJTs provide avenues for representing a person\u2019s reasons for selecting different responses to job-relevant situations in the form of graphical causal models.  This project will explore how ESJTs can be used to (a) represent how diverse populations (e.g., individuals of different age groups, genders, or ethnicities) understand particular workplace scenarios, (b) represent the role of situational factors in altering the effectiveness of specific organizational behaviors, and (c) provide opportunities for teaching more effective organizational behavior. By bringing these processes to light, EJSTs can be used to not only improve the validity of personnel selection systems and inform more effective workplace training procedures, but also to advance efforts to create a fairer and more inclusive work environment.\r\n\r\nIn Project 1, ratings of the expected effects of different responses to organizational situations within a validated SJT will be collected from both working adults and subject matter experts.  These ratings will be used to create new indices of the degree to which employees show an expert\u2019s understanding of the effectiveness of different responses to job situations. These indices will be explored for their ability to predict organizational outcomes such as job performance and satisfaction beyond other valid predictors. In Project 2, a novel set of scenarios will be developed to detail how specific contextual factors (e.g., deadlines, relative organizational rank) alter the reasons for preferring one response to job-relevant situations over others.  In Project 3, ESJT-based instruments will be explored as pedagogical tools that can supplement case studies in MBA and other professional programs for teaching effective decision-making, and for detailing how populations with different backgrounds and levels of experience come to perceive and process organizational situations differently. These can then be used to provide more concrete points for discussing how diverse groups come to understand \u201cthe same\u201d organizational situations differently, and for teaching employees about the factors that make different responses to organizational situations more or less effective. The project will generate publicly available tools for creating and modeling data from elaborated situational judgment tasks, and for utilizing them effectively in both selection and job training contexts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project examined how elaborated situational judgment tests, or  ESJTs, can be used to represent the psychological processes mediating  effects of personal and situational factors affecting organizational  behaviors, and behavior more generally. Many of the outputs of the  project focused on detailing how effects of personal and situational  factors found to correlate with behavior can be more formally modeled as  occurring due to increasing the expected value of the behavior - or  expected effects on outcomes valued by the person. The empirical  studies from this project focused on adapting common SJT scenarios and  methods in which respondents were asked how likely they would be to  respond in different ways to different situations, such as to report  misbehavior performed by a coworker, to agree to work overtime, or to  engage in unsafe behaviors. Beyond rating their likelihood of  responding in different ways, (1) respondents additionally rated expected outcomes of responding in different ways to the situation, and (2) aspects of  the scenarios were experimentally manipulated to represent the roles of  situational factors.\r\n\n\nOur results showed that commonly explored phenomena in organizational  psychology can be understood in more formal and concrete ways through  the use of these ESJT methods. For instance, we demonstrate that the  finding that employees are less likely to report misbehavior by their  superiors than subordinates can be attributed to an increased belief  that may face job-related punishments for doing so; and that people who  more strongly value following rules do so in part due to their increased  belief that following the rules will protect them from harmful  outcomes. We show how more elaborated causal models can also be created  to represent how leader behaviors can affect subordinate psychological  and behavioral reactions.\r\n\n\nThe studies illustrate how current SJT methods can be elaborated to better represent the underlying reasoning behind  engaging in unethical or unsafe organizational behavior as well as how  leader actions can motivate or inhibit such behaviors in their  subordinates. We additionally show how the methods can be used to  represent expectancy*value (E*V) models within a moderated mediation  framework to represent the role of personal and situational factors on  behavior, and how these models can be represented as graphical causal  models. More generally, the methods developed here offer opportunities  to integrate the increasing use of SJTs for assessment purposes with  economic and utility models of behavior that better detail why different responses are preferred by respondents or by subject matter  experts. The methods and results of this project will shed light on why  diverse populations (e.g., individuals of different age groups,  genders, or ethnicities) understand workplace scenarios differently, and  why specific situational factors or personality aspects alter the  likelihood of engaging in important organizational behaviors.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DustinWood\n"
