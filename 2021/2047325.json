 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this CAREER grant, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Joseph Zadrozny of the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University aims to develop new classes of molecules with environmentally sensitive quantum properties. Such fundamental research lies at the core of efforts to establish new systems for quantum sensing and/or quantum computing. The goal of the research is to understand how to amplify environmental detection by the quantum states of metal-ion magnetic nuclei, which would be essential for the development of next-generation quantum bits or magnetic resonance imaging sensors. The project lies at the interface of coordination chemistry, physics, and quantum information science and will thus educate scientists at all levels in these areas. Outreach activities with a local science museum and through a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics)  kit are planned as new ways to expose students at an early stage to the exciting but complex quantum world.\r\n\r\nThe quantum states of nuclear spins in metal complexes are generally long-lived owing to weak environmental sensitivity. Understanding how to amplify this sensitivity may lead to systems that are highly environmentally sensitive yet with long-lived quantum states, which is a fundamental challenge. In this project, Dr.Joseph Zadrozny and his team will study hybrid electronic/nuclear spin systems in order to understand how to control environmental sensitivity. Three specific classes of hybrid electron/nuclear complexes will be prepared to answer the following questions: 1) Can spin-crossovers be harnessed to amplify the environmental sensing by metal-ion nuclear spins? 2) Can valence tautomerizations be used to effect environmental detection capabilities by a metal-ion nuclear spin? 3) What are the design principles for a radical satellite to best amplify the response of metal-ion spin dynamics to changes in local chemistry?\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
