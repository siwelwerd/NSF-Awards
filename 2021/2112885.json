 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a structured light optical monitoring system for metal additive manufacturing (MAM). Metal additive manufacturing (MAM) is a rapidly expanding industry, impacting aerospace, energy, and medical industries, among others. However, the lack of in-process monitoring for part quality is recognized as a hindrance to rapid, wide-scale industry adoption. The monitoring system under development is designed to be implemented within the MAM process to measure the quality of parts and detect defects in an in-process fashion.  The proposed technology may allow for part qualification and increased part output while reducing the cost of the fabrication process and increasing US manufacturing competitiveness.  In addition, the proposed technology may reduce material waste when compared to traditional subtractive techniques.  The goal of this technology is to reduce the per-part cost of MAM by allowing immediate cancellation of builds that include defective parts.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a structured light monitoring system (SLMS) for metal additive manufacturing (MAM). SLMS uses a projector and a camera to quickly measure the three-dimensional height of multiple features of a part during its fabrication in MAM settings. Dimensional results from the SLMS are compared against values predefined by technicians to determine if the part is within defect tolerance. A patented measurement model is included to gauge the uncertainty of each measurement point to further bolster the statistical part health monitoring method. Initial results show that the SLMS is capable of resolving porosity defects as small as 25 microns, and powder deposition defects as small as 80 microns.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
