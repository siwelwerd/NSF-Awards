 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of shape memory alloy actuators through 3D printing that may compete with the force capabilities of traditional hydraulic actuators. An actuator is a component of a machine that is responsible for controlling a system.  A typical commercial aircraft has several independent hydraulic systems and one or two pumps to pressurize the systems. These systems are used to control the flight surfaces that control the movement of the aircraft in the air. These systems add a great deal of weight to the aircraft. In the development of vehicles for the aerospace industry, space and weight are always of great concern. This technology has the potential to reduce the weight and footprint of actuators used in aircraft by eliminating the need for hydraulic systems. This project has a potential added benefit of also reducing the fire risk for aircraft experiencing an emergency in the air or during landing. Finally, this technology has the potential to aid satellite and rocket manufacturing industries with similar motivations for adoption.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of additive manufacturing strategies for shape memory alloys. Shape memory alloys are a class of materials that allow the materials to be formed into a desired shape, which is called the parent shape. This parent shape can then be deformed and upon the application of heat above a certain threshold, the material will revert to its parent shape exhibiting a \u201cshape memory.\u201d Nickle and titanium are readily alloyed to produce shape memory alloy actuators. However, traditional machining of nickel titanium alloys are challenging due to their high hardness and the fact that the heat generated during machining has the potential to change the properties of the material. The use of additive manufacturing using a high-powered laser to melt powdered metals is used to address the difficulties associated with traditional machining. The use of specific printing strategies has been developed to modify the threshold temperature of the actuator during printing and thus, enable the material properties to be tailored.  This tailoring allows the development of actuators customized to the customers\u2019 specific needa.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
