 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Saint Mary\u2019s College of California, a Hispanic-serving Institution, for the acquisition of a laser confocal microscope to be used for research and research training of a diverse population of undergraduates. The acquisition of this microscope will allow faculty to train the next generation of scientists in the use of this imaging technology through academic course work and course-based research experiences in both introductory Biology courses and upper division courses in Cell Biology, Developmental Biology and Microbiology courses. This instrument will also help advance research programs of faculty who normally mentor multiple undergraduate students, thereby providing valuable research, publication and presentation opportunities for students and helping them to prepare the students for graduate programs and careers in STEM. In addition, this instrument will be incorporated into microscopy workshops for middle school students and community outreach to nearby high-need high schools and local community colleges.\r\n\r\nThe confocal microscope will impact a broad range of research projects including dendritic growth regulation in sympathetic neurons; the cellular interactions in predatory bacteria; the function of various polymorphisms in endogenous retroviruses; the role of Rho-GTPases and signaling pathways in the establishment and maintenance of adherens junctions; the role of histone methyltransferases in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; the genetic links between gamete and embryo development; effects of environmental toxins on embryo and germ cell development; factors affecting reproductive lifespan; and identifying unculturable microorganisms present on skin and environmental surfaces. In addition, this microscope will allow the faculty to pursue novel avenues of research that were previously difficult to pursue at Saint Mary\u2019s College. Furthermore, the availability of this instrument will allow faculty and student researchers to address impactful research questions, bring their research to fruition sooner and disseminate their work to the scientific community through conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
