 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, there has been interest in the potential of offshore distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) in the Pacific Northwest and a test in this region would be of widespread interest to the oceanographic community. DAS is a relatively new observational technique in academia that interrogates an optical fiber with repeated laser pulses and utilizes changes in the phase of backscattered light to measure the strain rate along the fiber. DAS can work to distances of up to ~100 km, has a spatial resolution of a few meters and a broad frequency sensitivity. There is still a lot to be learned about how the DAS signal responds to strain. On land, DAS has been demonstrated for a wide variety of applications including earthquake monitoring and rapid response aftershock studies etc. DAS experiments in the ocean are more challenging. It wasn\u2019t until 2019 that the potential of seafloor DAS for academic research was demonstrated. The Oregon margin is one of the most energetic coastlines in the world and an excellent location to test the DAS capabilities and is thus, an ideal site to study the role of storms in generating seismic noise near coastlines and potentially understanding if and how DAS could be used for measuring sediment exchange. DAS has also been identified as a new technology that might form an important component of future offshore earthquake and tsunami early warning systems in Cascadia and elsewhere. The scheduled shutdown provides a great opportunity to test DAS in this region. A Caltech graduate student will get experience leading data acquisition and two UW graduate students will gain experience in DAS/DTS data acquisition. \r\n\r\nThe PIs are taking advantage of a rare scheduled shutdown in early November 2021 of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Regional Cabled Array (RCA). With the RCA cables disconnected from all RCA shoreside equipment, the distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) and distributed temperature sensing (DTS) systems will be connected to the OOI fibers and will undergo testing to determine the potential of submarine DAS to observe seismic, oceanographic, acoustic and geodetic processes. DAS is potentially of great importance for efforts to develop offshore earthquake and tsunami warning systems in Cascadia and this experiment represents an important step in developing protocols that can support the use of DAS for science and hazards mitigation in the Northeast Pacific while meeting national security requirements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Small changes in the timing of back scattered light are used to measure changes in strain along the fiber.The method can work to distances approaching 100 miles and has a spatial resolution of a tens of feet and a broad frequency sensitivity.A DAS fiber optic cable thus, behaves similarly to a long line of very closely spaced broadband seismometers.In the oceans, DAS on submarine telecommunication cables has scientific potential for recording earthquakes, imaging the structure of the Earth, measuring ocean waves and currents, and studying ocean acoustic signals.It may also provide an effective means to support offshore monitoring for earthquake and tsunami early warning.This award supported a short experiment to test DAS on the cables of the NSF Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array.This NSF facility operates two submarine cables that extend offshore Pacific City, Oregon, and connect to networks of multidisciplinary sensors on the Oregon margin off Newport, Oregon, and on Axial Seamount which is a volcano 300 miles offshore.During a 4-day maintenance shutdown of this observatory, we installed three DAS interrogators in the Pacific City Shore station and collected data on the submarine cables extending up to 60 miles offshore.We also tested a related technology called distributed temperature sensing.The DAS data set, which is about 25 Terabytes large, is publicly available and is being used to support a range of studies on topics including ocean waves and currents, imaging of the subseafloor, and acoustic studies of signals from earthquakes, ships and baleen whales.As one example, the experiment recorded tens of thousands of calls from fin whales and the DAS recordings can be used both to track the whales to study their behavior and to investigate how the sensitivity of DAS depends on the location of an acoustic source relative to a cable and the characteristics of the cable.At the time of this experiment in late 2021, DAS data could only be routinely collected on dark fibers, but emerging technologies will allow future experiments on these cables when the fibers are in use for the observatory.This short experiment represents a necessary precursor for long term efforts to operate DAS permanently on the Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: WilliamSWilcock\n"
