 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project would develop and validate a method for genomic analyses of individual extracellular elements in the ocean utilizing a technique call environment micro-compartment genomics (EMCG). Extracellular genetic elements play major roles in marine microbiology and ecology. If successful, this technique will become a part of the services available to the global research community through the Bigelow Laboratory Single Cell Genomics Center (SCGC), ensuring the sustainable continuation of this technology investment. This project will also contribute to workforce development, by supporting the recruitment and training of a research associate, an undergraduate student and courses for students and scientists on Microbial Single Cell Genomics Bioinformatics and Aquatic Flow Cytometry.\r\n\r\nThe PIs propose to develop and validate a robust, quantitative method for genomic analyses of individual extracellular elements in the ocean utilizing a microcapsule technique which we call environment micro-compartment genomics (EMCG). Extracellular genetic elements play major roles in marine microbiology and ecology. The influence of each type of extracellular DNA particle on marine ecosystems is not equal and remains poorly constrained. Currently, there is no established method to link quantitative observations of the extracellular DNA with their genetic content.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
