 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acid mine drainage is globally among the most widespread and expensive forms of pollution.\r\nThis project will investigate how to use sunlight and natural microbial communities to provide\r\ncost-effective remediation of pollution caused by mining (acid mine drainage), thus improving\r\naccess to clean water for humans and the ecosystems that support them. In addition, the\r\nproject will contribute more broadly to the development of methods and new understanding of\r\nhow microbial populations interact with minerals, organic compounds, and other microbial\r\npopulations in the environment. This understanding is crucial in order to harness the enormous\r\nbiotechnological potential of microbial systems that can be engineered to provide essential\r\nservices to human societies. The proposed work will improve environmental health, increase\r\ndiversity in the STEM pipeline, and strengthen international scientific collaborations. Women\r\nand underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students will be recruited to work on this\r\nproject. This project will promote collaboration between U.S. and international researchers by\r\nbuilding on long-term relationships between the Spanish Geological Survey (IGME) and Penn\r\nState, such that participants will benefit from international science and engineering training.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to identify strategies to stimulate sulfide production in acidic pit lakes.\r\nAs a model system, we selected the anoxic deep layer of Cueva de la Mora (CM), a permanently\r\nstratified acidic pit lake in SW Spain that is among the most intensively studied in the world.\r\nTwo competing hypotheses emerged from our previous research: 1) Sulfide production is\r\nlimited by organic carbon, or 2) Sulfide production is limited by zero-valent sulfur. The project\r\nobjectives are to: A) Stimulate autotrophic and heterotrophic sulfide production in laboratory\r\nincubations inoculated with the CM anoxic layer microbial community; B) Resolve the metabolic\r\npotentials and activities of the active populations in the stimulated communities; and C)\r\nIdentify interactions between microbial populations cycling C, S, Fe, N, and P under sulfide producing\r\nconditions. Tasks to address these aims include: 1) Conduct a field campaign to\r\ncollect large quantities of biomass from the anoxic layer of CM; 2) Conduct laboratory\r\nincubations to evaluate sulfide production under different conditions; 3) Sequence\r\nmetagenomes and metatranscriptomes to identify the most abundant and active microbial\r\npopulations; and 4) Construct conceptual species-level and community-level metabolic models\r\nto generate new hypotheses about how to increase sulfide production and therefore\r\nbioremediation potential.  This project will contribute to a fundamental and mechanistic understanding of how\r\nmicroorganisms interact to produce and consume sulfide in acidic environments, which is\r\ncrucial to mitigating the toxic effects of acid mine drainage. The results will advance knowledge\r\nof previously undescribed and novel microbial species, including details of their metabolic\r\npotentials, enzymatic machinery, and evolutionary relationships. There are currently only 1-2\r\nsulfide-producing isolates able to grow at pH<4, although the diversity of this group is probably\r\nhigher and remains undescribed. Microbial communities in nature are made up of mutually\r\ndependent populations that exchange metabolites, yet scientific studies rarely consider this\r\ncomplexity explicitly. A significant merit of this proposal is that it focuses on a natural\r\nenvironment with intermediate complexity, appropriate for expanding and adapting modeling\r\ntools developed for laboratory cultures for natural ecosystems. Documenting microbial\r\ninteractions in communities is key to understanding community assembly and to harnessing the\r\nenormous biotechnological potential of engineered microbial systems that can provide\r\nessential services to human societies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
