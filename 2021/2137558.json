 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).  In this project, funded by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and housed in the Chemistry Division, Professor Yi He and their students at the University of New Mexico (UNM) will use computational methods to study the structural and mechanical properties of PICK1, a biomolecule that plays a role in a large number of diseases, including breast cancer, schizophrenia, addiction, and addiction relapse.  Prof. He also plans broadening participation activities in which they would emphasize the utility of PICK1 as a potential drug target to treat substance use disorder as a framework for outreach.  They will involve URM students in research, develop activities that will facilitate integration of students across educational levels (including undergraduate and graduate students at UNM, which is a minority serving institution, MSI), and participate in outreach activities at regional primarily undergraduate institutions and high schools.\r\n\r\nProfessor He will computationally probe the key residues and physical interactions associated with the structural and mechanical properties of each subdomain that is directly related to the biological function of PICK1 (Protein Interacting with C Kinase-1).  Computational tools will be used to probe two key molecular domains of PICK1, PDZ and BAR.  Prof. He will also optimize the United-RESidue (UNRES) physics-based coarse-grained force field to explore the disordered linker which connects the PDZ and BAR domain.  Understanding the biological role of each subdomain will lay the foundation to explore how nature assembles signaling proteins through modular domains. These goals will ultimately be achieved by applications of advanced physics-based atomistic and coarse-grained simulations, which can now reach the relevant timescales for small proteins.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This protein is pivotal in regulating the trafficking of integral membrane proteins and is considered a potential drug target for addressing substance use disorders. Our work has successfully accomplished all proposed goals, providing significant insights into the biological functions of PICK1 subdomains and advancing computational tools and STEM education in New Mexico. All these findings led to 10 publications, including a cover article in ACS the Journal of Physical Chemistry B. This grant has also supported two graduate students who graduated in the spring of 2024. Additionally, we hosted eight Virtual Reality events both on and off the University of New Mexico campus, engaged six K-12 student groups, and participated in two local science fairs. We also designed and revised a computational experiment for the General Chemistry Lab (CHEM 1225L) and introduced computational projects in CHEM 421/521 Biochemistry/Chemical Biology I. These computational components received extremely positive feedback from both undergraduate and graduate students.</p>\n<p>In addition to the scientific and educational successes highlighted here, this NSF-LEAPS award played a crucial role in helping the PI (who was a junior faculty member when the grant was awarded and had just received tenure at the time of filing the final report) establish a research program and build a research group. The NSF-LEAPS support was a life-saver for junior faculty in a small department with minimal resources. Without the NSF LEAPS award, the PI would not have been able to pursue an NSF CAREER award.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Objectives and Achievements</strong></p>\n<p>The research focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying the allosteric regulation and structural dynamics of the PICK1 protein, which is significant for its role in cellular processes. Through simulations, the study explored how different ligands influence the PICK1 PDZ domain's dynamics, uncovering unique allosteric patterns that are crucial for designing inhibitors. Additionally, the research optimized the UNRES coarse-grained force field to better characterize the structural ensemble of the PICK1 linker, revealing key residues and interactions that dictate its conformational states. Furthermore, pulling simulations identified residues that determine the curvature and rigidity of the PICK1 BAR dimer, offering insights into its mechanical properties and laying the groundwork for future engineering applications. These findings contribute valuable knowledge to the field of structural biology and provide tools for advancing therapeutic strategies targeting PICK1.</p>\n<p><strong>Educational Objectives and Achievements</strong></p>\n<p>The recent integration of cutting-edge computational research findings into our undergraduate and graduate courses has greatly enhanced the curriculum, equipping students with advanced knowledge that is vital for careers in STEM fields.

The innovative use of Virtual Reality (VR) to simulate computational research has made complex scientific concepts more accessible, fostering interest in STEM careers among underrepresented communities.
