 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical summary\r\n\r\nWith this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, principal investigator (PI) Prof. Efrain Rodriguez and his research group at the University of Maryland will develop new types of quantum materials consisting of elements such as iron, cobalt, and nickel that are sandwiched between thin layers of other elements such as sulfur. The concept of developing new types of electronic materials that possess unique quantum properties can enable the revolution in quantum information long sought after by many scientists.  A unique aspect of the work is that the incorporation of metal sulfide layers invokes other physical properties such as magnetism that are enticing for quantum information applications. These layers, however, do not randomly stack on top of one another and instead molecules are inserted that guide the stacking sequence. Chemical control at the atomic level therefore allows these molecules to \u2018twist\u2019 or \u2018bend\u2019 the metal sulfide layers into producing attractive properties for quantum technologies. This precise control at the atomic scale allows the design of novel quantum materials.  These research activities also include outreach to the local community around College Park in education through the use of 3D printers. The PI and his students have taken close to 50 different molecules and materials from chemical databases and turned them into 3D printed structures. Their model kits called MolecularCraft serve as instructional tools in the chemistry classroom in local high schools. The PI collaborates with the faculty at the nearby International High School at Langley Park (IHSLP), which is a school that serves students underrepresented in STEM. The PI and students from the University of Maryland propose to engage with IHSLP students using their local 3D printers but also resources on the university campus. The aim is to teach the students about materials that make technologies possible and to inspire them to consider STEM careers.\r\n\r\nTechnical summary\r\n\r\nThis project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, will examine how two or more disparate components can be formed to create new types of hybrid materials which can open new avenues towards emergent phenomena. In the proposed research activities, hybrid materials consist of metal-amine complexes inserted into two-dimensional (2D) metal chalcogenides. The metal-amine molecular units are chiral and serve as structure directing agents to form crystal structures that break inversion symmetry. The research activities also investigate how much hydrogen bonding between the \u2013NH2 groups of the metal amine complexes and the terminal Q2- anions (Q = S and Se) of the metal chalcogenides dictates crystal structure. To give rise to non-centrosymmetric quantum materials, such interactions should either twist or bend the 2D layers. The crystal growth of non-centrosymmetric quantum materials takes place under solvothermal conditions. The solvent for crystal growth is an amine bidendate ligand L that forms [ML3]n+ complexes, where M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, or Cu.  The hosting MQ layers are classified as tetrahedral transition metal chalcogenides (TTMCs), which in contrast to the well-studied transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g. MoS2, WTe2), have a square metal sublattice and accommodate smaller transition metals of the first row. The targeted phases include Fe- and Ni-based TTMCs for non-centrosymmetric superconductivity and Co- and Mn-based TTMCs for \u2018ferroelectric\u2019 itinerant magnetism. Outreach to the local school, IHSLP, uses 3D printing to teach students about inorganic molecules and inorganic materials. Students learn about structure-property relationships and about materials that play important roles in technology such as rechargeable batteries, solar cells, and superconductors. The 3D printing MolecularCraft kits start with Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, to teach students the basics of structure. IHSLP also has 3D printing capabilities, and the PI has a webpage where all the 3D printing files are currently hosted. Representation matters too, so another goal includes demonstrating to the students a more diverse representation in the sciences. The 3D printing project serves as a bridge to connect them with information on the pathways to different STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These are also materials that will enable the next generation of computing beyond conventional silicon-based electronics. Today, most quantum materials consist of superconductors, topological materials, and some exotic phases such as quantum spin liquids. This project focused on superconductors, which display the amazing property of conducting electric currents with zero resistive losses. In addition, they can also expel all magnetic field lines in what is known as the Meissner effect. This project focused on two-dimensional (2D) superconductors and twisting or bending such layers as to break a special type of symmetry known as inversion symmetry. Such breaking of symmetry can lead to new exotic phenomena in superconductors or new types of superconductivity. The research activities included the synthesis of these 2D quantum materials and the insertion of molecular species in between the 2D layers through a process known as intercalation.</p>\n<p>Intellectual merits: When inorganic components in a material are combined with organic units, then they are termed hybrid materials. Here, the research activities consisted in preparing such hybrid quantum materials through hydrothermal and solvothermal methods. The PI and his students successfully formed such materials where the inorganic 2D layers consisted of metal sulfides and selenides. The first set were iron sulfide (FeS) and iron selenide (FeSe), and the organic intercalated units consisted of amine molecules and amine-based molecular cationic units such as [Fe(en)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> where en = ethylenediamine. Other amine molecules were also found to work such as 1,2-diaminohexane and 1,3-diaminopropane. The PI&rsquo;s students also experimented with other metal chalcogenides such as those of cobalt, niobium, and tantalum. While some materials were found to be superconducting, others were found to be either normal metals or ferromagnetic metals. Interestingly, the project found a novel polar ferromagnetic metal through the intercalation of amine into cobalt selenide (CoSe). The project also uncovered, through hydrothermal synthesis, so-called mismatched layered materials through the insertion of a metal hydroxide layer into the FeS and FeSe layers. Such materials are inspired by naturally occurring minerals known as tochilinite. While not superconducting, these artificial tochilinite show promise to potentially boost the critical temperature of iron-based superconductors. From a chemical synthesis perspective, it was also found that the most successful intercalants are those that contain amino groups of the gype --NH2. This is justified on the basis that hydrogen bonding of the type N--H...Q where Q = S or Se is very effective in these hybrid materials. Overall, the project suggests many new different directions to take this project, including the intercalation of chiral amines such as methylbenzylamine or even amino acids into layered transition metal dichalcogenide to make chiral superconductors, which may exhibit nonconventional pairing mechanisms for the electrons..</p>\n<p>Broader impacts: One of the major activities for the PI to broaden the impact of this work is to organize and host a winter school every January. This school is known as Fundamental of Quantum Materials (FQM) and it is co-organized with two of his colleagues in the Department of Physics and the Maryland Quantum Materials Center. During FQM, approximately 35 to 40 students participate in pedagogical lectures focused on crystal growth and materials synthesis with the obvious theme being quantum materials. The afternoons are spent in the laboratory learning methods such as flux growth, chemical vapor transport, and hydrothermal/solvothermal. In addition to FQM, the PI started a local chapter of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) at UMD.
