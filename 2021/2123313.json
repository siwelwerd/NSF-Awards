 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together six partnering institutions to advance Data Science education in the Inland Empire, one of the most populous and diverse regions in California and the nation. The partnership includes the University of California Riverside, California State University San Bernardino, the three community colleges of the Riverside Community College District, and San Bernardino Valley College. All six partners are Hispanic Serving Institutions. The objective is develop and deploy \u2018The Data Science Career Pathways in the Inland Empire\u2019 (DS-PATH), a DSC program that aims to: (i) create flexible pathways for Data Science education in the Inland Empire region of Southern California, (ii) provide students with experiential learning opportunities, (iii) develop a community of partners that will provide local, tangible, and impactful Data Science projects, and (iv) broaden participation of females and under-represented minorities in Data Science. \r\n\r\nThe team of diverse PIs and co-PIs puts forward a program centered around more flexible educational pathways, along with course alignments, articulations, and shared experiential learning opportunities. DS-PATH will create a pipeline that starts with outreach opportunities at the high-school level, continues\r\nwith undergraduate experiences and innovative bridge pathways from other majors, and culminates in professional Master\u2019s degrees. Bridging these together is a Summer Fellowship program that will train 120 student participants at all levels. These pathways and the long-lasting relationships developed with local industry and community partners will continue to offer workforce development, educational advancement, and project-based learning opportunities not only for DS-PATH fellows but for all future aspiring Data Scientists in the region. Moreover, a workshop focused on Data Science pedagogy will\r\noffer best and inclusive teaching strategies to Inland Empire teachers/faculty.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Upon completion of this project, RCCD has a Data Science Associate Degree, Data Analytics certificate, 24 fellows who completed 3 summer sessions and more than 71 students in the Data Science program across 3 RCCD colleges. This project has helped build student and community interests in Data Science through outreach events, fellowship info-sessions, program advertisement, cross-discipline collaboration in curriculum development and review in Career Technical Education (CTE) advisory board. </span></p>\n<p><span>This project has funded RCCD faculty to build and support program needs, student direct stipends for fellowship, program marketing supplies and professional development opportunities for faculty across 3 colleges. Professional development activities allow faculty and students training, seminars, workshop, conference and educational training in Data Science. Through these events, the participating faculty and students have opportunities to up skill, network and gain insights in Data Science topics, industry practices and tools, which are valuable outcomes of the project. One faculty is able to continue her education to obtain a Master's degree in Data Science, while other faculty are able to gain Data Science skills and knowledge from credible training sources, MIT, Tableau, and Symposium on Data Science and Statistics.</span></p>\n<p>The summer fellowships over the last 3 years have been successful. There were 5 RCCD student participated in year 1, 9 students participate in year 2 and 10 students participate in year 3. Based on student feedback, the fellows have taken away valuable experiences in having industry mentors, learning practices and tools that lead to much interests in Data Science. Upon the completion of the fellowship, more than 80% of the RCCD fellows have considered further pursuing a major, minor or a master's degree in Data Science. This component of the project provides useful results showing how educational and technical training program should be further expanded and improved to help engage students and support their success in technical education. Upon the completion of the fellowship project 100% of the RCCD fellows proudly claimed that they have gained valuable knowledge and skills, technical and non-technical, that will help them develop their careers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are also important lesson learned from completing this project, such as increasing effort in marketing and outreach to implement new Data Science programs. Providing community-based learning and workshops will help demonstrate the use of Data Science in daily life and business operation. Using proper marketing medium to reach general public interests, such as digital bill-board, video and social media channels, can draw interests amongst the larger community.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, this project has strengthen partnerships across community colleges, universities and local organizations. It also allow RCCD colleges to successfully develop and implement Data Science degree and certificate to increase the workforce and support economic growth for the Inland Empire region.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/01/2024<br>\nModified by: Kasey&nbsp;Nguyen</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2123313/2123313_10762996_1727832899066_Resized_Resized_20240809_121308_1723238061063_1723238068873--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2123313/2123313_10762996_1727832899066_Resized_Resized_20240809_121308_1723238061063_1723238068873--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Summer 2024 Fellowship Group 2 RCCD\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2123313/2123313_10762996_1727832899066_Resized_Resized_20240809_121308_1723238061063_1723238068873--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Summer 2024 Fellowship Group 2 RCCD\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">RCCD group 2 in Summer 2024 fellowship</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">KNguyen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kasey&nbsp;Nguyen\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Summer 2024 Fellowship Group 2 RCCD</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2123313/2123313_10762996_1727833038573_Resized_Resized_20240809_114445_1723238065603_1723238069360--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2123313/2123313_10762996_1727833038573_Resized_Resized_20240809_114445_1723238065603_1723238069360--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Summer 2024 DS fellowship Group 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2123313/2123313_10762996_1727833038573_Resized_Resized_20240809_114445_1723238065603_1723238069360--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Summer 2024 DS fellowship Group 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">RCCD students -
