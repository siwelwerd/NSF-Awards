 "awd_abstract_narration": "Underrepresented students face barriers in accessing and finding success in computer science (CS). Black, Hispanic, and low-income populations have less access to CS and encounter cues that the field that it is not for them. In addition, girls face social barriers to a male-dominated field.  To alleviate these barriers, the National Head Start Association (NHSA), codeSpark, a content creation company, and the RAND Corporation are creating one of the first computational thinking curricula for underrepresented populations in prekindergarten that teachers can directly apply in classrooms. This project is based on research that shows barriers to entry into computer science are complex, involving the home, school, and larger society. The research suggests that two critical avenues must be addressed to successfully close disparities in access to computer science along racial, gender, and socio-economic lines. First, exposure to computer science must start young and, second, curricula and learning tools must meet the needs and include the perspectives of underrepresented communities. This project will create a half-year computational thinking (CT) curriculum that can be implemented in prekindergarten classrooms with varying access to technology. The early development of CT skills and ongoing experiences of success with coding is likely to stimulate students\u2019 interest in the field and mitigate stereotypes that the field is exclusively for white males. Because CT is tightly interrelated with other STEM fields, this work is expected to also help increase participation among these underrepresented groups in STEM more broadly and provide valuable cognitive skills for those who elect not to pursue STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) and project are to create: (1) a prekindergarten computational thinking digital app and companion physical manipulatives; (2) a scalable professional development for teachers; (3) and a set of lesson plans for teachers. The program will be made available to schools and school systems free of charge. The RPP will engage in an iterative design process to achieve the goals of the project. Head Start parents and educators will provide input and feedback on versions of the curriculum program through focus groups to ensure that all aspects are culturally relevant and meet the needs of underrepresented communities and classrooms of differing resources. Think aloud activities with students will provide feedback on how students interact with the curriculum. Materials will first be tested in a small number of classrooms in a feasibility study where teachers can provide feedback and classrooms can be observed. The project will culminate in a randomized control trial pilot of the curriculum program. The RPP will provide information to the field on the successes and challenges of engaging in this work and a program that is evidence-based through rigorous efficacy research. This project is funded by the CS for All: Research and RPPs program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
