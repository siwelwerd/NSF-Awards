 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding Earth processes, such as mantle dynamics and plate tectonics, and the phenomena they produce, such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and planet-scale elemental cycling, requires sustained deployments of seafloor instruments because about 70% of Earth's surface is covered by the oceans. While data from land-based instruments can tell us much about large-scale structure and earthquake activity under the oceans, many questions related to the structure and dynamics of mid-ocean ridges, hot-spots, subduction zones, and continental margins can only be addressed by data acquired with Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBSs). Discovery is advanced by an efficient, effective means for scientists to acquire ocean-bottom seismic data.\r\n\r\nThe Ocean Bottom Seismometer Instrument Center (OBSIC) at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) provides seafloor seismographs and at-sea technical support to all U.S. investigators whose research would benefit from seafloor seismic observations. OBSIC currently operates a fleet of 144 Ocean-Bottom Seismographs (OBS).  The existing fleet of OBS, however, is mostly old, heterogeneous, expensive to maintain and operate, and inadequate to meet the current and future needs of the seismological community. This award is to meet the demand of the U.S. seismological community for a fleet of modern, uniform, high-performance, seafloor seismic instrumentation that results in higher quality data and lower experiment costs, and lower maintenance and operational costs. The award will generate a proven design for a new generation of OBS and will result in 35 broadband/wideband OBS built to this new design.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
