 "awd_abstract_narration": "HBCU-RISE: High-Performance Intelligent Data-Science Institute\r\n\r\nThe Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering program supports the development of research capability at Historically Black Colleges and Universities that offer doctoral degrees in science and engineering disciplines. Supported projects have a unifying focus in a research area supported by the National Science Foundation, a direct connection to the long-term plans of the host department, institutional strategic plan and mission, and plans for expanding institutional research capacity, as well as increasing the production of doctoral students, especially those underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. \r\n\r\nWith National Science Foundation support, Bowie State University will establish a High-Performance Intelligent Data-Science Institute, serving doctoral candidates enrolled at the Bowie State University Computer Science Doctoral program. The institute will address the growing national need for professionals and academics in the field of Computer Science. The Institute will enhance the diversity of professionals by increasing the number of under-represented minority students and women who complete graduate programs and attain a Doctorate in Computer Science. \r\n\r\nInstitute research is organized into two research projects: (1) deep learning algorithms and high-performance computing for cyber threat intelligence discovery from the darknet; and (2) human-centric situational awareness and immersive analytics for big data visualization using high performance computing. The first project deals with cyber security breaches, while the second focuses on data analysis to support machine learning and decision making. The unifying research focus of the Institute is an emphasis on intelligent data-science in high-performance computing.\r\n\r\nThis proposed project has three objectives: (1) create a new specialization in High Performance Data Analytics within the Bowie State University Computer Science Doctoral Program;  (2) increase the number of qualified applicants to the Bowie State University Doctor of Computer Science program by developing academic pathways and research opportunities in data science for Bowie State University; (3) increase the number of underrepresented minority students and women who attain a Doctorate in Computer Science. The project will enroll six doctoral candidates per year who will pursue the Specialization in High Performance Data Analytics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
