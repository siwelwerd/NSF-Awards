 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to pursue research and development that focuses on the more efficient removal of generated heat from electronic devices leading to commercialization of a new thermal management technology for power semiconductor electronics. Demand for power electronics is expected to be high and continues to grow especially in the defense, transportation, and alternative energy sectors, as well as the energy generation and distribution, hybrid/electric vehicles, and ultra-high efficiency lighting systems. There will be direct benefits of the project towards the development of new compact, lightweight, and higher reliability power electronic devices. In addition, successful completion of this project may result in an associated reduction in cost of operation, lower energy consumption, increased efficiency, and a lower carbon footprint. Finally, successful commercialization of the technology through the establishment of a start-up company or tech-transfer agreement and the training of students and a postdoctoral fellow in innovation and entrepreneurship will contribute to global leadership in power electronics for high-technology products.\r\n\r\nThe current approach to thermal management for power electronics is limited due to heat extraction from the back or substrate side of the device using heat spreader/interface materials of poor thermal conductivity. This project addresses this technological problem by commercializing a novel diamond material-based technology to extract heat directly from the top of the power electronics where heat is generated. The approach is based on using a diamond film because it is well-suited for thermal management because of its high thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. The extraction of heat directly from the top of a device can enhance efficiency by 40% and reduce package size and weight.  The extraction of heat from the top also offers higher efficiency and reduced operating costs, while increasing device lifetimes and density. Another objective of the project is to train the work force in technology commercialization and entrepreneurship through NSF\u2019s I-Corps Team Training in which the faculty (technical lead), a mentor and an entrepreneur lead (post doc and/or student) working on the project are taken through intensive training on how  to successfully commercialize this promising technology. The new technology may lead to more efficient power electronics, lower operating costs, enhanced device lifetimes and density, and successful technology commercialization and entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
