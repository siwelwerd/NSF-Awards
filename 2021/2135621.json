 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary research project will examine how large-scale cooperation is maintained de-spite the negative impacts that inequitable outcomes have on cooperation.  This project will bring together researchers with experience in behavioral and experimental economics and psychology, biological anthropology, collective animal behavior, and evolutionary biology and ecology to enhance understanding of the interplay between inequity and cooperation in large-scale cooperation in human and closely related societies.  The project will bridge the traditional boundaries of these disciplines by bringing a stronger focus on behavioral mechanisms to questions traditionally asked by biological anthropologists and by calling the attention of behavioral economists to the importance of ecological and evolutionary context in studies of decision making.  The project will provide an exciting education and training opportunity for a post-doctoral researcher and for a number of undergraduate students.  The investigators also will work with Untamed Science, a scientist-run company that makes online media content for teachers and students, to develop materials that can share information about the project with a broad range of K-12 students.\r\n\r\nHumans routinely participate in interactions in which one individual receives more than another, such as when one individual is paid more than another for completing the same job.  People tend to react negatively in such situations, with detrimental consequences for their relationship with their partner.  How are high levels of cooperation maintained in human societies, given that our aversion to \"unfair\" outcomes can impede joint action?  On the one hand, responding negatively to inequity likely provides an individual advantage.  Over the long term, people who respond to such disparities by finding new cooperation partners do relatively better than those that do not.  But being too sensitive to such disparities may impede large-scale cooperation at the group level.  Given the foundational role of cooperation in human society, understanding how responses to inequity shape decision-making in the context of cooperation is particularly important.  Prior research on this topic usually has focused on the interactions between two individuals divorced from their larger social context, so it has not been possible to investigate how these pair-wise interactions shape patterns of group-level behavior.  Ethical considerations, privacy concerns, and logistical limitations also have made it difficult to envision conducting the necessary experiments in human social groups.  To overcome these obstacles, this project will consist of experiments that study capuchin monkeys (Cebus paella) as a model system for investigating how social context shapes the expression of inequity aversion and the achievement of collective goals in both captive and naturally occurring social groups.  Capuchin monkeys provide valuable and appropriate insights because they have extraordinarily large brain-to-body and neocortex-to-body ratios, they are highly cooperative in a variety of different contexts, and they share humans' aversion to inequitable outcomes.  The experiments conducted as part of this project investigate how social context shapes the expression of inequity aversion in both socially and ecologically relevant contexts, and they will test how a predisposition to respond negatively to \"unfair\" outcomes impacts collective behavior.  The experiments will employ novel experimental feeders that remove any influence from human experimenters in order to study individual and group behavior in the complex environment of intact social groups.  This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLarge scale cooperation is fundamental to many human and animal societies, but such cooperation can easily break down in the presence of inequality, with negative impacts on both individuals and society.  Although we know that this is the case, research understanding exactly how inequality impacts cooperation - which is essential to understanding how to support and promote cooperation - has been hampered by the lack of studies that look at the behavior of the entire group, rather than focusing on specific individuals or dyads.  This is important as we know that social contexts, such as dominance and relationships, can strongly impact how individuals behave, so what we see in dyads might not translate to the larger group.  Unfortunately, however, large scale, repeated experimental studies with humans are ethically and practically challenging.  To address this, we are exploring the impact of inequality on decision-making in capuchin monkeys, who are an excellent model system for studying humans because they show many of the same sorts of cooperative behaviors as humans and because we know so much about the mechanisms of cooperation in dyadic groups of capuchins, but for whom group level studies are far more feasible. \n\nTo do so, we developed PIT-tag controlled experimental feeders that could be deployed both in the lab in our group housed capuchins and in the field in Argentina to conduct these experiments within the context of the complex environment of natural, intact primate social groups.  We first designed and built feeders that allow monkeys to feed themselves and for us to control, without an experimenter being present, who gets which food.  We know from previous work that capuchin monkeys respond negatively to situations in which a social partner receives a better reward in dyadic contexts in which an experimenter is giving the rewards, but this allows us to explore whether the same remains true when they are interacting naturally in a more complex social environments with typical social dynamics.  This also opens the door to exploring more complex questions, such as how monkeys make decisions about whether to cooperate when rewards differ among them or how the group makes decisions about where to forage when different members' interests differ.  These results are helpful for understanding how the broader social context shapes decision making in a socially complex, highly cooperative primate species and will inform our understanding of the evolution of cooperation in humans as well.\n\nOur research has also provided many opportunities for training and outreach.  Considering the former, at Georgia State University, we have trained six graduate students, four undergraduates, one research assistant, and one postdoc, at Sacramento State, we have trained one graduate student and one undergraduate student, and at the Iguazu, Argentina field site, we have trained nine field assistants, including six Latin American undergraduate students.  Of these, we have provided financial support to all of the GSU undergraduates, both Sacramento State students, and the Iguazu field assistants, which is critical in providing the research experience that is essential if they are to pursue graduate school or paid research assistant positions in the future.  Unfortunately, most entry level research experiences are volunteer, which precludes participation by those who cannot afford to donate their time and, often, pay their own way to the field site, so by offering funding we have provided these students with essential career development opportunities.  In addition, both GSU and Sacramento State are federally recognized minority serving institutions and many of our students have gone on to graduate school or other careers in STEM.  Co-PIs Scarry and Benitez (both female, one Latina) were both postdoctoral fellows at the beginning of this grant and are now both tenure-track Assistant Professors of Anthropology (Sacramento State and Emory University).  One of the graduate students on the project has graduated and is also a postdoc in psychology in the Emory University FIRST program and several others have received independent funding, including an NSF DDIG.  Finally, we have had the opportunity to present these findings to members of the public through participation in a variety of outreach activities, such as the Atlanta Science Festival, guest lectures at museums and other public events, and talks at local K-12 schools.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/16/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sarah Brosnan"
