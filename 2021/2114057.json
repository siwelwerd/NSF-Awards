 "awd_abstract_narration": "A hexacopter drone with a scanning LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) instrument is being used by the Coral Reef Research Foundation (https://coralreefpalau.org) to survey and map marine and terrestrial habitats in the Republic of Palau (Micronesia). The system measures heights of terrestrial vegetation, island ground level (land) and water depth along its flight path. The timing of laser pulse return times, while the drone flies an overlapping survey pattern, enable complete maps of land elevation (digital elevation models) and water depth (bathymetric maps) to be prepared. These are important for studies on coral reefs and other shallow marine habitats, terrestrial forests, grasslands and mangroves. They form the quantitative basis of estimating shoreline inundation from storms or rising sea levels, stability of islands, risks of tsunamis in given areas, coastal planning, forest sustainability and understanding human environmental impact in Palau. Survey results will be shared with government agencies and the public. Previously there has been no local LiDAR drone capability in Palau, although many local agencies, organizations and individuals have needed data and surveys. The system/data will also be an excellent teaching tool to supplement ongoing programs in local STEM education. \r\n\r\nThe high-resolution data, otherwise unobtainable, are impactful across a wide variety of field disciplines related to tropical marine/island environments, including bathymetric/topographic and habitat mapping, quantitative imaging for coral reefs, stability of islands, marine megafauna habitats, terrestrial ecosystems and human-influenced habitats. These are relevant to many aspects of conservation, protected area management, coastal oceanography, and dynamic elements of climate change/variation. The data sets are used to prepare mapping to provide a quantitative basis for inundation modeling, tsunami risk prediction, protected area surveys for National and State governments, coastal planning, forest sustainability and understanding the environmental impact of human history in Palau. The system is being incorporated into existing educational programs (bathymetric mapping, robotics, \"Back to Nature\" scientific field trips) to have a positive influence on local students. There previously was no research/commercial drone/aircraft based LiDAR capability in Palau, hence the requested equipment represents a singular capability for Palau with many local users (agencies and organizations) needing data and surveys\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The LiDAR uses a scanning green laser to determine both terrestrial elevations and aquatic depths. The instrument emits green laser pulses which hit the ground or bottom and pulses reflected back to the instrument are detected. The transit time (in and out) determine the elevation of the ground relative to the altitude of the drone, or the water depth relative to the water's surface. The LiDAR emits thousands of laser pulses per second in a left-right swath and records the returns while the drone flies slowly along a path at a set altitude (less than 100 m altitude for the EDGE system). The position of each pulse returned is calculated and recorded, and the system effectively makes a map of topography or bathymetry using thousands to millions of points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typical airborne LiDAR mapping systems are heavy with high power requirements and can only be flown by a large aircraft at great expense.&nbsp; Such systems can map hundreds of square kilometers in a few days with a resolution of 1-9 points per square meter. Instead, the self-contained EDGE system is unique in its light weight (5 kg), which can be flown just about anywhere without extensive support. When flying \"low and slow\" it achieves point densities of 100-300 points per square meter, but can also map at resolutions as high as 1,000 points per square meter. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of our initial flight days have been focused on the geomorphology of Palau's earthwork terraces, supported by a US Department of State grant (U.S. Ambassador's Fund for Cultural Preservation) entitled \"Preserving the Legacy of a Monumental Earthwork Landscape: Oral Traditions, Remote Sensing, and Community Engagement in the Republic of Palau, Micronesia\". Working with Archaeologist Dr. Jolie Liston of Palau Heritage Consulting, we are doing exceptionally accurate digital elevation models of the ancient terraced areas (1,000 - 2,500 years old) to develop educational materials for Palauan school children, inform the broader community of adults and elders about the history and extent, plus develop an educational experience for tourists in an Aimeliik State visitor's center setting (topographic models, image derived from LiDAR surveys) located in the area of the terraces.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This LiDAR will be important in providing a quantitative basis for future wave inundation modeling, tsunami risk prediction, protected area surveys for National and State governments, coastal planning, forest sustainability and understanding the environmental impact of human history in Palau.&nbsp; With the elevation and depth data collected by the LiDAR, we will prepare local detailed digital elevation and bathymetric maps that will be very useful for both scientific and educational users, including public audiences.
