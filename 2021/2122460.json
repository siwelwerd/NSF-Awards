 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will provide a comprehensive analysis of universities' dual-career policies and practices and will generate resources for increasing the representation of women and minorities in science. With more than one-third of US-based academic researchers being in personal relationships with other academics, recruitment and retention of top talent depends upon universities meeting the dual-career needs of researchers. This challenge is especially important for diversifying the scientific workforce, as prior studies have pinpointed problems with academic appointments as a major contributor to the leaky pipeline causing attrition of women and minorities in biomedical and STEM fields. The project will develop evidence-based guidance for university administrators and critical resources for dual-career researchers in order to support greater inclusion of women and minorities in scientific careers. These objectives will be met through a rigorous research project designed to produce new empirical knowledge about dual-career policies, their application, and perceptions of them.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project has three aims: (1) assess researchers' perceptions of dual-career academic job searches and the effects of university partner-hire policies upon research productivity and career advancement, (2) document the formal mechanisms used by universities to support dual career hires, and (3) establish innovative resources for the larger academic community to visualize and share information about universities' dual career policies and practices. These aims will be accomplished through a mixed-methods approach that includes a quantitative online survey of US based dualcareer academic researchers' perceptions and employment decisions at critical transition points in their careers, qualitative content analysis of the dual-career policies of all 131 R1 (\"very high research activity\") universities in the US, and the publication of an online \"scorecard\" of the dualcareer-friendly status of all R1 US universities, along with an accompanying report for university officials and academic associations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our national survey found that 37% of respondents had a partner who held an academic job at a college or university or who was either currently looking for such a position or had previously sought such a position. Moreover, 43% of respondents with an academic partner reported having lived apart because of their academic employment. This finding shows that academic employment can have major impacts on relationships and families. Indeed, 20% of respondents also reported that a prior relationship ended because of difficulty finding academic employment in the same geographic area. There were also reported effects on academic careers, with 45% of survey respondents whose partners had previously sought an academic position but were no longer looking for one reporting that their partner's decision was based on prioritizing the respondent's academic career. We also found widespread support among all respondents, even those who had never had an academic partner, for dual-career policies for hiring academic couples. For example, 70% of survey respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that \"Universities should accommodate the needs of academic couples.\"<br /><br />The project also generated novel findings about the state of dual-career supports at R1 academic institutions. Some of the notable findings were that 63% of these institutions had information suggesting that they could create faculty positions of some sort to support partner hiring. That said, only 55% of institutions with available partner-hire information--and 77% of the institutions that had processes for creating faculty positions--specified that those could be tenure-track positions. We also found differences between public and private institutions. Public institutions were much more likely to have data on whether they created faculty positions for partner hires (83% for public, 47% for private). Substantially more public universities also created faculty positions of some sort for partners (82% for public, 41% for private). Additionally, we found important regional differences. While the vast majority of universities in the West, South, and Midwest had provisions for creating some kind of faculty position for partners, that was not the case for the majority of universities in the Northeast. Specifically, just 46% of universities in the Northeast appeared to create faculty positions for partner hires compared to 86% of universities in the West, 81% in the South, and 76% in the Midwest. Finally, we found that universities that had received National Science Foundation (NSF) ADVANCE grants were much more likely to create faculty positions, facilitate non-faculty positions, and have more developed resources and programs for partners. For instance, 80% of universities that had been awarded \"Institutional Transformation\" or \"Adaptation\" ADVANCE grants created some kind of faculty position for partner hires compared to 62% of universities that had not. Additionally, 65% of universities with ADVANCE grants created tenure-track positions compared to just 44% of universities without similar funding.<br /><br />The broader impacts of this project were primarily achieved through the publication of an online \"scorecard\" of the partner-friendly status of all R1 universities in the United States [www.partnerhirescorecard.org]. To create the partner hire scorecard, our research team collected and analyzed the dual-career policies, materials, and resources of every R1 institution. We focused exclusively on documents that were publicly available on university websites, for these would be the same documents accessible to jobseekers. We ordinally ranked institutions from \"best\" to \"worst\" based on the data available, and we also categorized universities according to their stance on the creation of faculty positions for academic partners. The Partner Hire Scorecard serves as a resource for dual-career jobseekers and for administrators seeking to develop dual-career programs at their institutions.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 08/17/2024<br>\nModified by: Torin&nbsp;Monahan</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
