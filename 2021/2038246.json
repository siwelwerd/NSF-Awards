 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reducing net emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gas (GHG) is essential to any response to climate change, but may not occur fast enough to avoid significant climate impacts. Model projections of stratospheric aerosol geoengineering suggest that it could reduce some climate impacts, and thus might potentially become an additional element of a comprehensive climate change strategy. However, current knowledge is insufficient to support informed decisions. A critical question in evaluating geoengineering is what are the fundamental limits or trade-offs in how well geoengineering can manage the climate response from increased GHG? That is, what can geoengineering do, and what can it not do? Building on recent research, this project will address this essential question. The fundamental motivation for this research is to understand a potential option to reduce future climate impacts. Better information is needed both to support future decisions around deployment, and support the development of governance capacity that will be needed to make these decisions. This research will enable a more complete view of the impacts of deploying geoengineering than has previously been possible, by generating simulations that capture a more comprehensive set of deployment options rather than just one or two; and furthermore will assess the extent to which different objectives can or cannot be simultaneously met.\r\n\r\nThis project will generate a set of climate model simulations that each make different choices for which climate goals to prioritize relative to others, and use this to identify potential tradeoffs (sets of objectives that are mutually exclusive) and boundaries (which objectives are achievable and which are not). Throughout this process, the research team will engage policy and governance experts, regarding the potential range of climate goals that might motivate different actors, and on the governance implications of identified trade-offs. The full range of possible strategies has never been explored, in part because optimization over the space of available degrees of freedom \u2013 primarily latitudes and seasons of aerosol injection \u2013 is complicated by uncertainty and nonlinear interactions (from both microphysics and aerosol-heating-induced changes in stratospheric circulation), and compounded by combinatorial computational complexity. To address these challenges, the research team will combine three innovations. First, the key enabler to this research is an initial assessment on the \u201csize\u201d of the design space; how many usefully-independent degrees of freedom are there? This reduces the combinatorial problem. Second, the computational burden can be reduced by separating the simulations needed to understand the spatial- and seasonal- distribution of stratospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD), which can be short but require a complete stratosphere model, from those needed to assess the climate response to a specified aerosol distribution, which require multi-decadal simulations but not an accurate stratosphere. And third, nonlinearities and uncertainty can be managed through feedback that adjusts injection rates; this enables comparing simulations based on specified objectives rather than specified injection rates. The research team will design a suite of simulations that individually meet different objectives and collectively span the space of possible outcomes. From this, the key tool in evaluating and visualizing trade-offs is through Pareto-optimal surfaces: how do strategies and their responses change as a function of the optimization criteria. Although the simulations will be focused on understanding physical science tradeoffs, social and governance dimensions play a critical role in understanding which objectives may be most important to achieve or which strategies are simply politically infeasible, thus limiting the space in ways not revealed by climate modeling. Therefore, the research team will interface with governance experts throughout to ensure research informs policy. Simulations will also be made available to the wider international community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\r\n\n\nA possible method that would reduce some of the future impacts of climate change is to reflect a tiny part of incoming sunlight back to space; this is referred to as solar geoengineering. The best understood way that this could be done would be to add aerosols to the stratosphere (stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI). These aerosols would reflect sunlight and thus cool the climate, reducing some impacts from climate change, but it would not simply reverse the changes due to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. However, these changes depend on how it is done  particularly what latitudes or seasons that aerosols are added to the stratosphere (as well as how much cooling is done, of course). The main goal of this project has been to use climate models to better understand how different choices would affect outcomes, how a hypothetical future deployment could be optimized, and thus better understand what geoengineering can and cannot do in avoiding climate risks. This will help us understand which decisions matter, fundamental limits to how well it can compensate for climate change, and where any trade-offs might be between different objectives. All of these are essential for informing future decisions about whether and how to deploy geoengineering.\r\n\n\nWe designed and conducted a set of simulations that span a range of possible strategies that could be pursued, and consider a range of different plausible amounts of cooling; collectively these better explore the range of future options. These simulations were used to conduct optimization for different climate metrics to assess both how much the strategy depends on the metric chosen as well as how much better one might be able to achieve. These simulations have also been used already to look at various impacts, including risks from Antarctic ice melt, and effects on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation for example. Finally, we have collaborated with other climate modeling centers to conduct similar analyses, together with our simulations conducted as part of this project this has led to the design of scenarios and strategies for the next set of Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) simulations.\r\n\n\nSpecifically, for global cooling of up to 1.5C, there are approximately 6-8 independent degrees of freedom for SAI that would lead to detectably different climate outcomes. These include injection at 30N, 15N, equator, 15S, 30S (all at altitudes well above the range of existing transport aircraft), as well as spring injection at 60N and 60S, at lower altitudes. Different strategies involving different combinations of these latitudes yield different outcomes not only in surface temperature and precipitation, but on Arctic sea ice, hurricane indices, Antarctic sea ice risks, etc. The high-latitude cases (Arctic-focused or polar-focused strategies, using 60N and 60S) are of particular interest because the tropopause there is lower, allowing for injection at lower altitude, that could be conducted with existing (but modified) aircraft, making this a nearer-term option. These strategies preferentially cool at higher latitude, offsetting many critical near-term climate risks including loss of Arctic sea ice and permafrost thaw. In general, the best strategies are hemispherically-symmetric, and while a deployment might conceivably start with higher-latitudes, in the longer-term a strategy that injects equal amounts at roughly 30N and 30S (15N and 15S might do as well) is not too sub-optimal relative to more complicated strategies for many metrics (although optimizing across the available degrees of freedom can in principle do a better job of balancing changes in temperature and precipitation.\r\n\n\nFinally, all of the simulations from this research are openly available and shared with the research community, and conclusions are shared with other researchers and with policy experts to better inform discussions of governance going forward. We now have a much better understanding of what would make sense in both nearer-term and longer-term for a potential deployment; that helps with further evaluation of what the impacts of those choices would be, and what the trade-offs would be. Depending on how much worse climate impacts become, SAI may become a valuable additional tool to help manage these impacts.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/07/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DouglasGMacMartin\n"
