 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines how networks of collaborative research are challenging the way we study about soils. Contemporary understanding of soil focus on how it is a one of the most biodiverse and critical ecosystems on the planet. This project will trace how scientific practices of studying soil microbes are driving terrestrial cycles of carbon, water, phosphorous, and nitrogen. It will follow scientists as they investigate soil microbial activity in relation to climate conditions, plant pathogens, and medicinal resources for humans. The project will document how novel research techniques are helping scientists design soil microbial processes to respond to changing climate conditions and soil issues.  The project will provide insight for natural scientists, social scientists, and policymakers to better understand how specific soil science practices inform current priorities and challenges of soil health.\r\n\r\nThe central focus of this research project is the collaborative networks of soil scientists and biotech engineers. The project uses ethnographic strategies to trace the social and technical infrastructure of soil microbiology research through which scientists assemble their understanding of soils as living systems. Its analysis draws on qualitative data from interviews with scientists and participant observation in soil research settings. While human-soil interactions are often examined in agricultural contexts, this project is among the first to examine how scientists construct new meanings and materialities of soils in their research practices. Scientific explorations of soil microbiomes are contributing to mapping new frontiers of ecological knowledge. This project will study how political and cultural transformations can support new possibilities for human adaptation and survival on a rapidly changing planet.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
