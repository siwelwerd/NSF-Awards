 "awd_abstract_narration": "Event-based programming is used to construct software systems with\r\nbillions of users, including mobile apps, Web clients and servers, and\r\nInternet-of-Things devices. Despite their popularity, event-based\r\nsystems are poorly understood and prone to errors because the\r\nunderlying platform, not the program, generates and invokes\r\nevents. These difficulties have wide-ranging consequences such as\r\nlosing users' work in mobile apps, silent errors or downtime in Web\r\nservices, and unexpected Internet-of-Things device behavior. This\r\nproject is (1) making event-based systems easier to analyze, (2)\r\nconstructing an approach for extracting order between certain key events\r\nbefore the program runs, to prevent ordering errors, and (3) allowing\r\nrigorous reasoning about event-induced volatility, to prevent errors\r\nsuch as state loss and state inconsistency.  The project is\r\nintroducing students to new approaches to event-based system\r\nreliability, as well as providing researchers and software developers\r\nwith models and infrastructure for analyzing such systems. End-users\r\nare expected to benefit from more reliable event-based systems, whether mobile,\r\nbrowser/server, or Internet-of-Things.  The project is increasing the\r\nparticipation of underrepresented groups in computing via outreach,\r\nmentoring, and research involvement.\r\n\r\nEvent-based systems continue to surge in popularity.  The relative\r\nnovelty of this paradigm, coupled with essential programming\r\ndifficulties (such as non-deterministic event processing, asynchronous\r\nstate manipulation, and state destruction) complicate the construction\r\nof robust, reliable applications.  Furthermore, there is a shortage of\r\nprogram-analysis approaches and tools for this space. To address these\r\nissues, this project is introducing program-analysis foundations and\r\npractical tools such as event sensitivity, making event\r\ncreation/initiation a first-class object of program analysis, and\r\nallowing precise analysis via path-based event ordering. The project\r\nis intended to result in: static analyses that incorporate the aforementioned\r\nadvances, enabling analysis of event-based applications; as well as\r\nautomatically-constructed platform models (which address\r\ndeficiencies in current, manual/ad-hoc platform models, and are intended to be\r\nusable in other contexts, e.g., to facilitate program\r\nunderstanding). The project is targeting the Android mobile platform,\r\nJavaScript client and server programs, as well as Internet-of-Things\r\napplications. Using these tools, developers and researchers are\r\nable to gain effective insights into event-based applications\r\nfacilitating the construction of reliable applications as well as\r\nexposing incorrect behavior in existing programs; this, in turn is\r\nbenefiting event-based ecosystems' users.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
