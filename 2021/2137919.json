 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jacob J Bernal is awarded a Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and education at the University of Arizona. He will explore the synthesis and interstellar presence of carbon nanostructures (such as fullerenes and nanotubes) from shock heating of silicon carbide (SiC) circumstellar dust grains. The astronomical detection of fullerenes transformed our understanding of chemical complexity in the Interstellar Medium (ISM). Dr. Bernal is working to overcome the perception that education has historically been used as a tool of assimilation and control of Native Americans, resulting in a lasting negative perception and distrust of higher learning institutions. \r\n\r\nRecent findings, published by Bernal and collaborators, revealed that shock heating of SiC grains produced carbon nanobuds, which can subsequently close to form fullerenes. The findings also point to formation of carbon nanotubes, if SiC molecules are heated to higher temperatures and longer heating durations. These nanostructures would become the largest known molecules in the ISM, consisting entirely of reduced carbon, and destruction of these nanotubes may account for the presence of previously detected complex organic molecules. This could have implications for studies of meteoritic materials and astrobiology. He will build awareness of astronomical observatory facilities on the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation and demonstrate that STEM careers are attainable while remaining in the supportive local community structure of the Tribe.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
