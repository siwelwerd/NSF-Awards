 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unpredictable climate and persistent droughts have an adverse impact on crop yield. Intimate association of plant root systems with fungi called arbuscular mycorrhizae that naturally grow in soil can allow crops to combat drought stress. The relationship between these fungi and the host root is mutually beneficial, with the fungus delivering minerals and water to the plant, and the plant feeding the fungus with sugars and lipids. These exchanges happen within specific cells of the root and result in overall promotion of plant growth. Very little is known about how plant root cells host fungi without harm, and how this influences plant growth. Two very different and important crops, tomato and rice, will be compared to identify similarities in how they begin and control a beneficial interaction with another organism. Regulatory factors that enhance the fungal interaction to a benefit during drought will be modified by breeding. This research will generate new knowledge and methods adapted to crops. It will provide user-friendly web-accessible tools so that others may view the findings in a root map.  Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars will be trained as a team in biological and data science. They will be guided in collaboration, project organization and mentoring of others.  An introductory training program will be developed that integrates team-based data science education into authentic science experiences for students. Outreach will expose 3rd graders from diverse backgrounds to plant sciences. Educational material will be publicly disseminated. \r\n\r\nPlant production needs to increase to meet the needs of the global population. However, climate change increases the frequency and duration of water deficit that restricts plant growth and yield. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) symbioses were critical to plant migration to land and conserved pathways associated with this symbiosis have been identified. It is proposed that association of plant root systems with beneficial fungi, like AMF, can improve crop resilience to water deficit. The establishment of AMF symbiosis and the mutual exchange of water and nutrients between crop and symbiont happens within specific cells.  In this proposal, two crops that are phylogenetically distinct and critical to US agriculture, tomato and rice, will be compared to identify cell-specific responses to AMF colonization, water deficit and their interaction, and the conserved networks that promote plant growth at cellular resolution.  Technologies to capture epigenome and translatome dynamics in the subset of cells responding to distinct AMF elicitors or developing arbuscules and a high-resolution survey of AMF and water deficit interactions from the organ to the cellular level will be implemented. Cutting-edge single cell methodologies and interdisciplinary data analyses will be developed and deployed to profile this inter-kingdom response. Driver transcription factors will be modified using gene editing to facilitate mitigation of the developmental impact of water deficit and increase agricultural productivity. The project will generate user-friendly web-accessible platforms to visualize multi-kingdom cellular \u2018omic data at spatial resolution.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
