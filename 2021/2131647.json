 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large and unpredictable stressors like new diseases are impacting practically all species with increasing frequency and strength.  Understanding how species respond often relies on studies of genetics.  Islands are a good place to study such responses because a large fraction of resident species are usually impacted.  The COVID pandemic has disrupted the ability of many students \u2013 especially those from underrepresented groups -- to get the training and mentoring they need to study genetic responses to stressors. This workshop will help fix that problem by providing students from Puerto Rico and southern Florida with cutting edge skills for analyzing and interpreting genetic data that they may find challenging.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will help ensure the continued academic progress of participants from STEM underrepresented communities by engaging them in research activities that can be undertaken when most laboratory and fieldwork is limited. Workshop participants will acquire skills to analyze gene expression data from their independent research projects on response of organisms across the span of biological diversity to biotic and abiotic stressors.  A high degree of \u201chands-on\u201d virtual interaction between participants and instructors will be used as a platform. This will be followed with email and chat group communications and coupled with posted recorded sessions and associated supporting instructional materials. Results are likely to yield new insights about how organisms adapt to new environmental challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCurrent range and variety of human activity caused stressors faced by organisms have been summarized as \"1000 cuts,\" as they range from pollution, habitat destruction, emergent diseases, and disturbances from a wide variety of sources. The organismal response to stressors, and differences across individuals are increasingly studied at system level utilizing genomics.  The goal of this project is to support diversity in STEM by providing genomics training and support for the environmental stress response research activities of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and Florida International University (FIU) during the Covid-19 shutdown.   \n\nThere is a bioinformatic divide, when one compares resource rich and poor universities. This divide is even more disconcerting when one considers that some of the biologically most diverse areas have the least resources for this research.  Puerto Rico is part of 1 of 25 biodiversity hotspots, and home to the only tropical rainforest within the U.S. Under typical conditions, exchange programs, collaborations across laboratories, and off island research and training opportunities are the remedies that have been used to produce important research on subjects such as amphibian loss, honey bee health crisis, coral health and recovery, human population and environmental health. During the continuing Covid-19 lockdown period, to maintain student?s research momentum in the discovery process of stress response of organisms and increase the resilience of the nearly 100% minority students at the Biology department at UPR, we developed a workshop to facilitate the transcriptomic data analyses from student?s own research projects.  We held remote workshops hosted by UPR and FIU that resulted in multiple publications (4), and presentations (13) in national and international forums. \n\nSpecifically, one symposium, three month-long virtual workshops on transcriptomic analyses, and remote support for RNAseq research has been provided to 32 undergraduate students, 30 graduate students, 3 postdoctoral fellows, 2 teaching assistants, and 8 faculty in the minority serving University of Puerto Rico.  During the course of the project 7 projects have been completed from design to sample preparation, to data collection and analyses.  The workshops resulted in a cutting-edge independent and inclusive gene expression analysis pipeline available to all researchers at the University of Puerto Rico. \n\nIntellectual merit of the project is based on the impact on multiple student projects: effects of antibiotics on honey bees; genomic and genetic mechanisms of adaptation to stress; profile of cells undergoing mutations and exposure to hormones; gene expression during regeneration of tissues; gene expression profile of host pathogen interactions of coffee bean borer and the control agent, fungus Beauvaria bassiana.  These projects directly impact the development of ecological and evolutionary biology and genomics.  In addition, development of an accessible gene expression profile analysis pipeline provides a valuable tool to the field.\n\nBroader impacts of this project has been three-fold.  First, underrepresented students have been trained in the STEM field of genomics, evolution, and behavioral studies.  Second, in the field of evolutionary genomics this project provided a standard evaluation tool for genomic impact of stressors.  Third, The RNAseq bioinformatics training allowed undergraduates in biology and graduate students in the field of genomic responses to environmental stressors to continue to make progress in their academic training and research despite the Covid-19 lockdown. It also allowed both graduate students and faculty to add new bioinformatic skill sets to their portfolio.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/26/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shu-Ching Chen"
