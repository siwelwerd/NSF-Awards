 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. Sustainability of STEM instructional capacity gains is significantly enhanced by retaining the talent of credentialed STEM faculty. This project aligns directly with that goal. \r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused major disruptions to institutions of higher education. For tribal colleges and universities, whose core operating funds are directly aligned with student enrollment, drops in enrollment equate to loss of funding. To mitigate against detrimental pandemic-related effects on STEM instructional capacity, this award will support the salary and professional development of one full-time STEM faculty member at Bay Mills Community College. This TCUP STEM Faculty award is intended to help maintain Bay Mills Community College\u2019s STEM program as the college recovers from the deleterious impact of the pandemic.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This allowed BMCC additional unrestricted resources needed to focus efforts on COVID-19 recovery, including student recruitment and retention, faculty professional development, and additional STEM education and course development.\n\nThe funding also allowed for the purchase of The Teaching Profession, an online database designed to provide instructors with teaching resources.  The resource was so well received that the faculty development committee requested it be continued using BMCC funds.  \n\nDuring the funding period, Dr. McKenzie was allowed a limtied teaching load which provided her with the time and resources required to attend Michigan State University online to earn a GIS teaching certificate.  She then developed an Introduction to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) now offered to BMCC students from across the country.  This course is of particular interest to tribal communities, as tribal entities often have limited access to that particular skill set and the need is great.  \n\nDr. McKenzie attended the National Diversity in STEM conference, hosted by the Society of American Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science, held in Puerto Rico.
