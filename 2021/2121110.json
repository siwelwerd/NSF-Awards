 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Growing Convergence Research project addresses the critical societal need to develop a lung-independent technique for providing respiratory support to patients with respiratory failure from disorders such as COVID-19.  Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the only such technique currently available, but is an expensive and scarce resource with complications that preclude it as an option for many patients, even when it is available.  This project will develop a \u201cthird lung\u201d technology that achieves lung-independent gas exchange by circulating oxygenated perfluorocarbon (PFC, a safe, inert liquid with extraordinary gas-dissolving properties) through the abdominal cavity.  This is a convergent research project that integrates bioengineering and control theory with physiology to create a technology with the potential to save thousands of lives every year.\r\n\r\nPreliminary research results supported with an NSF EAGER award demonstrate potentially life-saving degrees of oxygenation and CO2 clearance. This project will push the research boundaries in three specific directions: (i) the development of a multi-functional fiber-optic sensor capable of measuring dissolved gas concentrations in PFC, as well as PFC temperature and pressure; (ii) the use of both benchtop and animal experiments to further characterize and model the fundamental dynamics of \u201cthird lung\u201d gas exchange; and (iii) the development of novel robust multivariable control algorithms for the \u201cthird lung\u201d, facilitating its potential implementation as a routine adjunct in the treatment of patients with respiratory failure.  This convergent research portfolio will bring together a diverse research team from the fields of biomedical engineering, sensing, automatic control, and medicine in pursuit of research with high potential societal impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
