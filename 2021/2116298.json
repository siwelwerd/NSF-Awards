 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Center for the Chemistry of Molecularly Optimized Networks (MONET) strives to create the fundamental knowledge and uncover generalizable design principles that connect the chemical structure and properties of the individual molecular components of a polymer network to the function and properties of network-based materials. Examples of network materials include automobile tires, biomedical implants and structural materials. The long-term innovation potential of this fundamental research includes cost- and time-efficient optimization of network composition and dramatic improvements in network durability for tough, longer-lived materials that reduce waste. The multi-institutional and collaborative team of researchers promotes innovation by developing open-source tools for polymer chemistry informatics, creating knowledge that addresses industrial bottlenecks, and pursuing technology transfer and intellectual property. These efforts are demonstrated by industrial partnerships, a robust patent portfolio, spin-off companies, and the adoption of newly developed data tools by industrial and academic users worldwide. MONET-supported graduate students and postdoctoral researchers access student-centered professional development opportunities in scientific leadership, informal science communication, innovation, and interdisciplinary and collaborative project management. They promote broader participation in the sciences by developing, deploying, and assessing mechanisms for low-cost, scalable, and distributed research participation. In partnership with performance artists, key concepts from MONET's research will be shared with the public through artistic performance.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Center for the Chemistry of Molecularly Optimized Networks (MONET) incorporates experts in polymer chemistry, synthetic methods, photochemistry, multi-scale modeling, and bioconjugation to develop polymer network strands and junctions that exhibit new combinations of structural activity and chemical reactivity for enhanced operational performance and improved end-of-life value. MONET's research efforts are organized into three intertwined research thrusts: Thrust 1 focuses on the chemical reactivity and conformational changes of polymer strands within a permanently fixed network structure, and how that strand chemistry is manifested in the systems-level chemical behavior of polymer networks; Thrust 2 seeks to extend the reactivity of chemically active junctions in order to understand the fundamentals of chemical reactivity in the dynamic structural environment of a polymer network, and to identify minimal chemical interventions that result in maximum network response; and Thrust 3 develops, deploys, and uses polymer data tools that serve the community and ensure that data-intensive methods can be integrated into the center\u2019s research agenda. Center members emphasize research translation through a combination of open-source tool development and the protection of intellectual property in their innovation efforts. The center trains and develops a diverse cohort of chemists that works collaboratively and leverages one another's expertise. MONET partners with performance artists to encourage interest in the physical sciences and engage the public in the challenges and the opportunities for molecularly optimized networks. MONET works to advance data use and reuse by creating and utilizing tools and databases that lower the barriers to sharing and comparing primary data.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
