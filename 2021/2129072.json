 "awd_abstract_narration": "Medical professionals learn many complex work skills. In future, \r\nartificial intelligence computer assistants will help these workers \r\naccomplish their work, and even take over some skilled tasks. When \r\nartificial intelligence aids assume skilled tasks, workers may adapt to \r\nrely on the aids, and their skills, if once learned, could atrophy. This \r\nproject is investigating how learning and use of professional skills are \r\nchanged by artificial intelligence assistants. The project is also \r\nstudying how different assistant designs might affect learning and \r\natrophy. Understanding these issues could lead to re-design of \r\nartificial intelligence aids and how they are used, with ultimate impact \r\non workplace safety, training protocols, and patient care.\r\n\r\nTo address these questions, the investigators are focusing on two \r\ncritical skills used by clinical professionals: visual search, used by radiologists\r\nexamining medical images, and spatial navigation under misaligned\r\nvisuomotor spaces, which is necessary to surgeons performing robotic\r\nlaparoscopic surgeries. For each skill, human participant experiments are\r\ndesigned to evaluate the impact of artificial intelligence assistance on \r\nskill learning, adaptation, and atrophy. The investigators are \r\ncollecting data from participants without prior experience with these skills, as they learn and use the skills, and from medical residents, as they use these skills. Different artificial intelligence designs are being tested \r\nto understand their comparative impact on these participants' perceptual and spatial \r\nnavigation skills. These skills are useful in many other work \r\ncontexts, and the findings may generalize beyond these clinical professions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
