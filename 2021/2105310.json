 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Stacie King at Indiana-University-Bloomington, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating past and present human mobility in high-elevation mountain environments. Researchers increasingly use Least-Cost Path (LCP) analyses in Geographic Information Systems-based computer software (GIS) to model how individuals move over different types of landscape terrains. However, problems arise when these analytical techniques are applied to high-elevation mountain environments because first, they derive from principles of hydrology; and second, they assume that people avoid steep slopes because of high energetic or caloric costs (Balstr\u00f8m 2002; Whitley and Hicks 2003). The intense occupation of the hilltops, ridgelines, and slopes of high-elevation mountain environments around the world both in the past and the present demonstrates that people will regularly traverse high energy-cost terrain, especially when they have to access food, water and other needed resources, and/or when travel over easier, less costly terrain (in terms of energy or calories) is/was impossible for sociopolitical reasons. Ethnographic and spatial data, combined with archaeological survey of ancient footpaths between known archaeological sites, will be used to refine LCP analyses in GIS and improve research into past and present human mobility in high-elevation mountain environments. This project will collaborate with local communities to record both individual and communal landscape narratives, creating a holistic view of how people experience high-elevation mountain environments. \r\n\r\nTo better account for the way people who live(d) in mountainous regions actually move(d) through them, a three-phase research strategy is employed that combines archival and historical research, semi-structured ethnographic interviews, and a GPS survey of the mountain trail(s) connecting a large-scale, high-elevation archaeological site and a nearby modern village where archaeological structures have previously been reported (Rickards 1910). The project will document and digitally audio-record interlocutor knowledge and experiences of the local landscape while also collecting key information such as direction, elevation, changing slope grades, and the length in time and distance using a Trimble GPS unit with sub-meter accuracy. Data from the ethnographic interviews and GPS surveys together will be analyzed with the aim of refining LCP analytical techniques and modeling when applied to high-elevation mountain environments in GIS.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Open-ended interviews take place during guided walking tours around the local terrain with volunteers recruited from nearby villages, concurrent with spatial data collection. The research goals are to document the experience of ?being-in-the-landscape? for the Indigenous people living in the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains; and improve Least-Cost Path (LCP) analyses in Geographic Information System-based programs (GIS). These improved LCP models may be used by researchers to study human settlement and movement in mountainous areas around the world, such as the Andean region or Tibet, in the past and present. The research also addresses a serious gap in mobility studies with respect to Indigenous experiences of rural/non-urban landscapes.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the project from July 2021 to June 2023, I carried out different research, educational, and training activities. For example, I successfully published an article on my NSF-funded dissertation research in the journal, Ancient Mesoamerica. I also have several manuscripts in progress that will be submitted for publication within the next six months or less. The ethnographic research and archival research are in progress while the archaeological survey was successfully completed, and the collected data will be used in planning future research questions and projects. For the training portion of the project, I have completed the majority of the coursework for the GIS professional certificate program and expect to graduate by Spring 2024. At this year?s SAA meetings, I presented some preliminary data from the GIS project in two different organized symposia. Both presentations will be published in a peer-reviewed journal (Latin American Antiquity) and edited volume for a university press, respectively.</p>\n<p>Preliminary results of the data collected so far demonstrate that analyzing how humans travel through landscapes based solely on energy or caloric expenditures is greatly limiting, as it ignores local strategies used to mitigate and/or facilitate travel in rugged, high-elevation environments. People in San Antonio plan ahead, bringing enough food with them for the duration of the journey however long it takes. When the journeys are long or the men plan to stay for more than a few days, then food and water are frequently cached along their routes or at simple lean-to shelters where they sleep overnight. While today modern packing and canning technology makes this easier today, there are many Indigenous Oaxacan cooking techniques with Prehispanic roots that were developed specifically to preserve food for long-distance travel. People also hunt and gather resources as they travel, taking advantage of any opportunities the natural environment presents. For example, there are these bulb-like plants found everywhere that a person can chew on for water once the outer skin is peeled off the skin of the bulb with a knife and you can suck on it for water. On one overnight trip, two locals from San Antonio hired by my volunteer attempted to hunt for a deer, although they were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the study on which some LCP analyses, such as the Hiker?s Formula, are based, the people I interviewed are not ?in shape? by Western standards, and most are in the 40s, 50s, or older. But over years of walking through these mountains, as well as the manual labor they do, their bodies have become conditioned to these environments. They can travel relatively quickly on the trails; they also take short breaks when necessary, especially to have a quick meal or drink water. Another assumption in LCP analyses is that people will avoid slopes that are greater than 35 degrees. However, the ethnographic data demonstrates that in creating these trails and traveling along them, people will choose the path of least resistance until they do not or simply cannot. On our trips, there were many times when an easy and gentle path would suddenly veer upwards vertically and become dangerous and people will frequently cover vertical distances of 500 to 1 km as they travel.</p>\n<p>The ethnographic data suggests that agent-based models using multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) and local topographic and environmental data is the most appropriate analytic technique for modeling movement in rugged, high-elevation environments. Full analysis of the spatial data in combination with the ethnographic and environmental data will help build these models. Archaeologists working in Oaxaca and other high-elevation, rugged environments can use these models to study movement in these landscapes.</p>\n<p>Finally, numerous archaeological and cultural features were observed during the survey and ethnographic trips. Using the archaeological survey and ethnographic data, I am developing a long-term in-depth study in the same area. The research design, goals, and activities will be developed in conversation with local communities, focusing on the questions they may have about the local history and their relationship to it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Marijke&nbsp;M&nbsp;Stoll</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2105310/2105310_10747260_1698619393098_IMG_0466_menstanding--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2105310/2105310_10747260_1698619393098_IMG_0466_menstanding--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Men standing at the end of Aguas Frias.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2105310/2105310_10747260_1698619393098_IMG_0466_menstanding--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Men standing at the end of Aguas Frias.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Men from the town of San Antonio standing at the edge of a cliff.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marijke M.
