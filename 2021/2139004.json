 "awd_abstract_narration": "Probing the physics underlying cosmic explosions is vital for understanding the makeup of the observable Universe.  Specifically, the explosions of massive stars are candidate sites for the nucleosynthesis of some heavy elements \u2013 the building blocks of structures including life on Earth.  Meanwhile, important aspects of the physics of these explosions are difficult to access via traditional approaches in nuclear astrophysics.  This is due both to a lack of adaptability of existing codes to the required mathematical framework and to computational complexity.  Moreover, important features of these explosions remain artificially hidden from the tools built to describe them.  Meanwhile, inference is an alternative methodology, related to machine learning techniques.  In the geosciences and neurobiology, inference has demonstrated success in illuminating problems akin to those noted to hinder progress within nuclear astrophysics.  The potential for inference to illuminate these problems is high, and thus this project will explore inference to bear upon them.  Innovations cultivated within one scientific arena can be transformative when applied to disjoint fields.  Integral to the research is the training of undergraduates, many with socio-economic backgrounds under-represented in science.  Students also engage in comedic science public outreach.\r\n \r\nThe physics noted as \u201cartificially hidden\u201d from traditional techniques is direction-changing backscattering in the neutrino flavor field in these high-density environments.  Neutrinos are elementary particles whose \u201cflavor\u201d dictates the manner in which they interact with other particles.  Flavor in large part sets the neutron-to-proton ratio as well as energy and entropy deposition, thereby in-part dictating the mechanism of explosion and nucleosynthesis.  Direction-changing backscattering can occur in the flavor field and significantly shape the explosion, but it presents a two-point boundary-value problem: a framework that traditional numerical integration is ill-equipped to handle.  This project investigates the ability of statistical data assimilation (SDA) to illuminate this problem.  SDA is a Bayesian inference methodology, invented for numerical weather prediction, to predict sparsely-sampled nonlinear systems.  In principle, SDA is well-suited for solving boundary-value problems, and it is expected to outperform integration in computational efficiency.  This project seeks to establish whether SDA can outperform integration in terms of 1) solving the direction-changing backscattering problem, and 2) efficiency so as to avoid sacrificing physical detail.  In preliminary results, SDA efficiently recovers solutions obtained by integration in the non-backscattering regime.  These findings call for a deep examination of SDA\u2019s ability to handle the back-scattering problem.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nUnderstanding the physics of stellar environments is critical to unraveling how the Universe evolves as a whole. The exotic environs of core-collapse supernovae (CCSN, the explosive death of a supermassive star) are candidate sites for the creation of the heavy elements, which seed life on Earth - and whose origin is unknown. In seeking a means to access these distant environs, we focus on the information contained in Earth-based measurements of neutrinos. Neutrinos are elementary particles generated in CCSN in copious numbers. Typically they interact weakly with other matter particles, but a CCSN is sufficiently dense that neutrinos profoundly impact this \"matter profile\" within the cloud of expanding gas. We ask: what signature may Earth-based neutrino observations contain about the CCSN cloud with which they interacted prior to arriving here? This cloud of matter seeds interstellar space with the products of nucleosynthesis, and neutrino \"flavor\" - a term that defines the way neutrinos interact with the cloud as they stream outward through it - profoundly influences what those seeds will be.\n\n\nIn nuclear astrophysics, the traditional approach to tackling such problems is forward integration. While powerful, this formulation renders aspects of the physics difficult to access. Inference is an alternative methodology, related to machine learning. In the geosciences and neurobiology, inference has illuminated problems akin to those noted to hinder progress within astrophysics. The potential for inference to illuminate these problems is high, and thus this project explores inference to bear upon them. Innovations cultivated within one scientific arena can be transformative when applied to disjoint fields. \n \n One difficulty with forward integration is its required knowledge of \"initial conditions\": the initial state of a system. In practice, initial conditions are poorly constrained. Thus that a priori assumption may artificially hide important physics. This is particularly true for the case of direction-changing backscattering, which neutrinos can undergo. Neutrino flavor in large part sets the neutron-to-proton ratio as well as energy and entropy deposition, thereby shaping nucleosynthesis, and backscattering can further affect the process. But backscattering creates a two-point boundary-value problem - where \"initial conditions\" are not defined. On the other hand, inference does not require known initial conditions. This project investigates the capabilities of statistical data assimilation (SDA), a Bayesian inference methodology invented for numerical weather prediction, well-suited for boundary-value problems, and expected to outperform integration in efficiency. The underlying ambition of this project is to hone SDA for application to interpreting a real galactic CCSN signal. They occur every 50-100 years in our galaxy, the last in 1987. So we are due.\n\n\nBroader Impacts are threefold. First, the research involves the training of undergraduates from a primarily-undergraduate institution, with student demographics and socio-economic backgrounds not well represented in STEM fields. Second, we extend our work with SDA to neurobiology. This will inform theory in that field, and those advances feed back to the astrophysics work. In addition, the neurobiology community is our chief means to stay abreast of new developments in SDA methodology. Third, we harness tools from storytelling and comedy to teach communication skills to young scientists.\n\n\nOutcomes:\n\nAstrophysics: In a simple model of back-scattering, SDA outperforms forward integration in that it does not require known initial conditions. Thus inference can solve a problem that is hidden from integration techniques, and one that represents an important feature of flavor evolution in CCSN (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.083012)\nAstrophysics: In a small-scale CCSN model, we can use simulations of Earth-based neutrino flavor measurements to infer whether oscillations in neutrino flavor occurred within the CCSN envelope. If they occur, such oscillations could affect nucleosynthesis. The implication for a real neutrino detection from a CCSN is that it may showwhether such behavior occurred (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.103003).\nAstrophysics: SDA is employed for the first time using real neutrino measurements from the Sun, to obtain independent estimates of solar properties (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.023013, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.043011)\nBroader Impacts: We can use measurable quantities to infer properties of biological neuronal networks, as well as features of a population model of COVID-19 (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-023-01176-x) \nBroader Impacts: Since fall 2022, PI Armstrong has led workshops in comedy and storytelling to teach communication skills to young scientists, for two demographics. One is the undergraduate population at New York Tech, with an annual performance at the Symposium for University Research and Creative Expression. The other is the astrophysics community across New York City: NY Tech, CUNY, Columbia, NYU, and the Flatiron Institute, with performances at the American Museum of Natural History.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/10/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: EveArmstrong\n"
