 "awd_abstract_narration": "History is rich with situations where the same event has been interpreted completely differently by different groups of people. Through events such as the OJ Simpson case, the COVID-19 crisis, and the murder of George Floyd, we have observed disparate reactions to events that community leaders, police departments, policymakers, and everyday citizens fail to anticipate. The purpose of this project is to begin to identify social, emotional, and linguistic markers of crises (e.g., social turmoil, natural disasters, etc.) that predict the various ways people will react to the same events. This is achieved by analyzing the language of social media, a rapidly-growing source of data from which we can understand the expression and perception of emotions at a very large scale, with far-reaching potential uses from academic research to public policy.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding emotions, the context surrounding these emotions, and subsequent behaviors are of great value to those in a crisis, seeking information about a crisis, or helping manage responses to a crisis. This project will discover mechanisms to provide comprehensive, fine-grained emotion analysis across different social platforms, and derive robust and reliable predictive models. Fine-grained emotion analysis aims to: (1) detect expressions of emotions in a text and characterize their intensity and polarity, (2) identify the triggers causing the emotions, and (3) analyze emotion deviation (i.e., the varied emotions that people express towards the same trigger). This research will contribute annotated datasets of emotions expressed on social media across distinct crises and generalizable models equipped with deep linguistic understanding for contextualized emotion analysis.  Industry and academic partners will participate by evaluating the ability of the  models to work on situations and data sources different from those used to develop the models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
