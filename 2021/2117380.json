 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optical tweezers use light to non-invasively manipulate tiny objects (typically smaller than can be seen with the naked eye) including cells, nanoparticles, and individual molecules. The ability to hold, move, and stretch microscale objects with nanometer precision while simultaneously measuring fluorescence signals enables new scientific discoveries in biology, chemistry, and engineering. The Lumicks C-Trap system is state-of-the art optical tweezer system will support advanced experiments by a variety of researchers including single-molecule manipulation, mechanical properties of proteins and lipid membranes, and the study of forces governing colloidal and polymer assemblies. The knowledge obtained from optical tweezer studies have the potential to impact applications of national interest, ranging from new therapeutics and clinical treatments for various diseases to advanced materials for energy and sustainability needs.  \r\n\r\nWidescale adoption of optical tweezers has been limited due to the difficulty in constructing and maintaining a robust optical tweezer system that can correctly measure nanoscale forces. The objective of this MRI proposal is to acquire a Lumicks C-Trap to add optical tweezer capabilities to the shared research instrumentation facility at Rice University.  The Lumicks C-Trap is a user-friendly optical tweezer instrument that combines wide-field and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to provide state-of-the-art imaging with simultaneous single-molecule manipulation. Additionally, the Lumicks C-Trap incorporates a novel microfluidic accessory that streamlines workflow and enables experiments to be performed under laminar flow in a temperature-controlled environment. Proposed experiments include tracking cellular processes, measuring protein and polymer surface interactions, probing the mechanical properties of biological membranes, and designing novel colloidal molecules. With the Lumicks C-Trap system, researchers and students will be trained to make sensitive force measurements, probe single-molecules, and manipulate materials with nanoscale precision.  Acquisition of the C-Trap will advance the growing field of soft condensed matter and biophysical research at Rice University and lead to collaborative research with institutions in the greater Houston region, including the Texas Medical Center.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
