 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will provide support for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers to attend the 2021 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on RNA Editing (July 31-Aug 1, 2021 in Ventura Beach, CA). The GRS will be held just prior to the associated Gordon Research Conference (GRC; Aug 1-6, 2021). These two meetings bring together young and established scientists from multiple disciplines who are addressing a broad range of questions about nucleic acid modifications, from mechanisms and functions to development of bioengineering tools. The GRS in particular enables a diverse group of early career scientists to discuss current research through seminars and poster sessions, exchange new ideas, technologies and resources informally, and develop their professional network. Hence this conference will facilitate training and professional development of the next generation of scientists, including underrepresented minorities, in the field of nucleotide editing. The GRS program includes a panel discussion on career choices with accomplished scientists in different professions. The GRS also serves as a career development experience for the co-chairs and organizers who are PhD students.\r\n\r\nModifications of nucleosides found in RNA and DNA have been known for many years; however, the advent of novel and sensitive analytical techniques for their detection, and new appreciation of their broad impact on fundamental biological processes, have led to a renaissance in the field. The GRS and GRC serve as a vital link for investigators around the world to share their latest, often unpublished discoveries, discuss pioneering ideas and launch new collaborations. Topics at the forefront of the field will be covered, including the evolution, structure/dynamics and mechanisms of editing and modification systems, new tools for identification of nucleic acid modifications, and engineering new nucleic acid modification systems, among others.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nIn the 2023 conference, we embarked on a  journey of discovery, innovation, and collaboration  aiming to uncover the hidden secrets of RNA editing. The focus this year was the diverse role of nucleic acid modifications: biological and technological advances in health and disease.\nIn this conference, we carefully selected talks to highlight diversity in the feild of RNA editing, and approaches being undertaken. \n\nIntellectual Merit: Our work has delved deep into the role of RNA editing, its role innate immunity, regulation and cancer . By deciphering its mechanisms, we've advanced our knowledge of how these molecular editors operate, expanding the boundaries of molecular biology.\n\nBroader Impacts: Our project's impacts extend far beyond the laboratory. Here's how our work contributes to the betterment of society:\n\n**1. Advancing Human Health. The 2023 GRS RNA Editing Conference featured two sections: \"Functions and Mechanisms of Nucleic Acid Modifications\" and \"Applications and Technological Advances of Nucleic Acid Modifications.\"\n\nThe first session explored ADAR1's an engogneous enzyme to humans, and its role in innate immunity . A noteworthy highlight included unpublished research  how we can use these natural RNA editors to boost our body's defense against tumors. The magic happens at the RNA level, without changing our DNA. By introducing specific mutations to tumor cells, we supercharge our immune system to recognize and attack these rogue cells. This could be a game-changer in the fight against various types of cancer\n\nThe second session discussed current approaches for identifying efficient guide RNAs to recruit enougenous ADAR enzymes and correct guanosine to adenosine point mutations, which account for 63% of single point mutations. These enzymes hold great potential for rectifying point mutations and restoring normal protein function. These have potential to treat neurological disorders, metabolic disorders and many more.\n\nBoth sessions presented cutting-edge research and unpublished findings that promise significant contributions to the field. Worth noting, ADAR RNA editing has garnered interest from several companies, including Korro Bio, ProQR, and Wave Life Sciences, with some progressing toward clinical trials.\n\n**2. Fostering Scientific Curiosity: The GRS event cultivated a supportive environment where graduate students could present their research and actively participate in discussions. Importantly, all discussion leaders were early career scientists. These sessions served as valuable opportunities for students to delve into various research areas, improve their communication skills, and engage in meaningful dialogues on topics ranging from research methodologies and findings to career paths and mentorship.\n\n**3. Diversity and Inclusion: We've made it a priority to create an all-inclusive environment in our project, welcoming researchers from diverse backgrounds and communities. This included diversity in topics and attendees. The conference boasted a notable representation of female attendees, accounting for 65.22% of the total participants. Among the 46 attendees, 40 were early-career students and post-doctoral fellows. Our vigorous efforts to foster diversity resulted in substantial representation from various communities at the conference. We welcomed 36 first-time attendees (including international attendees), further enriching the conference's inclusivity and diversity.\n\n**4. Resilience and Adaptability: The keynote speaker's presentation, titled \"Biomolecules Do Amazing Things But Experiments Still Fail - Learning Resilience Through Research,\" emphasized resilience in the face of negative results, highlighting persistence, innovative thinking, and serendipity in discovery. It also stressed the importance of robust mentor-mentee relationships and effective communication between graduate students and principal investigators. These life lessons go beyond science and are essential for success in any endeavor.\n\nIn summary, our journey through the world of RNA editing has been marked by discovery, collaboration, and the aspiration to make a meaningful impact. We've uncovered the inner workings of molecular editors, potentially opening doors to groundbreaking medical treatments. Moreover, our commitment to inclusivity and education has fostered a new generation of scientists ready to tackle the challenges of tomorrow.\n\nThis project was supported by the National Science Foundation, fostering scientific exploration and innovation for the benefit of society.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter Beal"
