 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study microscopic stardust grains in the laboratory to find answers to the most fundamental question of the origin of elements in the Universe and to understand the properties of the materials that formed our solar system. The results from this study promise to bring about a potentially transformative understanding of how heavy elements are created in supernovae and some lesser-known exotic stars that contributed starter materials to our solar system. The fellowship project will allow the PI to develop a long-term collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory that will enable her to establish a productive and reputable cosmochemistry laboratory that excels in a highly interdisciplinary field and contribute to the new Earth and Energy Sciences multidisciplinary PhD program at the University of Louisiana Lafayette. A successful project will enable her to obtain state-of-the-art analytical equipment at her university; thus, increasing the PI\u2019s collaborations with interdisciplinary scientists across the state of Louisiana and the world. This grant will also be used to mentor and train an underrepresented PhD student in cutting edge analytical techniques that can be used in pure research and/or numerous industrial applications; thus, contributing to the imperative effort of increasing diversity in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nStardust grains are bona fide microscopic to sub-microscopic pieces of stars that condensed in the cooling ejecta of dying stars and pre-date the formation of our solar system. The main goal of this project is to probe s-, r-, p-, and i-processes that make heavy nuclei in stars, via nucleosynthesis, by studying these signatures in stardust grains. This understanding will not only provide tighter constraints on the nucleosynthesis models of these stars but also to the thermodynamic and kinetic evolution models that aim to construct a clear picture of the chemical and physical circumstellar environments in which these stardust grains condensed. With the aid of this fellowship, the PI will gain extended access to the new, state-of-the-art, Laser Ionization of Neutrals (LION) resonant ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS) facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and collaborate with the scientist-in-charge. LION allows the PI and her graduate student to systematically measure isotopic compositions of heavy trace elements in individual micron-sized graphitic stardust grains from supernovae and grains with i-process signatures. RIMS is a powerful technique to measure heavy isotopes as it selectively ionizes elements of interest and eliminates isobaric interferences. The PI and her graduate student will spend time during the year preparing the presolar graphitic samples at the home institution and then travel to LLNL to acquire measurements on grains. In order to characterize the grains according to their stellar sources, the data obtained will be compared to astrophysical nucleosynthesis models through collaborations with theoretical astrophysicists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

About 4.6 billion years ago, our Solar System was formed from a cloud of molecular gas that contained such stardust grains from millions of stars that had died. Hence, the name \"presolar\" grains because these dust grains are older than our Solar System. As this early molecular cloud rotated and collapsed in on itself, it heated most of the gas and dust while these materials were getting incorporated into planets and other rocky bodies. Most of the stardust was lost to large planetary bodies; however, some stayed intact in very primitive bodies, such as some asteroidal and cometary bodies that escaped heating. These bodies are called primitive because they preserve early materials that contain records of what the conditions were like when our Solar System formed. Certain primitive asteroids are the parent bodies of special types of meteorites that fall to Earth, called carbonaceous chondrites. Stardust or presolar grains were first discovered (in the 80's) in carbonaceous chondrites by dissolving away 99.9 % of the rock with harsh acids, a process commonly known as \"burning the haystack to find the needle\". For more than 3 decades, these tiny pieces of stars have provided scientists astonishing insights into their parent stars and the nuclear reactions that took place in them while they were alive, before the Solar System formed. This field has burgeoned and allowed scientists to glean information on a wide range of topics from the Milky Way galaxy to the parent bodies of these grains.

Thus, these grains can be identified as presolar on the basis of large isotopic anomalies (deviations from Solar System values) measured in individual grains. For e.g., the <sup>12</sup>C/<sup>13</sup>C ratio of any material made in the Solar System ranges from 88 - 90; however, the same ratio in carbonaceous presolar grains (e.g., SiC, graphite) shows a variation of over three orders of magnitude (<sup>12</sup>C/<sup>13</sup>C ~ 2 - 7000). Natural processes in the Solar System cannot give rise to such variation and these anomalies can only be explained by nuclear reactions taking place in nature's nuclear reactors - stars! Isotopic ratios of a number of elements can be measured in individual grains using cutting edge mass spectrometry tools. Nano Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NanoSIMS) and Resonance Ion Mass Spectrometry (RIMS) are used to measure light and heavy element isotopes, respectively, in individual presolar grains.
