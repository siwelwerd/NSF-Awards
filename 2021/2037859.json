 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project based on this SBIR sensor solution, with its high quality and low cost, will enable the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) industry to accelerate the progress to greater functionality of assisted driving, ultimately reaching full autonomy. The subject focal plane array (FPAS) chips may reduce the current US 36,560 annual vehicles deaths (the leading cause of death for those 1-54 years old) as well as reduce the 4.4 million injuries requiring medical attention and the $ 871 billion in damages and health costs. Additionally, improved assisted driving will enhance the mobility of seniors/disabled. Finally, the technology may reduce the societal carbon footprint by reducing congestion as a result of more fuel-efficient acceleration and braking.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to improve the current ADAS sensor suite to increase safety. Current ADAS systems require many different sensor technologies to be implemented simultaneously. These sensors are insufficient to achieve higher levels of autonomy limiting the vehicle\u2019s used in poor conditions. The proposed sensor solution will function in low light and harsh weather conditions with high performance. The added sensor functionalities will reduce the processor bandwidth required to integrate and analyze sensor data and detect road hazards, increasing the accuracy of the system. Overall, this improvement in performance may increase the overall safety in ADAS vehicles. An evaluation system will be developed to characterize the sensor.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
