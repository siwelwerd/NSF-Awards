 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by expanding the Tribal College and University (TCU) Advanced Manufacturing Network Initiative to include four additional TCUs through the delivery of an online advanced manufacturing course series. The project is increasing access to advanced manufacturing and other STEM training for the American Indian and Alaskan Natives (AI/AN) population by developing a shared low cost model. Through coordination and existing organizational networks, all 37 of the TCU's will have access to the completed programming.\r\n\r\nThe American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) is establishing the Advanced Manufacturing Technician Education Network of nine TCUs that offer advanced manufacturing technician education through delivery of an online advanced manufacturing course series. The project provides a model for delivering career and technical education programs to multiple institutions through a distributed education model. The distributed program design brings together a team of faculty and support staff available to participate in Advanced Manufacturing curriculum development, training and education, activities, and includes implementation of an online learning platform that provides AI-curated content, access to remote data and virtual labs, and customizable for a wide range of pedagogical applications. In addition, the project proposes to employ Indigenous problem-based learning strategies in a culturally relevant model to engage, retain and aid students in successful completion of the program. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
