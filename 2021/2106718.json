 "awd_abstract_narration": "Producing sufficient food for a burgeoning world population while coping with increased climatic variability and environmental degradation is a challenge for humankind. Our global food supply chains are inter-connected, whereby problems that arise in one region have repercussions in others. The next generation of U.S. scientists and thought leaders must reach beyond national borders to find and implement effective solutions to meet the challenge of feeding the world. To help address this need, Plant Science for Global Food Security (PSGFS) initiative prepares students for globally-oriented engagements in their future careers. PSGFS is an IRES research and training program that aims to strengthen the knowledge and abilities of students to conduct plant science research with international partners that contributes to resolving global hunger. The program recruits undergraduates from Purdue University and five partner universities, of which  four are minority-serving institutions. Over three years, 24 undergraduate STEM students (8 per cohort) with academic interest in the plant sciences and international engagement spend six weeks conducting research over the summer at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) based in Los Ba\u00f1os, Philippines. During their research experience, students lead projects to evaluate a shared set of publicly-available genetic materials, master lab- and field-based techniques, and develop scientific communication skills under the mentorship of top scientists. As IRRI is home to hundreds of long-term and short-term researchers from all around the world, PSGFS participants have exciting opportunities to interact with scholars of diverse cultural and training backgrounds. \r\n\r\nPlant-based agriculture of the 21st century faces a multitude of challenges. Accordingly, crop breeders are faced with developing new varieties within these dynamic constraints. While the gene pools of wild and weedy relatives of the world\u2019s major crop species are known to harbor beneficial allelic variation, they are rarely tapped due to the weedy characteristics that accompany crosses using wild parents. In PSGFS, students evaluate a newly released genetic resource in rice: three populations of Chromosome Segment Substitution Lines developed from crosses between three wild relatives and IR64, a historically important cultivar. These lines have already eliminated most of the undesirable wild traits through many generations of backcrosses with IR64 and await systematic plant phenotyping for their potential benefits. Working in a team setting, students are cross-trained in research techniques of various STEM disciplines, such as plant genetics, pathology, physiology and entomology. Together, the 24 students over three years will assemble the first comprehensive and publicly-available dataset on these valuable new genetic resources. Through participation in this program, students (1) contribute towards scientific research for the genetic improvement of rice through hands-on technical training in a structured research experience; (2) understand the role plant science plays in the context of global food security through interactions with international researchers; and (3) establish relationships with scientists and other researchers at IRRI that extend into participation and strengthening of plant science research networks. Students will gain an appreciation of how international research is conducted, how international research networks function and the kinds of global opportunities they have before them. They will share their research experiences in their respective university communities and instill their enthusiasm to a broad range of people, thereby raising the curiosity of their peers and others in their social and academic networks. PSGFS provides benefits to society by helping to position the next generation of U.S. scientists as leaders in the global research community. \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the International Research Experiences for Students program (IRES) and the Division of Biological Infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over the past three years, PSGFS has provided hands-on international research experiences to 24 students (17 female and 7 male) recruited from Purdue University (n=6) and five partner institutions (University of Illinois [n=5], Florida A &amp;M University [n=2], University of Hawaii [n=5], Tuskegee University [n=3], and North Carolina A &amp; T University [n=3]); four of these partners were minority-serving institutions (MSIs). This initiative was carried out in collaboration with the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines where the students spent six weeks on site. Prior to international travel, students participated in a series of Zoom-based pre-orientation sessions led by the PI and co-PI. These discussed cultural, technical, and logistical aspects of the program, including modules from a structured intercultural training course organized by Purdue&rsquo;s Center for Intercultural Learning, Mentorship, Assessment and Research unit. Other pre-trip training included technical orientation: an introduction to rice population structure and genetics, an introduction to rice production systems; and finally, presentations by the students themselves on the research topics that they would be working on. Interactions with IRRI prior to departure aimed to connect student interest with IRRI research priorities.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Program Description:</strong>&nbsp;The six weeks in the Philippines consisted of two main components:</p>\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Background training:&nbsp;The first half of the program was dedicated to the \"Rice: Research to Production\" (RR2P) training course. There, PSGFS students interacted with other RR2P participants from around the world, learning about the basics of rice research and production, and gaining an appreciation for the challenges and rewards of international collaboration. The RR2P course included socio-cultural trips (e.g., to the Banaue Rice Terraces) and activities in the field, greenhouses, and labs.</p>\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hands-on research:&nbsp;During the second half of the program, students were each embedded in the laboratories of IRRI scientists. Student participants collaborated closely with their labs to evaluate a shared set of genetic materials called the Released Variety Panel. At the end of the six weeks, students present their experiences at a hybrid symposium.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong>&nbsp;The project has significantly contributed to scientific research on rice, addressing critical issues such as drought tolerance, disease resistance, and grain nutrition. Students engaged in screening a shared set of newly assembled genetic materials called the Released Variety Panel for traits such as crown root growth under drought, salinity tolerance, and rice blast resistance. Their research has resulted in valuable preliminary datasets authored by the students themselves, now publicly available (DOI: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8377501\">10.5281/zenodo.8377501</a>), which will enhance our understanding of rice genetics and its improvement.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong>&nbsp;The broader impacts of PSGFS are multifaceted. Over three years, the program has fostered international collaboration and cultural exchange between U.S. institutions and IRRI, enhancing students' intercultural competencies and global awareness. Through interactions with researchers from diverse backgrounds, students have developed professional networks that extend beyond their home institutions. Finally, the project has promoted diversity in STEM by recruiting a significant number of minority students (15 out of the total 24).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key outcomes:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Most PSGFS alumni who have graduated from their institutions are currently pursuing graduate degrees. At least one of whom is enrolled in graduate school abroad. Others have been inspired to join Peace Corps. Overall, despite having a challenging kick-off year when COVID-related restrictions were very stringent in Asia, this program has achieved its goals of advancing scientific research on rice, promoting international collaboration, and enhancing the professional and cultural competencies of U.S. undergraduate students.
