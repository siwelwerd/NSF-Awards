 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atomically thin semiconductors refer to materials that are only one or a few unit-cell thick.  They can be created by peeling off layers from van der Waals materials that consist of weakly bound two-dimensional layers or grown using chemical processes that have already been developed in the semiconductor industry. Metasurfaces refer to a class of flat optics that include engineered unit cells smaller than the wavelength of light. Integrating atomically thin materials with metasurfaces brings exciting new opportunities for quantum technology. As an example, an array of quantum emitters that generate one photon at a time can be used for enhancing community security. In this project, metasurface engineering strategies will be designed and implemented to broadcast such quantum emitters such as the signal is brighter due to quantum collective phenomena with better-controlled emission direction and efficiency. The proposed projects will provide excellent training opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students and prepare a workforce to compete globally in quantum technologies.\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\nWhen two atomically thin van der Waals layers are vertically stacked together, the atomic alignment between the layers exhibits periodical variations, leading to a new type of in-plane superlattices known as the moir\u00e9 superlattices. They represent one of the most exciting developments of photonic materials that have just emerged in the last few years. In this program, the quantum emissions from transition metal dichalcogenides moire superlattice will be enhanced using various metasurfaces, charting new territories of hybrid photonic platforms.\r\n Specific goals include (i) broadcasting an array of quantum emitters hosted in moire superlattices using nano-antennas; (ii) selective excitation of valley polarized emitters using chiral metasurfaces; (iii) realizing collective quantum emission with zero-index metasurfaces. The proposed projects explore new types of quantum photonic materials with the potential to address long-standing challenges of solid-state quantum emitters. The program will integrate undergraduate and graduate education with cutting-edge research activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
