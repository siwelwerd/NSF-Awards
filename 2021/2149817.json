 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish a new framework that connects the physics of certain two-dimensional physical systems, called conformal field theories (CFTs), with the mathematics of certain well-studied algebraic objects, called quantum groups.  Establishing such a connection will greatly advance our understanding of both subjects, and provide novel tools for studying two-dimensional CFTs. In implementing this project, new research opportunities will be created for undergraduates and early graduate students. These research opportunities will be supported by grant funding. The PI will also provide direct support for preexisting programs which seek to increase access to mathematics among women and underrepresented minorities.\r\n\r\nIn more detail, one component of the project is to find an equivalence of (ribbon tensor) categories between the representation category of the so-called triplet vertex algebra, and the representation category of small quantum SL(2). Such an equivalence was conjectured by mathematical physicists in the mid-2000\u2019s, and some explicit progress has been made towards its resolution in recent works of the PI and others. A positive resolution to this conjecture will provide the first direct link between logarithmic CFTs and quantum groups, a phenomenon which should be endemic among the most fundamental classes of logarithmic CFTs. A second component of the project is the computation of the Balmer spectrum for small quantum groups associated to arbitrary simple algebraic groups. This computation will employ and establish new links between support theory and geometric representation theory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n Background\n\n\nThe ambitions of this project lie at the intersection of representation theory and mathematical physics. Representation theory is aor possibly themodern branch of abstract algebra. It has the same fundamental flavors as ones high school studies of matrix algebra and polynomial multiplication. Over the years however, mathematicians have developed extraordinarily complex, and beautiful theories which link algebra to combinatorics (the study of structured sets) and geometry (the study of smooth spaces, a` la curved space times). The modern study of algebra, along with its many links to combinatorics and geometry, is what we call representation theory.\n\n\nOn the physical side of things, one of the most influential and effective theories in physics today is the theory of quantum fields. Quantum field theory (QFT) is a particular approach to small-scale physics in which particles and their interactions with fundamental forces are represented by disturbances in corresponding fields. Quantum field theory is able to predict certain physical phenomena to an amazing degree of accuracy, and so provides one of the most successful theories in modern physics. While a given quantum field theory generally admits no precise mathematical descriptionfor example, quantum electrodynamicswe can describe some quantum field theories in mathematical terms. Furthermore, some QFTs can be described using representation theory in particular.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, the present project pursued new connections between quantum field theory and representation theory. Of special interest are representations for so-called quantum groups. \n\n\nThe specific aims of the project were two-fold: First, we sought new connections between conformal field theory in two dimensions and the representation theory of quantum groups. Second, we sought to provide a precise geometric \"picture\" of the category of quantum group representations. This linkage between geometry and representation theory reflects certain phenomena in physics, conjecturally, though clarifying this point was outside of the scope of the project.\n\n\n Scientific outcomes (intellectual merit)\n\n\nThe PI established new relations between quantum groups and logarithmic conformal &#64257;eld theories in 2-d. These relations were previously conjectured by mathematical physicists. Specifically, with Terry Gannon we established an equivalence between representations for quantum SL(2) and Chiral representations for the so-called triplet field theory. These results significantly advanced our understanding of CFTs, tensor categories, and relations between them.\n\n\nIn joint work with Julia Pevtsova, the PI also showed that the structure of the category of small quantum group representations, in type A, is dictated precisely by the geometry of the Springer resolution. Loosely speaking, we produced a best fit picture which provides a visual rendering of the category in question. Our computation of this best fit image had been attempted by many people over the past 15 years, but almost nothing had been known before the work undertaken in the present project.\n\n\nThe impact of the latter investigations extend beyond the immediate ambitions of the project. For example, based on recent advancements in low-dimensional topology, one can apply the PIs results to produce new numerical invariants for 3-manifolds.\n\n\n Broader Impacts\n\n\nA significant portion of this project was dedicated to developing connections between mathematical physics and representation theory. These connections provide new means of doing computations in mathematical physics. Therefore, the project established new connections across disciplines.\n\n\nDuring the course of the grant, the PI supported two undergraduate research projects, and one graduate student. The PI also gave a large number of research and workshop talks, some of which were explicitly aimed at graduate or undergraduate students. In at least one instance the PI's talk was aimed at increasing participation of underrepresented minorities in graduate level mathematics.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/16/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CrisNegron\n"
