 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant, a joint endeavor of the University of Chicago, the Metropolitan Planning Council (MPC), and Brookings Institution, will fund a new set of indicators that will help people compare different neighborhoods in terms of \u201caccess poverty.\u201d \u201cAccess poverty\u201d is the idea that people who live in certain neighborhoods have a harder time getting where they need to go - for work, for school, for food, for services, and for care.  This is a complicated problem; it involves housing, businesses, public and private transportation, infrastructure, jobs and employment opportunities, and essential local services.  To build these indicators, we need to work hand-in-hand with local organizations to learn more about which assets people consider essential, how they move around their neighborhoods, and the constraints on their time and choices.  Historically, these questions have been considered primarily in terms of jobs and affordable housing; the \u201caccess poverty\u201d indicator will ask bigger questions, taking into account the full range of ways in which people need to move around their neighborhoods in order to live their fullest lives.  \r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to create a set of indicators to assess the distribution of travel burdens across residential communities within the United States. \u201cTravel burden\u201d is measured in terms of time or distance spent moving from an origin to a destination. Given the complex nature of movement within cities, the team will account for several modes of transportation as well as detailed breakouts of travel burden across asset categories such as jobs, housing, retail corridors, schools, childcare sites, health clinics, and other places where people want or need to go in order to live productive and connected lives. The research undertaken in the planning phase is to compare available methods for calculating travel burden at the neighborhood level and evaluate georeferenced points-of-interest datasets (as well as conventional employment and housing sources). There are many methodologies for measures of travel burden, these include isochrones, travel time matrices, and other spatial access techniques that use travel data and population characteristics to generate weighted travel costs. These measures can help with benchmarking, identifying specific deficits across communities, and shed light on questions of equity both within cities and across metropolitan areas at scale. This project is supported by the CIVIC Innovation Challenge program Track A. Communities and Mobility: Offering Better Mobility Options to Solve the Spatial Mismatch Between Housing Affordability and Jobs through a collaboration between NSF and the Department of Energy Vehicle Transportation Office.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Responding to this problem, an interdisciplinary team of researchers and civic professionals from the University of Chicago, the Metropolitan Planning Council (MPC), and Brookings Institution proposed an approach to create new data and tools to help civic practitioners understand the nature of spatial access gaps in their community. Activities undertaken as part of this planning grant included: 1) an in-depth technical review of available data and computational methods and 2) two meetings with over twenty civic organizations to understand the state of spatial accessibility gaps in Chicago and how data might assist their work. The resulting proposal outlines a vision for a research-centered pilot project that would increase the scientific capabilities of civic professionals through the development of spatial connectivity indicators and decision support tools that measure a community's access to jobs and affordable housing as well as essential services, assets, and amenities, serving as a 'one-stop source' to better align investments with critical unmet needs. A novel contribution of this data infrastructure proposal is its broad scope, covering all neighborhoods nationwide, and its consideration of common travel modes and non-employer destinations, such as schools, affordable healthcare, healthy food, cultural activities, and community centers, which are often excluded from spatial mismatch research. The proposed web-based tools (see attached for a visual draft), would help establish a common set of facts for evaluating spatial mismatch -- helping civic practitioners uncover new patterns, discover where gaps exist, and inform strategies to promote a more equitable distribution of the destinations that promote upward mobility. The proposal would enable scientific advancements in geography, urban planning, transportation science, sociology--and aligned fields--by allowing researchers to access nationwide data built from generalized methods that accurately reflect the nature of spatial mismatch across all Census tracts in the U.S.</span></span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/03/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Anne&nbsp;Dodge</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2043539/2043539_10712757_1628021794951_visual_mockup--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2043539/2043539_10712757_1628021794951_visual_mockup--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Example of proposed spatial access indicators\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/2043539/2043539_10712757_1628021794951_visual_mockup--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Example of proposed spatial access indicators\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This project proposes several distinct metrics to answer basic questions related to spatial mismatch and provide interactive cartographic tools to practitioners.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">University of Chicago's Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Anne&nbsp;Dodge</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Example of proposed spatial access indicators</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
