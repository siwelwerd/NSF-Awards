 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds some of the research activities of Professor Ken D. Olum at Tufts University.\r\n\r\nCosmic strings are microscopically thin or even fundamental objects of cosmological length, which may or may not exist in our universe. Detection of cosmic strings would provide a window into fundamental physics at energies beyond the reach of any accelerator. Observation of a cosmic superstring network could provide a confirmation of the correctness of string theory, which is our current best theory for unifying the physics of gravity with the physics that governs the subatomic world.  The best hope for discovering a cosmic string network is through observation of gravitational waves.  The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) has detected a signal that is likely be the first sign of a gravitational wave background formed by many sources throughout the universe.  These sources could be pairs of giant black holes in the centers of galaxies, but they could also be cosmic string loops.  Professor Olum will study the gravitational waves that would be emitted by cosmic strings and compare them with current and forthcoming NANOGrav observations.  Professor Olum will also involve graduate students in this work and thereby train future generations of research physicists --- an activity which is in the national interest.  The work will further connect studies of the universe with studies of the fundamental laws of nature.\r\n\r\nMore technically, Professor Olum will simulate the evolution of cosmic string loops under the effects of gravitational self-interaction to see how their shapes and their gravitational wave spectra change over time.  He will use a realistic population of cosmic string loops taken from his previous cosmic string network simulations.  By combining the spectra from these loops, he will generate a gravitational wave background spectrum to be expected from cosmic strings and compare it with pulsar timing observations from the NANOGrav collaboration, of which he is a member.  He will also study the velocities acquired by loops in reaction to anisotropic gravitational wave emission, the so-called \"rocket effect\", which is important for determining the degree of clustering of cosmic string loops in galaxies, and thus their potential observability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Many theories of ultra-high-energy physics predict cosmic strings, but others do not. If cosmic strings exist, most of the string is in a set of oscillating loops. These loops produce a background of gravitational waves that may be observed by interferometers such as LIGO or by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) such as North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). In fact, cosmic strings might be the source of the signal that was observed by NANOGrav and other PTAs and announced at the end of June 2023.\n\nTo see whether current and future observations of gravitational waves might come from cosmic string loops, we need to know what gravitational wave spectrum to expect. This depends on the number of loops existing in the history of the universe and also on the loop shapes. As loops oscillate and radiate gravitational waves, their shapes change. We to simulated these changes of shape and found the resulting spectra that loops emit at different stages in their lives. Then we combined the spectra to find the overall gravitational wave background spectrum today from a cosmic string network.\n\nThis work is currently being prepared for publication. In future work we will compare these spectra with the recent and perhaps the forthcoming observations of NANOGrav and other PTAs. This will allow us to see whether the observed gravitational wave background is consistent with a cosmic string network and if not to set an upper limit on the energy scale of cosmic strings.\n\nAt the moment, the gravitational wave background observations are consistent with many possible astrophysical and cosmological sources. But as observations improve, it will become possible to distinguish different sources. Then it will be important to have accurate spectra for cosmic strings and other possible sources, to tell which one we are seeing. Even if the data do not support cosmic strings, the resulting limits on string properties will provide guidance to the construction of grand unified theories of particle physics.\n\nThis grant contributed to the training of postdoctoral researchers and thus the development of a workforce for the growing field of gravitational wave astronomy.
