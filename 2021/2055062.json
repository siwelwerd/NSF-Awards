 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Washington is conducting an interdisciplinary research project that analyzes math and science teacher career pathways using longitudinal statewide data from Washington and Texas and the Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) Longitudinal Study dataset. There are three project objectives: (1) To inform evidence-based policies and practices for improving the math and science teacher workforce by studying the long-term career paths of those who leave teaching, (2) To build an infrastructure for using \u201cbig data\u201d to conduct rigorous and policy-relevant education research across two parallel statewide longitudinal data systems, and (3) establish a diverse community of scholars to carry out data-intensive research.  The investigators will implement a set of studies that explore math and science teacher career paths \u2013 tracking teachers across schools and from education into other sectors of the economy \u2013 to provide a deeper understanding of the factors that affect the development of STEM teachers.  The project will provide empirical evidence to describe K-12 teacher career pathways and attrition, including attrition resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and inform workforce policies.\r\n\r\nInvestigators will use the Roy model of occupational choice to guide the research questions and analytic approach. The model offers several predictions for the teacher labor market and competing non-teacher labor markets. The dataset used for the project will be generated using raw data provided through the University of Texas at Austin Educational Research Center and the Washington Education Research Data Center and the B&B datasets. Analyses conducted for the project will include separate but identical parallel analyses for each state.  The research questions examine (1) patterns in math and science teacher mobility along three dimensions, (2) the extent to which existing teachers earn higher salaries after leaving teaching, and (3) the relationships between salaries and perceived working conditions and teachers\u2019 career path decisions.  Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics,  mapping software to construct interactive maps in each state, and regression.  The findings will be disseminated broadly to key stakeholders including state policy makers.   \r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project leveraged two statewide longitudinal data systems, in Texas and Washington, exploring changes in educator turnover over time, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;The research supported through this project has shed new light on factors influencing the retention of K-12 math and science teachers.&nbsp;Project leaders published several policy briefs, blog posts, working papers, and peer-reviewed journal articles, with multiple manuscripts currently undergoing peer review.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">One of the primary findings from this project, highlighted in two policy briefs, indicates that educator turnover increased to unprecedented levels during the COVID-19 pandemic, both in Texas and Washington. These findings were consistent with prior work from other states, but our research offered several nuances. We highlighted that in two different state contexts, teacher turnover was relatively consistent over a two decade period prior to the pandemic, while principal turnover remained consistently higher in almost every year during this period. Recent statewide teacher salary increases in Washington likely account for relatively greater increases in teacher turnover in Texas (see&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Image 1</strong><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">).

Extensions of these analyses link employment records from outside education. We find that math and science teachers who left K-12 education during the pandemic are more likely to be employed outside education, and earn higher wages. Overall, however, the largest share of teacher and principal attrition stems from educators leaving the workforce entirely, even among early and mid-career educators. Policy efforts to strenthen math and science teacher retention thus need to consider strategies for keeping teachers in the workforce, or could examine ways to attract former teachers back to the workforce.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">In our study of teacher salary increases in Washington state (Sun et al., 2024), we found that major school finance reforms led to large teacher salary increases, which in turn caused increases in teacher retention. The effects were consistent across teacher credential area but varied both by career stage and mobility type. When examining the likelihood that teachers switch districts, salary increases had larger effects for mid-career teachers. Early career and late career teachers were not significantly more likely to switch districts in response to salary increases. In contrast, when examining the likelihood that teachers leave the profession, salary increases had larger effects for late-career teachers. The study offers important implications for how state legislators and district leaders should think about math and science teacher retention and educator retention overall, as well as the structure of compensation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In a separate study, project leaders combined these administrative datasets with survey data, partnering with RAND Corporation researchers to access the Teacher Well-being survey. This survey data is available through RAND&rsquo;s American Educator Panels,&nbsp;the only ongoing nationally representative sample of educators available in the U.S.&nbsp;We found that lower reported teacher well-being accounted for a significant proportion of the increase in teacher turnover during the COVID-19 pandemic including for math and science teachers. However, the nature varied by career stage. Difficulty coping with stress was an especially strong predictor of turnover for early-career teachers, while other factors such as frequent stress or feelings of burnout were not associated with greater turnover for this group. Conversely, among late-career teachers, reported feelings of burnout were a much stronger predictor of turnover than other factors. Findings suggest effective efforts to retain early and mid-career math and science teachers may involve strategies for coping with stressful environments, whereas retention strategies for later-career teachers may require broader approaches that address burnout.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addition to publishing the above research studies, project leaders partnered with Washington STEM, a statewide Seattle-based non-profit organization, to engage with several aspects of the project, including research dissemination. Washington STEM led the development of a series of blog posts describing several of the publications stemming from this grant. The blog posts were shared within the Washington STEM newsletter, are available on their website, and have generated a substantial amount of page views since the original posting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the project helped build linked datasets and data infrastructure that can be used in our future research, and helped establish a diverse, and dynamic community of scholars with expertise to carry out data-intensive research moving forward.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/08/2025<br>\nModified by: David&nbsp;S&nbsp;Knight</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2055062/2055062_10741232_1736330347053_Image1_Knight_etal_NSFeducatorturn--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2055062/2055062_10741232_1736330347053_Image1_Knight_etal_NSFeducatorturn--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Annual turnover rate for teachers and principals in Texas and Washington, 1995-96 to 2021-22\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2055062/2055062_10741232_1736330347053_Image1_Knight_etal_NSFeducatorturn--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Annual turnover rate for teachers and principals in Texas and Washington, 1995-96 to 2021-22\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure shows the annual turnover rate for teachers and principals in Texas and Washington, 1995-96 to 2021-22</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Knight, D.
