 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines environmental and genetic factors that influence body size and shape in humans. The project compares genetic variation, body size measurements, and environmental measurements of ancient people to advance knowledge about human adaptation and the relative roles of genetic and environmental factors affecting human morphology. The project supports a post-doctoral researcher to develop quantitative and computational research skills that are necessary to analyze these data, as well as national and international collaborations. The results of this research are used to develop museum exhibits and teaching materials that support public and K-12 science education and outreach.\r\n\r\nChanges in human body size can be assessed by measuring the skeletons of ancient individuals. However, these data reflect only the cumulative effects of both genetics and environment. Recent advances in genetic technology make it possible to sequence ancient genomes and make direct estimates of the genetic contribution to height. It is also possible to collect some information about the environment in which ancient individuals lived through methods such as stable isotope analysis. This project collates a large dataset of genetic, phenotypic and archaeological measurements and develops statistical models to combine these different types of data and identify the relative importance of different factors. By separating genetic and environmental factors it is possible to determine whether changes in body size and shape are driven by plastic developmental response to environmental change, genetic changes, or both. As well as addressing these questions about the human form, the research can provide a roadmap for integrating ancient genetic data with other anthropological measurements like markers of health and disease. Finally, data collated as part of the research are made publicly available as a resource for further studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
