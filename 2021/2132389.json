The required high pressures (similar to those at the Earth\u2019s core) present major technical challenges for practical use and applications. In this project, a new approach is proposed in which hydrogen-rich \u201cquantum\u201d materials are designed which could exhibit high-temperature superconductivity without the application of pressure. This project, supported by the NSF\u2019s Division of Materials Research, is to synthesize multi layers of a quantum material, a photosensitive material, and a hydrogen-rich material, which under the right conditions would favor high-temperature superconductivity. From an educational standpoint, this project exposes students to modern condensed matter physics, to state-of-the-art experimental and calculational tools, to materials synthesis and characterization techniques, and to the scientific research process. The research team assembled here has a long-standing interest and record of outreach activities that showcase the beauty and importance of quantum materials, superconductivity and modern solid-state physics. The PIs, two of which are Hispanics, are engaged in fostering diversity and inclusion in the technological work force and also in encouraging underrepresented groups to pursue careers in physics and STEM disciplines. From the societal standpoint, this research contributes important clues about the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity and its potential applications. A better understanding of this phenomenon may lead to materials with higher superconducting transition temperatures, which would yield important technological benefits to the nation. This would substantially improve the transference and storage of energy, create new forms of environmentally friendly transportation systems, and provide a new platform for novel computational schemes. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis project, supported by the Division of Materials Research, outlines a new approach in the search for new superconductors based on hydrogen-rich materials. Prior research has claimed the discovery of  near-room-temperature superconductivity under very high pressures in hydrogen-rich materials or at very short timescales in photo-excited quantum materials and heterostructures. This project aims to develop high-temperature superconducting heterostructures which are stable at ambient pressure by combining a quantum material (Q-material) with a material which contains a high concentration of hydrogen (H-material). This way, the Q-material contains the charge carriers and the H-material provides the coupling for superconductivity. This judiciously designed heterostructure combines the favorable properties of both ingredients and may exhibit novel properties as a whole or at the interface. In addition, to boost the superconducting properties such as the charge carrier doping, a hybrid heterostructure containing a photoconducting material subject to the appropriate electromagnetic radiation will be used. The combination of these thoroughly investigated individual materials and phenomena provide a potential path towards room temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure. From an educational standpoint, this project exposes students to many aspects of modern condensed matter physics, to state-of-the-art experimental and calculation tools, to materials synthesis and characterization techniques, and to the process of scientific research and publication. The research team assembled here has a long-standing interest and record of involvement in various outreach activities that showcase the beauty and importance of quantum materials, superconductivity and modern solid-state physics. The PIs, two of which are Hispanics, are engaged in fostering diversity and inclusion in the technological work force and also in  encouraging underrepresented groups to pursue careers in physics and STEM disciplines. From the societal standpoint, this research contributes important clues about the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity and its potential applications. A better understanding of this phenomenon will lead to materials with higher superconducting transition temperatures, which, along with other technological applications, would substantially impact the transport and storage of energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
