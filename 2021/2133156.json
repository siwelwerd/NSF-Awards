 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic carbon and water cycles are undergoing fundamental changes as the Arctic experiences an entire suite of new conditions. At the core of this restructuring is rapid Arctic warming, the loss of sea ice, shifting atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns, increasing precipitation, permafrost thaw, and enhanced melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet and other mountain glaciers and ice caps. These changes have resulted in the simultaneous freshening of the Arctic seas and humidification of the Arctic atmosphere due to more evaporation from what was previously ice-covered ocean. Concurrently, riverine discharges are driving the fertilization of the Arctic seas and increasing ocean water productivity by carrying ancient carbon and old nutrients from thawed permafrost into the fjords, bays, and ocean. It is urgent to monitor and quantify these new ice-ocean-land-atmosphere interactions to understand the magnitude and variability of carbon and water cycle changes across the Arctic. \r\n\r\nThis project capitalizes on an autumn 2021 research expedition of the USCGC Healy Icebreaker. The project will use continuous isotope fingerprinting to delineate key linkages between ice-ocean-land-atmosphere interactions along the west coast of Alaska, through the Northwest Passage and in Baffin Bay. The project will measure carbon and water isotopes of marine air and ocean water continuously with some spot intense sampling locations. These measurements will enable quantification of the geochemical patterns that record freshening, fertilization, evaporation, and productivity variations driven by differing degrees of ice-ocean-land-atmosphere interactions. These data will be the first of their kind in terms of coordination at this large scale with a transect spanning ~15 degrees of latitude and over 100 degrees of longitude in the western and central Arctic. This project will: 1) delineate the intensity of land-ice freshwater injections including the extent to which these freshwater plumes carry new sources of ancient (permafrost derived) carbon and nutrients that may drive productivity increases and ocean carbon exchange; 2) quantify the connectivity of and mechanisms controlling Arctic Ocean water evaporation and atmospheric humidification which may be altering precipitation patterns in the Arctic and in the mid-latitudes; and 3) determine ocean carbon gain or loss continuously across the Arctic seas with implications for marine food webs, support of subsistence hunting, and climate warming via atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane concentrations. This project will offer valuable contributions and data to studies of Arctic change by groups examining changing atmospheric, ocean, cryospheric processes, and marine and terrestrial ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The primary objectives were to: <strong>1)</strong> measure how the water vapor geochemistry is altered by weather, sea ice conditions and by episodic storm systems, <strong>2)</strong> identify the degree to which freshwater from Arctic rivers and from the Greenland Ice Sheet is injected into nearshore marine systems, <strong>3)</strong> examine the influence of this freshwater on marine biological production, and <strong>4)</strong> determine whether dissolved organic matter in the seawater was derived from periglacial and ancient permafrost systems under the Greenland Ice Sheet.</p>\n<p>Our most important outcomes are as follows:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;By continuously sampling water vapor for its isotopic composition above the ocean surface (~11 m) along the cruise track, we examined Arctic evaporation across a wide range of atmospheric, oceanic, and sea ice conditions. Understanding the isotopic composition of this evaporating moisture is key to determine the spatial and temporal influences of this growing source of water vapor for the Arctic atmosphere as sea ice coverage declines. A clear relationship was observed between the sea surface and air temperature difference and the deuterium excess of the boundary layer water vapor (Figure 2). This relationship can be used to identify the content of the evaporated moisture and then trace that vapor as it is transported around the Arctic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;By continuously sampling the surface (~8 m deep) ocean water from Alaska all the way through the Labrador Sea we can see specific regions where freshwater, tagged isotopically, is flowing into the Arctic seas (Figure 3). For instance, we use the distinct isotopic fingerprints to identify the sources of freshwater, including the Mackenzie River in the Beaufort Sea and glacial meltwater along several fjord areas &nbsp;of W Greenland (e.g., Uummannaq and Nuuk regions). We are also able to resolve an entire suite of surface water masses, such as the Alaska Coastal Current and the West Greenland Current, and how these water masses interact with the freshwater inputs in the respective regions (Figure 4).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Our third major finding was that freshwater injections in the near shore had differential effects on the marine biology depending upon location in the Arctic. These biological effects, ocean C sequestration (i.e., photosynthesis by phytoplankton-depicted as florescence) were generally low in the western Arctic with river water inputs as compared to the very strong biological response to freshwater injections that occurred in the central Arctic, especially along the West Coast of Greenland (Figure 5).&nbsp; These differential attributes where freshening of the Arctic is occurring are likely associated with the degree of upwelling that is quite strong along W Greenland, thus mixing deep water nutrients into the upper water column, stimulating phytoplankton growth and C fixation.
