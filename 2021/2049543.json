 "awd_abstract_narration": "The introduction of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetics testing has radically altered the landscape of birth family search. The research supported by this award will investigate the scales at which DNA testing reinforces or challenges existing frameworks of family, identity, citizenship, and belonging. Ethnographically, it focuses on the discourses, practices, and policies surrounding DTC genetic testing technologies used by adult adoptees. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, the researcher will produce a guidebook for policymakers, government officials, social workers, educators, and fellow researchers to understand the implications of genetic testing and the birth family search experience. \r\n\r\nThis doctoral dissertation research project asks how DNA testing reinforces or challenges existing frameworks of family, identity, citizenship, and the nation, focusing on a research context with a historically high concentration of adoptions and the proliferating use of DTC genetic testing technologies among those adoptees. Participant observation will be carried out with four organizations that offer genetic testing services to adoptees and birth families. DNA testing has the potential to expose trauma on individual, familial, and national scales, as well as raise significant social, legal, and moral questions. Across this network of social actors and institutions, this research asks how DNA is being imagined, constructed, and deployed to produce personal and public knowledge of identity, kinship, citizenship, belonging, and memory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For the previous three decades, adoptees had to rely almost entirely on records held by adoption agencies, often with sloppy or even fabricated records (E. Kim 2019). When adoption records offered no identifiable information, adoptees had few options besides sheer footwork, traveling to South Korea to pass out flyers and knock on doors orappearing on television to make emotional appeals (Prebin 2013, H. Kim 2016). Preliminary findings of this research show that many adoptees are now sidestepping information gatekeeping institutions (Klotz 2016), upending the birth family search process. The South Korean government has also entered the genetic testing arena, announcing in December 2019 that it would offer services enabling adoptees to submit their DNA at diplomatic missions in fourteen countries. During her fieldwork, the co-PI discovered several other DNA databases currently managed by the South Korean government to reunite the remains of fallen soldiers from the Korean War, the remains of the victims of the Jeju Uprising, and North-South Korean separated families. It is clear that the South Korean government views DNA as a tool to build its nationalist state narratives and national memory. The inclusion of adoptees to the \"ethnonation,\" however, presents a more ambiguous case than fallen soldiers or independence fighters.
