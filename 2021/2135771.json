 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 55-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum.  The Belmont Forum is a consortium of research funding organizations focused on support for transdisciplinary approaches to global environmental change challenges and opportunities.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions. This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries.  The teams will establish transdisciplinary networks to develop innovative solutions for sustainable development pathways and seek to assess the positive and negative inter-linkages between the economy, technology, institutions with the environment, climate, biodiversity, and human well-being to understand potential pathways to a sustainable world.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to establish cost-effective, efficient, and sustainable transdisciplinary processes, methods and networks to assist stakeholders, scientists, public officers and citizens of the Pacific Islands to share common objectives and actions to achieve environmental sustainability.  The project will build a network focusing on two pilot sites, Fiji and New Caledonia.  The project will examine the impacts of climate change and other stressors on the ocean environment and ecosystem services.  The team will investigate the consequences of these impacts on the environment, society, and economy, to develop sustainable and complementary pathways for future development and sustainable ocean stewardship. These pilot sites will create the framework and methodology and serve as a guide for application and adaptation to other interested Pacific Island Countries.  PACPATH will integrate a broad range of existing data sets, generate new data sets, and develop new, locally relevant products that will rely on freely available sources such as from the Copernicus Marine Service.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

When we began the project, the project team was primarily made up of natural and social scientists; discussions on issues often focused on the more academic aspects of issues. The presence of local community representatives in the larger workshops refocused the issues as a human centered problem. For example, in addition to being a physical oceanography phenomenon, sea level rise and subsequent coastal erosion have urgent and real consequences to people living on coastal communities. Communities are facing the prospect of having to relocate from areas that have been home for numerous generations. Although the project team understood this, the ability of local community members to provide this perspective was an important advance in our project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #158155; font-size: 16px;\">Priority issues related to coastal sustainability for local communities in Fiji and New Caledonia.</span></p>\n<p>Issues that were deemed high priority in the New Caledonia and Fiji stakeholder workshops had some common elements, as well as some that were slightly different.

This issue was given equal importance by participants at the Fiji workshop. At the Fiji workshop, however, additional issues were raised related to corruption and poor governance that allowed activities like sand and gravel mining to occur in areas that were ill advised, which led to subsequent pollution issues in rivers and nearby coastal areas. Additional investigation may be required to understand the relative importance of perceived corruption by participants as they relate to pollution in New Caledonia.

The stakeholder engagement process allowed a more nuanced and refined set of issues to emerge, that reflected the relevance of issues from the perspective of stakeholders in the two locations. This new, refined list of priorities includes Coastal Habitats, Sea Level Rise and Erosion (taken together as a common issue), Pollution, and Governance.
