 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the impact of preventable vision loss caused by retinal diseases such as the wet form of advanced macular degeneration (wAMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME). Vision loss has a significant impact on the lives of those who experience it as well as on society as a whole. The retinal therapeutics market was $13 B in 2018 and is projected to grow to $28B in 2025. The proposed project develops a new technology to address multiple aspects of eye disease, which is expected to improve clinical outcomes at reduced cost. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will identify the best approach to combining anti-VEGF and anti-IL8 aptamers to generate a bispecific aptamer. Two different approaches will be evaluated: 1) direct chemical synthesis, in which the individual aptamer components are used to form a bispecific aptamer synthesized as a single compound, and 2) assembly by hybridization, in which individual aptamer components are synthesized separately with complementary extensions subsequently used for assembly. This project will assess the effect of linker identity and length on function, as well as the inhibitory activity, which will be compared with that of the individual aptamer components. The best performing bispecific aptamers will be PEGylated using at least two different PEG variants, and further evaluated. The biophysical properties of the PEGylated compounds will be assessed. These properties are key to establishing parameters for bispecific aptamer formulation and predicting intravitreal half-life. The best performing PEGylated bispecific aptamer function will be evaluated in vivo, to confirm its ability to engage its targets in an established animal model of retinal disease.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDrive Therapeutics has completed the milestones described in award ID #2127185. Three Technical Objectives were completed and the results are summarized below.\n\nTechnical Objective 1 was to identify an optimal strategy for combining two aptamer domains (VEGF and IL8) to create a bispecific aptamer.  Two different strategies were considered to combine the aptamer domains: 1) Direct synthesis and 2) hybridization.  The direct synthesis approach was tested first as it is the preferred strategy from a manufacturing perspective.  Six different bispecific constructs were synthesized with each aptamer domain in alternate orientations using three different linker designs.  The activity of each binding domain of the 6 bispecific constructs was tested separately and compared with the relevant parent monomer aptamer.  The IL8 activity of the 6 bispecific constructs was measured and compared with the activity of the IL8 aptamer.  The VEGF activity of the 6 bispecific constructs was measured and compared with the activity of the VEGF aptamer.  The acceptance criteria for this technical objective were for the binding activity of the bispecific domains to be within 4-fold of the parent monomer aptamers.  The results fell within our acceptance criteria.  Given the commercial preference to utilize direct chemical synthesis, it was determined not to proceed with the hybridization approach.  Two bispecific constructs were selected to proceed to Technical Objective 2. \n\nTechnical Objective 2 was to select and synthesize the best performing compounds from Technical Objective 1 and conjugate a 40 kDa polyethylene glycol carrier (PEG) and measure the in vitro efficacy and physical properties of the PEGylated compounds.  The bispecific constructs were synthesized, and then conjugated to a 40 kDa PEG.  The IL8 and VEGF activity of the 2 bispecific constructs was measured and compared with the relevant parent monomer aptamers and the non-PEGylated bispecific constructs.  The acceptance criteria for this technical objective were for the binding activity of the bispecific domains to be within 4-fold of the non-Pegylated bispecific parent.  The IL8 and VEGF activity of the PEGylated compounds met the acceptance criteria.  With these results, one of the constructs was selected for physical characterization and in vivo testing in Technical Objective 3.  The physical characterization experiment was to measure the hydrodynamic radius of the PEGylated bispecific construct.  The hydrodynamic radius was measured and was significantly better than the acceptance criteria.  This result is very supportive of achieving 4-6-month durability, which is clinically meaningful for retinal disease patients. \n\nTechnical Objective 3 was to validate the optimal PEGylated bispecific candidate molecule activity in vivo.  The bispecific construct from Technical Objective 2 was selected for in vivo testing in a laser choroidal neovascularization (CNV) damage model in farm pigs.  At Day 0 of the study both eyes were damaged by a laser which induces choroidal neovascularization (CNV) followed by treatment with the test articles.  The primary endpoint was reduction in vessel leakage compared to vehicle as determined by Fluorescein Angiography.  The individual parent aptamers as well as the bispecific showed suppression of vascular leakage when compared to vehicle.\n\nThe experiments performed during the grant period accomplished many goals:\n\nProved that the bispecific aptamer construction did not significantly impact the activity of the individual binding domains.\nProved that PEGylation did not significantly impact the activity of the individual binding domains.\nProved that the PEGylated bispecific had a significant increase in hydrodynamic radius, which provides a pharmacokinetic benefit versus standard of care.\nProved that the individual aptamers and the bispecific are active in vivo.\nValidated the biological hypothesis that IL8 is a supplementary pathway of angiogenesis in an acute damage model in the eye.\nShowed a synergistic effect of adding an anti-IL8 therapy to anti-VEGF therapy.\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/12/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas Gooding"
