 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is part of the broader effort, the Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) research initiative and will also contribute to the NSF-funded SNAP-TEC (Sustainably Navigating Arctic Pollution through Engaging Communities) project that includes an intensive field campaign planned for the year 2022.  The goal of ALPACA is to better understand the chemical processing of air pollution during the cold and dark conditions in the wintertime in the Arctic. The objectives of SNAP-TEC are to improve the understanding of wintertime Arctic outdoor and indoor air pollution to assist in the sustainable development of the Arctic and improve air quality for Arctic peoples. Data from this project will become available to the public and other investigators who will be able to utilize it in assessing how to mitigate poor air quality in the wintertime in the Arctic.\r\n\r\nAdditional instrumentation will be deployed to improve the understanding of sulfur oxidation chemistry in the understudied high-latitude environment in Fairbanks, that is greatly impacted by both climate change and poor air quality. The PIs will investigate the formation routes and properties of hydroxymethane sulfonate (HMS) (HOCH2SO3-) in the atmosphere of Fairbanks. The PIs plan to collect online measurements of formaldehyde (HCHO) and PM2.5 inorganic sulfate and HMS with a PILS-IC (Particle-Into-Liquid Sampler coupled to an Ion Chromatograph). Measurements of gas and particle inorganic species that affect particle water and pH also will be measured, since HMS is formed through aqueous phase reactions that are sensitive to particle pH. Steady-state box model simulations will be conducted utilizing the data generated to examine the main chemical drivers of HMS formation in Fairbanks winter. This effort will examine the sensitivity of HMS formation to ambient HCHO and SO2 concentrations, meteorological conditions, aerosol liquid water, particle pH, and ionic strength.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
