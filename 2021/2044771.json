 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Earth\u2019s ionosphere is a layer of atmosphere starting at about 50 miles above the surface of the Earth with relatively high concentration of charged particles.  Long-distance radio communications on Earth rely on reflection of radio waves by this layer; communications between satellites and ground stations rely on radio waves passing through this layer.  The quality of such radio communications highly depends on density of charged particles in the ionosphere.  When there is large variation of the density, radio wave propagation could be disrupted.  One such large density variation at low latitudes is known as equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs), which are often created under the combined influence of diurnal change of solar radiation and the atmosphere wind.  How these bubbles are related to the change of atmospheric wind is a fundamental science question and its understanding could lead to better prediction of when and where these bubbles may form and help to mitigate the interruptions they create.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is to employ observations and modeling to investigate the relationship between thermospheric neutral winds and equatorial spread F (ESF), which is a manifestation of bubbles when detected by radars.  The fundamental science question to be addressed is:  How does the day-to-day variability of neutral winds contribute to the onset and evolution of EPBs?  A multi-year observational data of concurrent thermospheric neutral winds and EPBs in the low latitudes will be developed and used to determine the relationships between winds and ESF/scintillation.  The data will enable monitoring of the development and evolution of ESF and provide a deep insight into both the short-term (hourly, diurnal) and long-term (seasonal) processes and the underlying physics.  Additionally, the SAMI3 (Sami3 is Also a Model of the Ionosphere) ionosphere model will be used to capture the ionospheric dynamics associated with different thermospheric conditions, to allow determination of how various scenarios give rise to EPBs/ESF and how they evolve over short (diurnal) and long (seasonal) time periods.  The SAMI3 model is comprehensive and capable of addressing important problems in aeronomy that are not accessible with other models. The combination of the data and modeling will lead to a fundamentally deeper understanding of the dynamical processes underlying EPBs and ESF. \r\n\r\nOver the long term, the ground-based neutral wind observations could be used to forecast the likelihood of ESF and predict the onset of scintillation and characterize its evolution with time. Being able to predict and characterize ESF/scintillation from ground-based sensors is critical for operational civilian and national security purposes. Scintillation affects trans-ionospheric radio signals up to a few GHz in frequency and as such can have detrimental impacts on systems such as: \r\na) Satellite-based systems that are used for communications, positioning, navigation and timing. \r\nb) Both civil and national security vertical and oblique (over the horizon) radar systems. \r\nc) Scientific instruments requiring observations of trans-ionospheric radio signals (e.g., radio \r\nastronomy). \r\n\r\nAll the software and data from this research will be made publicly available. Support will be provided to students and academics who may want to reproduce and advance the findings using the models and the datasets. JHU/APL will provide in-house participation of high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students to help them get research, education, and professional development experience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nModern communication and navigation systems commonly depend on radio wave signals that transit the ionosphere. At times, the transmission of these radio signals is disrupted by irregular ionospheric structures characterized by large electron density gradients that can occur from the lower ionosphere (near 100km altitude) through to the topside, above 1000km altitude. Large electron density depletions are commonly triggered in the equatorial middle atmosphere, and grow upward into the topside. These \"Equatorial Plasma Bubbles\" (EPBs) can grow explosively and cause scintillation of radio signals traversing the region.\n\n\nTo understand or even predict the triggering and evolution of the EPBs, this project has sought to establish the behavior of neutral (non-ionized) winds in the most dense region of the ionosphere. It has been hypothesized that neutral wind direction and gradients can both trigger and impede EPB onset, and that neutral winds can further effect EPB growth and evolution in space and time.\n\n\nTo investigate the role of neutral winds in the generation of ionospheric irregularities, this component of the collaborative project established instruments to make regular measurements of the wind field near 250km altitude using interferometers capable of measuring the Doppler shift of spectral emissions from the region with precisions smaller than 1m/s. These instruments are established at four sites straddling the earth's magnetic equator. Two instruments are at northern magnetic midlatitude sites in Puerto Rico (Arecibo and Culebra) , and another is established at a similar magnetic latitude in the Southern Hemisphere (Cachoeira Paulista, Brazil) . A fourth instrument was placed at the magnetic equator, in Santarm, Brazil.\n\n\nThis project has been responsible for establishing the instrument at Santarm and performing maintenance on the other three interferometers. Following that instrumentation development, raw data acquisition, data analysis extracting winds and temperatures from the raw data, data transfer from the field locations to U.S. mainland server, and public data distribution project responsibilities and goals for each site.\n\n\nThe primary project outcome for this portion of the collaboration is a data set of neutral wind measurements from four sites near a common Eastern seaboard magnetic meridian, straddling the magnetic equator, and covering hundreds of nights. At Arecibo the interferometer operated on 94% of the available project nights. At Culebra, 80%. At Cachoeira Paulista, the interferometer operated on 95% of the nights during the project, and the Santarm duty cycle was 96% active following the installation of the instrument there in December 2022. These duty cycles (operational nights/available nights) are unparalleled by other ground-based thermospheric wind measurement instruments in use today or in the past.\n\n\nProcessed wind and temperature data are deposited in the public \"Madrigal\" database for Space Physics each morning following data acquisition, except Santarm data, which are provided by the National Institude for Space Physics (INPE) of Brazil, upon request. Data from the previous night can also be viewed each morning on the website www.neutralwinds.com.\n\n\nThe intrinsic merit of this project resides in the establishment of these ground-based thermospheric remote sensing instruments and the precise data that they produce. Establishment of the Santarm site has special merit, because data from the magnetic equator is particularly sparse, since much of that geography is at sea, and direct access for U.S. scientists in South America is difficult. These instruments continue to operate and are available to the international Space Weather community beyond the end of this project.\n\n\nThese data coincide with ionospheric measurements of the EPB events using GPS and DNSS measurements of total electron content near the magnetic equator, all-sky imager measurements of ionospheric structure, and active GOLD satellite measurements of ionospheric structure. Correlating these data sets will significantly advance our understanding of the triggering and evolution of EPBs.\n\n\nOne broader impact this research provides is the information to help mitigate the impact of radio frequency scintillation events on navigation and communication systems through prediction. Along that path, the close collaboration of funded research participants with colleagues hosting instruments in Brazil is invaluable. U.S. scientists now have access to equipment and data from beneath the South Atlantic Magnetic Anamoly and at the magnetic equeator. Brazilian scientists in this collaboration gain operational local instruments, a neutral wind data stream to complement with their radio frequency resources, and hands-on training facilities for students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/16/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RobertBKerr\n"
