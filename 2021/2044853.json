 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) grant investigates a new way to address sustainability in product design. By designing products with multiple perspectives and a longer time horizon in mind, companies can be more profitable, consumers can get better products, and environmental and social wellbeing will improve. Current sustainable design methods focus on individual phases of the product life cycle (e.g., production, use, disposal), decisions of particular stakeholders (e.g., manufacturers, consumers, policy makers), or specific sustainability metrics (e.g., carbon footprint, water consumption, particulate emissions). This project goes beyond these focused methods by developing a holistic approach to sustainable design that accounts for all life cycle phases, stakeholders, and sustainability outcomes, using tools and techniques from the systems engineering and engineering design research communities. This holistic approach is expected to lead to more comprehensive and ubiquitous sustainable design practices, as well as business strategies and policies that influence long-term environmental, social, and economic sustainability from a systems perspective. Additionally, by enhancing the quality and availability of related educational materials at various levels, and by better understanding how people think about sustainability, the pipeline of students and professionals will be better prepared to address complex sustainability challenges.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to enable simultaneous consideration of a product\u2019s relevant life cycle stages, sustainability metrics, stakeholder needs, and subsystem analyses in Design for Sustainability (DfS) by leveraging systems modeling and coordination techniques from the Design for Market Systems (DMS) and Concurrent Engineering (CE) fields. The research approach will: (1) assess coordination and modeling strategies from CE and DMS to connect sustainability-related design parameters and stakeholder decision-making across the product life cycle; (2) investigate the application of CE approaches to measure coupling strength across these decision parameters, life cycle phases, metrics, and models; and (3) survey practitioners to elicit and validate real-world sustainable design needs. This will lead to a new holistic approach that facilitates the design of more sustainable and successful products and systems. To improve knowledge transfer and accessibility of sustainable design concepts with a broad audience of students and professionals, this project includes three interconnected education and outreach activities: (1) raise awareness of sustainable design and systems thinking among pre-college students through a new GK-12 partnership program; (2) disseminate and iteratively update the Holistic Sustainable Design approach through a project-based graduate course; and (3) assess sustainable design thinking across diverse groups of individuals. These education and outreach activities will lead to new validated techniques for teaching sustainable design at various levels, student-generated case studies to support the research framework, and a foundational understanding of how people approach sustainability-related decisions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nThis project explored a new comprehensive approach to sustainable design, drawing from previous research in Design for Sustainability, Design for Market Systems, and Concurrent Engineering. This resulted in a framework that enables designers to model how changing design features will lead to changes in sustainability outcomes. Additionally, the systemic forces that influence the sustainability of a product were mapped out to understand the various stakeholder groups and identify leverage points for improving the system. Finally, two educational programs were developed and facilitated with high school students to raise awareness of sustainability issues in product development and provide hands-on experience through design challenges.\n\n\n\n\nA framework for Holistic Sustainable Design (HSD) was put forward through the integration of a multi-domain matrix (MDM), mathematical change propagation models, and life cycle assessment (LCA). The MDM maps out the dependencies among the quantifiable parameters associated with the product, including design decision (e.g., dimensions, materials), product attributes (e.g., cost, speed, capacity), and sustainability outcomes (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, ecotoxicity, human health). The MDM informs the development of a system of change propagation equations, showing how changes to one design parameter will require or influence updates to other design and performance parameters. An LCA model in the loop, using the ReCiPe 2016 method, was then integrated into the framework to enable automated updates to sustainability metrics. A proof-of-concept model was developed in the Python programming language using the case study of a reusable water bottle, showing how designers can use this approach to perform sensitivity analyses that illustrate how changing a parameter such as the bottle diameter would influence the product performance along with environmental, social and economic sustainability metrics.\n\n\n\n\nRecognizing that design activities do not take place in a vacuum, we further set out to understand sustainable design as a multi-stakeholder system, which includes business decisions, competing producers, substitute products, policy makers, consumers, the general public, and the environment itself. The systemic forces that influence the sustainability of consumer products were explored through a systems thinking analysis of the reusable water bottle case study, which culminated in a causal loop diagram (CLD) that illustrates the relationships among various quantifiable phenomena. The CLD was validated and iterated upon through interviews with experts in the fields of systems engineering, systems thinking, and sustainability. This model includes 42 nodes that represent a wide range of quantities from design decisions such as the height of the water bottle, to business decisions such as pricing and marketing, to policy decisions such as incentives and requirements, to sustainability impacts such as emissions to the air and hydration of people. Through the connections among these multidisciplinary system aspects, we were able to identify critical feedback loops and leverage points that can be used to advance the transition toward sustainability through product design and policies.\n\n\n\n\nThe educational component of the project included the development and facilitation of two programs for high school students. In the summer of 2022, we developed a 2.5-hour summer program on sustainable design and facilitated it with 100 high school students. For this program, we developed an interactive dashboard in Python that allows students to design their own reusable water bottle, and interactively see how those decisions influence different sustainability metrics. The exercise included four design activities that explored how students might make decisions under different objectives: economic success, environmental impacts, social impacts, and triple-bottom-line sustainability. In the spring of 2023, the PI worked with the New York Academy of Sciences (NYAS) and Jersey City Public Schools (JCPS) to develop a Sustainable Design STEAM Challenge, which asked student teams to pick a classroom object and redesign it in a more sustainable way. The PI recorded informational video mini-lectures about design processes and sustainability, and the challenge took student teams through the process of analyzing products, brainstorming and selecting new concept ideas, building prototypes, and delivering final presentations in front of a panel of judges.\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed HSD approach to design has the potential for wide-ranging contributions to society's sustainability priorities, by transforming the ways that various stakeholders are able to holistically account for sustainability in their decision making. This comprehensive and user-centric approach to sustainable design can enable designers, business strategists, and policy makers to produce and promote more sustainable products and systems that result in steady, secure, long-term economic success.\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/10/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: StevenHoffenson\n"
