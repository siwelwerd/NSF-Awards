 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dayna Patterson is awarded a FY21 Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research (NSF MPS-Ascend) Fellowship from the Chemistry Division, to conduct a program of research and activities related to broadening participation by groups underrepresented in Chemistry at Northwestern University.  The project being performed by Dayna Patterson, entitled Characterization and biosynthesis of non-methanotrophic methanobactins, is to be conducted under the guidance of mentoring scientist Amy Rosenzweig. This project is supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.\r\n\r\nMethane-oxidizing (methanotrophic) bacteria are known to acquire copper (Cu) for their function. To do so, many of the methanotrophic bacteria encode for ribosomally produced, post-translationally modified Cu-binding natural products known as methanobactins (Mbns).  Planned work is focused on elucidating the biosynthetic function of the uncharacterized biosynthetic protein, MbnX, which is involved in producing the still uncharacterized Group V Mbns.  The Fellow will utilize genetic, structural, and biochemical techniques to produce and characterize a new Mbn from the insect pathogen Xenorhabdus beddingii DSM 4764. The structure of this Mbn will provide insight into MbnX\u2019s biosynthetic role, and to further understand MbnX, its structure and function will be explored.  Activities that will support broadening participation of underrepresented minorities in Chemistry will include a research shadowing experience for students from a local minority-serving community college, and starting a local chapter of the National Organization of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE) which will nucleate a community for underrepresented students in STEM at Northwestern University.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
