 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project relates to the unmet need for new and effective therapeutics that target the lung. This proposal outlines a novel treatment for the pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19; however, this technology will also find use in other acute pulmonary disorders, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and cystic fibrosis. Currently the options for treatment of pulmonary disorders include supplemental oxygen, ventilators, or nitrous oxide (NO) gas, which is toxic and cumbersome to use. Current technology uses gaseous NO which is a toxic gas supplied in high pressure tanks and is present only when inhaling the gas. The proposed project will develop a long-lasting, inhaled NO delivery system to improve lung function of patients suffering from ARDS brought on by COVID-19 or other causes.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project advances translation of a novel molecule which sequesters NO chemically as a stable solid and can be engineered to degrade at a controlled rate for in situ continuous release. This proposal develops NO donors with optimized performance and stability for pulmonary delivery.  Tasks include: develop and test libraries of NO donor compounds for the ability and rate of NO release; evaluate and select compounds with good solubility characteristics to formulate for aerosolization/ nebulization; test candidates for improvement of lung function in animal models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The severe reduction in pulmonary function brought on by novel coronavirus infection can lead to lengthy stays in the ICU, extended use of ventilators, and death. Current treatment options are limited and severely affected cases often require extensive ICU care, tying up valuable resources for weeks.\n\nThe goal of this research is to deliver Nitric oxide directly to the lung of patients suffering from respiratory complications arising from COVID-19. This will be accomplished using a novel new compound which releases nitric oxide upon contact with the lung. These compounds (called NONOates: see Figure 1 for generic structures) are capped with an ester functionality which blocks nitric oxide release until it is removed in the body.  Nitric oxide is known to improve lung function in patient suffering from acute respiratory distress so this technology would also be able to address respiratory complications brought on by other causes such as COPD, asthma, emphysema, and cystic fibrosis. Our technology is designed to deliver nitric oxide to the lung over long periods of time at variable concentrations.\n\n \n\nSynthesis and NO release testing of novel NONOates:  A total of 35 compounds were prepared and tested for NO release using industry standard methods to measure nitric oxide. All 35 compounds show no release of nitric oxide in water, but differing rates of release in mouse plasma.  This provides proof that these compounds are stable on the shelf, but release nitric oxide only when in the body.  Furthermore, depending on the structure of the compounds, the nitric oxide release can be fast or slow and the amount of nitric oxide release can be large or small.  This is important bas it allows the researcher to fine tune the amount and length of Nitric oxide dosing; something that is impossible if using gaseous nitric oxide.\n\nTesting in mice:   Due to difficulties with access to the animal facility, we were forced to change facilities midway through the study and unfortunately were forced to constrain the animal testing.  Eventually we were able to test two compounds in hamsters at 3 different concentrations at the new facility.  Due to the relative insolubility of the compounds, we were constrained in the amount of compound we could dose.  While we were able to come up with an acceptable formulation, with more time and funding, a better formulation could be found which would allow for higher dosing.  Using the present formulation, we dosed several groups of hamsters including a control group with no drug, an uninfected control group and several different dosages of 2 nitric oxide releasing compounds.\n\nAfter treatment the lungs were examined for damage and general health.  While there was some statistical significance between the cumulative scores of treated groups and the infected/untreated group, with the infected/untreated group showing less pathology, generally the experiments were inconclusive.\n\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing and delivering compounds that release NO to the lung of COVID 19 infected hamsters.  Unfortunately, due to several setbacks and sub optimal animal studies, the in vivo work is inconclusive.  While, no toxicity was observed in the animals, only moderate therapeutic effects, which were not statistically significant, were observed.\n\nFuture directions:   Due to problems with the study design, the current animal studies were inconclusive.  In order to accurately test these compounds in animals, a l better formulation which will to allow higher dosing is needed.  In addition, the studies need to be repeated with dosing over 7-10 days.  In addition, the readout should be blood oxygenation, rather than histopathology of lung damage.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven W Riesinger"
