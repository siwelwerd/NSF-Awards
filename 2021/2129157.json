 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a virtual conference on May 6-7 2021 that will bring together some of the world\u2019s leading mathematics, epidemiological, and social science scholars in order to chart a research agenda that enable policy makers to understand how infectious disease, economics, and society shape each other. Infectious diseases alter the United State's economy, society, and culture in complex ways, and these economic and social changes influence the way a pandemic develops. For example, the on-going COVID-19 pandemic is having substantial economic, educational, social, and societal consequences, including changes in work and housing habits, labor markets, and social justice dialogues. Similarly, the HIV epidemic had a major impact on our society in the 1980's, far beyond those immediately impacted by the virus. Mathematical models help make sense of these complex interactions. Constructing models of such complex socio-economic-epidemiological systems requires experts from the constituent fields to work together. The PIs anticipate the research agenda developed in the workshop will facilitate the research communities to discover new mathematical methods and modeling approaches to jointly forecast epidemiological, economic and social patterns so that future pandemics are mitigated with lower social and economic cost.\r\n\r\nThe conventional approach to the modelling of infectious diseases is to collect basic life-cycle data on the disease, and to overlay that onto structured population data to predict prevalence patterns, health outcomes, using differential equations, networks, agent-based simulations, or another related modelling approaches. These approaches are quite successful at day-ahead prediction, but aside from largely ad hoc parametric adjustments, these standard approaches have almost no ability to connect to behavioral based interventions. These means that the models are not helpful for measuring the benefits and costs (broadly defined) of non-pharmaceutical interventions, which are critical when novel pathogens emerge.  There is expert knowledge and modeling work, related to epidemics, in economics and social sciences that can be used to better describe transmission, while providing internally consistent connections to society and the economy. But the disciplinary divides are difficult to bridge. There are limits in data collection, including scale, precision, and representativeness. This difficulty has been amplified by the fast growth of the scholarly literature over the last few years. Bringing together a diverse group of scholars, scientists, and modelers will help everybody interested in the field better understand what has been accomplished so far and produce a research agenda for improving mathematical models in human epidemiology in the future. More information can be found at the conference web site http://the-mathepi-behavior-bridge.site/\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences through the Mathematical Biology Program, and the SBE Division of Social and Economic Sciences Sociology Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project proposed to organize and host a virtual conference of approximately\n 50 participants on May 6 and 7th, 2021. The purpose of this conference was to f\nacilitate collaboration among researchers from applied mathematics, infectious d\nisease epidemiology, economics, psychology, communication, and sociology to better understand the current state and limitations of predictive epidemic models that incorporate the interdependent and intertwining dynamics of behavior and the social and structural environments in which behavior unfolds.\n\nThe spread of infectious disease is hard to forecast.  Human factors such as wea\nlth, status, psychology, and culture influence transmission behaviors.  These fa\nctors can further interact with laws, policies, and public health recommendation\ns in unexpected ways.  The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic provided many examples of these challenges, and the need for a better understanding of these factors in policy design and messaging.\n\nWe proposed, organized, lead, and participated in a conference giving participan\nts an opportunity to share their scholarly expertise on these topics with other \nexperts.  The conference was called \"Bridging disciplinary divides for behaviora\nlly modulated mathematical models in human epidemiology\", took place May 6-7, 2021, and the conference materials are still publicly available through the confer\nence website.  This conference helped identify open problems in the fields impor\ntant for future mathematical modeling and forecasting of pandemic progress.\n\nThe broader impacts of this conference were to help break down some of the disciplinary barriers frustrating progress in infectious disease modelling.  By bring\ning these diverse groups -- including mathematicians, economists, sociologists, \nanthropologists, and statisticians -- together, we were able to help research gr\noups and the NSF chart paths forward in this important research field.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/05/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy Reluga"
