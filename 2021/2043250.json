 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central role of software in the operation of defense, energy, communication, transportation, and manufacturing systems makes it increasingly important that these systems are designed in a way that integrates cybersecurity principles. The renewal of the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) will continue the support of highly qualified students, in particular Latinx and female students, who complete a cybersecurity-focused program and graduate with the ability to apply disciplined software development principles and processes. UTEP is uniquely positioned to contribute to efforts to improve diversity in the cybersecurity workforce due to the population it serves, which includes Hispanic, first generation, and lowest income quartile students. UTEP students do not fit the \u201ctraditional\u201d student profile of a full-time student transitioning directly from high school to a four-year college or university as many students transfer from local community colleges and pursue their education part-time. Over the past five years, UTEP has made significant advances in developing cybersecurity educational programs, research, and outreach activities at UTEP and beyond. These efforts have resulted in recognitions including the National Security Agency designation as a Center of Academic Excellence in both Cyber Defense and Cyber Operations (only one of 21 across the nation), as well as the designation as an Army Research Lab-South remote campus in cybersecurity.\r\n\r\nUTEP\u2019s SFS Scholars complete rigorous educational programs with a focus on cybersecurity and complement the knowledge gained in the classroom through significant involvement in cybersecurity research, training, competitions, and hands-on activities. All UTEP SFS Scholars are also required to engage in service to the community to build cybersecurity awareness and capabilities among UTEP students and beyond. The goals of the UTEP SFS program are to 1) recruit and retain at least 30 students into UTEP\u2019s Master of Science in Software Engineering and the doctoral computer science programs; 2) graduate students who will enter the workforce with the ability to transfer state-of-the-art cybersecurity techniques and approaches into practice; 3) place students in government positions that utilize their knowledge and capabilities in cybersecurity, with a focus on placing graduates in federal/executive entities; and 4) advance cybersecurity awareness and competencies among K-12 students and educators.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
