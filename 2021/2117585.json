 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Boston University is acquiring an optical tweezer instrument for nano-manipulation and force spectroscopy of nanoscale objects to support the research of Maria Kamenetska and colleagues Kenneth Rothschild and Keith Brown. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of chemistry, materials science, nanoscience, and biology. In general, optical tweezers are used for nano-manipulation and force spectroscopy of nanoscale objects in solution. Optical tweezers help isolate and manipulate single target molecules in an optical trap. Because trapping occurs at the focal plane of an optical microscope, light emission by the isolated molecule can be detected simultaneously with force. This allows for manipulation of materials so that mechanistic understanding of processes down to the single molecule level can be developed. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments as well as provides accessibility to this specialized science to nearby institutions. \r\n\r\nThe award of an optical tweezer (OT) instrument for the nano-manipulation and force spectroscopy of nanoscale objects is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as chemistry, materials and nanomaterials, and biological systems. Research in chemistry and nanomaterials focus on probing the mechanical properties of and electron transport in one dimensional nanowires and two dimensional flakes. Conformational changes of single molecules in light-activated transmembrane ion channels, pumps, and sensors are studied as are structure-mechanics relationships of polymer microfibrils. Biological systems are also studied by quantifying defects in nucleosome stability at telomeric DNA.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
