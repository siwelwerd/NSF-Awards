 "awd_abstract_narration": "While modern developments in large-scale sensing and imaging modalities bring great premise in discovering novel scientific phenomena and improving the quality-of-life, making sense of the sensed data in an efficient and accurate manner require transformative designs of scalable and effective optimization methods for solving inverse problems that go beyond classical linear models. There is a significant need to advance the theory, algorithms, and applications of nonlinear inverse problems, where the collected data exhibit a nonlinear relationship with respect to the unknowns being sought after. Focused on taming nonlinear inverse problems, this project will be tightly integrated with education, outreach and dissemination activities including mentoring both graduate and undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds, developing courses and monographs on nonlinear inverse problems in data science, and organizing special sessions at suitable conference venues.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual goal of this project is to develop theoretical and algorithmic foundations for solving nonlinear inverse problems, including the design and analysis of efficient algorithms with provable guarantees, characterization of fundamental trade-offs between resources (sample, computational and memory complexities, signal-to-noise ratio, etc.) and performance (statistical error rates, resolution, etc.), and validations on real data whenever applicable. The project seeks to leverage the diversity of multiple measurements and the invariance of data representation in the algorithm designs to minimize complexity and improve performance. The tools and techniques developed in this project will lead to further cross fertilization among the fields of signal processing, inverse problems, optimization theory, and machine learning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
