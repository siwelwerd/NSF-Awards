This CREST-PRF project is aligned with the research focus of the CREST Center for Innovation Research and Education in Environmental Nanotechnology at the University of Puerto Rico \u2013 Rio Piedras Campus. The goal of this research is for the post doctoral fellow to investigate water remediation treatment from salinity intrusion via a desalination method based on novel polymers. The proposed work has the potential to increase understanding about the waters in the Las Cucharillas community. \r\n\r\nThe proposed work intends to study salinity intrusion into water aquifers through a detailed examination of water remediation treatment from salinity intrusion via a desalination method using novel polymers. A specific aim of the research is to synthesize materials with non-biofouling features that may be used in seawater environments. An environmentally friendly zwitterionic poly(carboxybetainmethacrylate) (PCBMA) based polymer will be studied and characterized. This utilization of this hydrophilic polymer has the potential to have water purification applications which may prevent organic matter attachment. This proposed method has the potential to preserve the island groundwater sources and associated natural ecosystems. The successful implementation of this project has the potential to yield significant information to advance understanding regarding the use of hydrophilic polymers via emerging polymeric grafting techniques.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Recent studies performed throughout the coastal wetlands of Puerto Rico, revealed a significant increase in salinity along water-land interfaces. Therefore, the overall intention of this project is to conduct a study about water remediation treatment from salinity intrusion via desalination method using novel polymers to preserve the island ground waters sources and its associated natural eco-systems for generations to come.</p>\n<p>Zwitterionic polymers have proven to be a promising non-fouling material that can be applied in the design of selective layers of thin film composite (TFC) membranes. Extending the permeability and usage of TFC membranes have attracted increasing interest in membrane-based desalination processes since water-flux reduction associated to biofouling persist nowadays as a common challenge. As a consequence of being in a condensed state of matter, liquids and solids will have the property of cohesive energy between their molecules. For example, when in liquid bulk water molecules itself will tend to make hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions with the nearest neighbor-atoms (Figure 2a). However, when there is an interface such as liquid/solid, such molecules are unable to fully form the same bonding dynamics and interactions as when in pure liquid (Figure 2b). When using a hydrophilic layer, non-polar (hydrophobic) molecules that are suspended in water will be repelled because it is difficult to develop polar and hydrogen bonds. Thus by virtue of its strong hydration, this polymer category is very useful to counteract biofouling in marine and biomedical applications, but the benefits from its applications in membrane technology are still emerging. The efficacy of the non-fouling property as a function of the polymer&rsquo;s molecular weight remained unknown at the beginning of this project. In pursuit of that vision, this study fostered new scientific insights via probing different molecular weights of poly(carboxybetain methacrylate) (PCBMA) to construct the selective layer of a TFC membrane for water desalination application.</p>\n<p>The outcomes from the scientific research funded under this award have advanced our understanding about the intrinsic effect of the applied polymer molecular weight in the design of selective layers. This would tremendously help in tuning the target functionalities of TFC membranes. Our findings suggested that using an intermediate size molecular weight (PCBMA Mn 50,000) will result in the best operational performance of the zwitterionic membrane (zM). The intermediate size resulted in the lowest flux decline rate (R<sub>t</sub>) of 0.01&plusmn;0.001 (zM-50) when compared to the unmodified control membrane 0.56 &plusmn; 0.071 (M0) after using a model BSA foulant solution. Upon using real water from the <em>Las Cucharillas</em> wetland aquifer, the water flux (J<sub>w</sub>) surprisingly increased particularly for the higher molecular weights (zM-50 and zM-100). Outcomes revealed a J<sub>w</sub> improvement by 68% (zM-10) and 62% (zM-100). Saline water has the effect of increasing the hydration capacity of the zwitterionic chains which facilitates water transport phenomena. The constructed zM membranes might serve as a model to develop further novel selective layers for TFC membranes.</p>\n<p>This project had a strong educational and outreach component.
