 "awd_abstract_narration": "Disaster documentation has traditionally been considered a single location, post-event activity, but increasingly there is the recognition that disasters can impact multiple communities over a relatively short period of time and that there is significant value in understanding in near real-time the population\u2019s response, as a threat moves across communities. To this end, this study will use on-the-ground observers to capture perishable data at 11 domestic and 5 international locations for 2 months related to street-level behavior of individuals leaving COVID-19 medical facilities. The documentation will include gender, touch behavior, mask usage, and destination and transportation choices. By revisiting a subset of healthcare facilities documented over 9 weeks in the Spring 2020 study, critical longitudinal data will be generated for that study\u2019s 8 most documented site, and by extending the approach to 3 other US cities and 5 hospitals in 3 foreign cities, the approach\u2019s robustness across different cultures and communities can begin to be tested. Given the spread of disease across different communities both nationally and internationally, this broader set of data will be especially important in addressing strategies for containing COVID-19 across the U.S. \r\n\r\nThis project is expected to collect 14,000+ records on COVID-19 related behaviors outside of medical facilities. This project will also investigate whether the use of standardized software and protocols can enable delivery to the world community near real-time individual, spatial behavioral data. Finally, the project will consider the remote deployment of student researchers through 3 different means: (1) hiring an institution\u2019s students at home locations (domestic and foreign) away from the main campus using a virtual coordinator; (2) using resources at an American University operating an overseas campus; and (3) using resources at a non-American University operating overseas. Training, coordination, deployment, and data harvesting issues will be evaluated in terms of difficulty, effectiveness, and quality. This project will train 29 young researchers in novel fieldwork, which will translate into a unique, public dataset of high usability information related to COVID-19.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To this end, this study used on-the-ground observers to capture perishable data at more than a dozen domestic healthcare facilities (hospitals and urgent care centers) and similar hospital in 5 international locations. This was done for approximately 2 months at each location to observe street-level behavior of individuals leaving COVID-19 medical facilities. The documentation includes gender, touch behavior, mask usage, and choices of both destination and transportation. This project was a follow on to a similar, exclusively NYC-based study previously conducted over 9 weeks in the Spring 2020 at the onset of COVID-19. The project was coordinated out of New York University by Prof. Debra Laefer from the Tandon School of Engineering and Christopher Dickey of the School of Global Public Health but with significant support in Lebanon from Dr.&nbsp;Martine Najem of the&nbsp;America University of Beirut and in Mexico by Dr.&nbsp;Isidro Guti&eacute;rrez of the Autonomous University of Quer&eacute;taro. The NYU team trained all domestic participants, the NYU students in Haiti, Russia, and Canada, and the local leadership teams in Queretaro and Beirut, who in turn trained their local observers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>The project had three main aims. (1) The first aim was to capture perishable data related to egress behaviors from COVID-19 treatment healthcare facilities as a comparison dataset. This was done at 8 of the original 16 DETER sites. There were over 1,500 records collect from those sites that are available for direct comparison to the original 5,200 records. (2) The second aim was to test the suitability of the observational approach to non-NYC facilities. Testing this hypothesis was done at multiples scales and distances: (i) regional: 2 hospitals in New Jersey, 1 in Connecticut, and 1 in Pennsylvania; (ii) national: 1 hospital each in Tennessee, Texas, and California; and (iii) international: 1 hospital each in Haiti, Russia, Canada, Lebanon, and Mexico. In all cases the data were collected correctly and seamlessly and, thus, fully compatible to the other 6,800 records as a fully interoperable resource. (3) The third aim was to test whether preselection and the preparation of training materials would be sufficient to over the significant data cleaning and interoperability problems from the initial 2020 DETER deployment at the height of the first wave of COVID-19 in New York City. This was also achieved. The data were properly collected and georeferenced in ways that allowed their uploading and merging without weeks of manual cleaning. This enabled their near immediate reuse. While riots and strict quarantines in Beirut precluded direct week-to-week comparison of behaviors, significant insights were gained between the US, Mexican, Russian, and Haitian data.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts</p>\n<p>Given the spread of disease across different communities both nationally and internationally, this broader set of data was intended to understand the potential transferability of strategies across cultures and languages. While the data collection provided employment to 16 NYU students (graduate and undergraduate), 5 undergraduates and 1 post-doc in Lebanon, and 2 graduate students and 10 undergraduates in Mexico, the project was much more than that. This COVID-19 RAPID deployment brought together (through semi-weekly zoom sessions) the collectors from all over the world to share their experiences and insights. This allowed the student data collectors and trainers to gain a direct sense of being part of a larger and highly multi-layered scientific investigation in which individual team members could ask questions and seek advice from participants around the globe. Notably, many of the US based students spent further time with the project through a 1.5 credit guided research opportunity. They were joined by more than a dozen other engineering students who had not participated in the data collection. The data have also been used in a variety of undergraduate and graduate course in Global Public Health.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 06/25/2024<br>\nModified by: Debra&nbsp;F&nbsp;Laefer</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2106316/2106316_10712194_1719338397395_Dashboard_page_3--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2106316/2106316_10712194_1719338397395_Dashboard_page_3--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Touching by females 2021\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2106316/2106316_10712194_1719338397395_Dashboard_page_3--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Touching by females 2021\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dashboard showing first and second items touched by females leaving COVID treatment centers in Winter and Spring 2021</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sonam Bagul</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Debra&nbsp;F&nbsp;Laefer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Touching by females 2021</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2106316/2106316_10712194_1719338249061_Dashboard_page_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2106316/2106316_10712194_1719338249061_Dashboard_page_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"PPE usage across all facilities by date\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2106316/2106316_10712194_1719338249061_Dashboard_page_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"PPE usage across all facilities by date\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dashboard showing how PPE usage decreased across all facilities from late Fall 2020 through Spring 2021</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sonam Bagul</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Debra&nbsp;F&nbsp;Laefer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">PPE usage across all facilities by date</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2106316/2106316_10712194_1719338943248_Dashboard_page_5--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2106316/2106316_10712194_1719338943248_Dashboard_page_5--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Destinations Interim and Final\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2106316/2106316_10712194_1719338943248_Dashboard_page_5--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Destinations Interim and Final\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dashboard image showing the interim and final destinations of all observed individuals</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sonam Bagul</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Debra&nbsp;F&nbsp;Laefer\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Destinations Interim and Final</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2106316/2106316_10712194_1719338115678_Dashboard_page_1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2106316/2106316_10712194_1719338115678_Dashboard_page_1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Records by facility\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2106316/2106316_10712194_1719338115678_Dashboard_page_1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Records by facility\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dashboard images of available records per facility for US and non-US locations late Fall 2020 -
