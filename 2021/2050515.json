 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to serve the national need of recruiting, preparing, and retaining highly effective STEM teachers who understand the lives of the children they teach. The project will provide STEM undergraduate students with opportunities to work with K-12 students on STEM projects.  This experience is expected to help many of the undergraduates decide to pursue STEM teaching as a career. Once these STEM undergraduate students are on a path to become high school STEM teachers, they will be immersed in additional community and industry experiences, such as summer science camps. By combining these experiences with field experiences in schools, the project aims to build a network of STEM, industry, and education mentors. The mentors will be positioned to guide the prospective STEM teachers through their preparation for teaching and their introductory years as STEM teachers. With a strong network of support and a deep understanding of the community in which they teach, it is expected that these new teachers will be retained in high-need schools, thus potentially reducing teacher shortages in STEM fields. \r\n \r\nThis project at Dalton State College, a Hispanic-Serving Institution, includes partnerships with two local high-need school districts (Whitfield County and Dalton Public Schools) and Shaw and Mohawk Industries, two of the world\u2019s largest floorcovering manufacturers with a combined total of more than 63,000 employees and $14 billion in annual sales.  The project goal is to recruit and prepare 22 new biology, math, and chemistry secondary teachers by recruiting undergraduate STEM majors into teaching careers. The project's prospective teachers will be matched with a selected cadre of STEM teachers who will serve as mentors. While working at STEM community events, the prospective teachers will have an opportunity to develop an understanding of the contexts of K-12 students\u2019 lives. Through STEM industry externships, the prospective teachers will learn how to connect local STEM jobs to the STEM content they are teaching and will broaden their network of STEM mentors. Through focus group interviews with stakeholders, surveys, and analysis of observational data, the scientific and education communities will develop an understanding of the impact of mentoring, community engagement, and industry immersion on the preparation and retention of STEM teachers. Increasing teacher's knowledge about the community in which they serve will be the most important broader impact of this work. The network that has been created between teachers and industry has potential to help change the perceptions of advanced manufacturing careers, a focus of the community. Prospective teachers will share their industry experiences at community organizations, which may increase the sustainability of the program beyond the life of the project.  This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
