 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EAR-IF award will provide funds for the acquisition of an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) and an ion chromatograph (IC) to increase geochemical and hydrological research and education at the University of Oklahoma. The instruments will enhance research capacity in the School of Geosciences (SoG) by filling a critical analytical void and increase access for faculty, students, and external researchers to aqueous metal and anion/cation analyses. The ICP-OES and IC will support on-going research focusing on dissolved organic matter \u2013 trace metal interactions in streams and groundwater, acid mine drainage geochemistry and hydrology, land use impacts on water quality, chemical weathering on Earth and Mars, as well as on brine geochemistry. Critical research training of undergraduate and graduate students will be accomplished by integrating the use of the instruments in courses and research experiences. Funding for outreach activities focusing on environmental chemistry and water quality education will involve watershed groups, citizen scientists, and underrepresented minority URM populations and will incorporate direct exposure to the instrumentation.\r\n\r\nOklahoma University will use the funds provided by this award to purchase a Thermo Scientific iCap Pro XP Duo ICP-OES and a Dionex Integrion High-Pressure Ion Chromatograph (HPIC).  The ICP-OES (with accompanying hydride system) will provide sensitive elemental and trace metal analysis of: 1) Groundwater and surface waters; 2) Brines and high total dissolved solids (TDS) aqueous samples; 3) Soil and sediment leachates; and 4) Digested rocks. The simultaneous, dual view ICP-OES (Thermo Scientific iCap Pro XP) has the optical sensitivity and resolution that is ideal for the wide range of sample elemental composition and concentrations.  The HPIC system is ideal for analysis of major anions (i.e., Cl-, NO3-, SO42-) and cations (i.e., Na+, Ca2+, NH4+) in natural waters and perchlorate ion (ClO4-) in brine geochemistry. The high-pressure capability of the HPIC will allow sensitive determination of ions with enhanced peak resolution in expected complex aqueous matrices. The relative ease of use and robustness of ICP-OES and IC is ideal for hands-on use by students, post-doctoral staff, faculty, and outside users in support of research and education. New collaboration with citizen science groups (Blue Thumb) and pre-college institutions will utilize the instrument as part of continuing STEAM outreach initiatives by the SoG at Oklahoma University. Collaborative environmental educational outreach with tribal educational institutions such as the Jones Academy and Navajo Nation is vital to increasing participation of Native Americans in the geosciences. Outreach funding also includes a part-time graduate student mentor to provide outreach support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
