 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arianne Hunter is awarded a FY21 Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research (NSF MPS-Ascend) Fellowship to conduct a program of research and activities related to broadening participation by groups underrepresented in Chemistry at Cal Tech.  The project being performed by Arianne Hunter, entitled Development of an Asymmetric Electrochemical-NHK Reaction using Multivariate Linear Regression Analyses, is to be conducted under the guidance of mentoring scientist Sarah E. Reisman. This project is supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.  \r\n\r\nThis project utilizes multivariate linear regression (MLR) models to guide the identification of a privileged ligand class that will transform the electrochemically driven Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi reaction (e-NHK) into a highly enantioselective method. The specific aims include screening ligands to identify privileged scaffolds that produce high levels of asymmetry, developing tethered ligands to increase the efficiency and asymmetry of the reaction, and conducting electroanalytical investigations into the formation of heteronuclear complexes. These in-depth studies into the e-NHK using data science-driven MLR models and electroanalytical/spectroelectrochemical mechanistic investigations will contribute a new fundamental understanding of the Cr and Ni speciation in the e-NHK. Dr. Hunter will also work to broaden participation through efforts like starting a NOBCChE chapter, participating in the Diversity in Chemistry Initiative at Caltech, and working with the Caltech Center for Teaching, Learning, and Outreach. Dr. Hunter also plans to use her extensive background in organizing scientific community outreach, gained through her non-profit \u201cWe Do Science Too\u201d and her work with \u201cGirlTech\u201d of Oklahoma City, to organize outreach activities at Pasadena High School.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
