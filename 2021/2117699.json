 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The University of North Dakota is acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with liquid nitrogen cooled probe to support research of Guodong Du and colleagues Mikhail Golovko, Alena Kubatova, Chad Wocken, and Feng Xiao. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as permitting study of chemically and biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. The probe uses nitrogen-cooled radiofrequency coils that deliver greatly enhanced sensitivity. Access to a state-of-the-art NMR spectrometer is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution and the instrument will also serve collaborators from tribal colleges and other neighboring institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award of a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with sensitivity-enhancing cryoprobe is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels at the University of North Dakota (UND) and at collaborating institutions. Research projects at UND that is expected to especially benefit from this instrument include the characterization of biodegradable materials synthesized from renewable resources and the construction of two-dimensional polymeric materials prepared from renewable materials using photo-energy. The instrumentation for the characterization of lignin and its degradation products as well as to structurally characterize synthesized aminophosphines and related bidentate ligands for palladium. In addition, the new high field NMR instrument will allow for the characterization of species obtained by converting flare gas to carbon products using hybrid plasma and catalyst reactors and to assist researchers in developing and engineering polymeric membranes for gas separation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
