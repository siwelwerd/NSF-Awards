 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative effort will contribute to the interagency-supported Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) program, that includes the NSF-funded Sustainably Navigating Arctic Pollution Through Engaging Communities (SNAP-TEC) project. This project focuses on chemical mechanisms for the conversion of sulfur dioxide to particulate sulfate under the cold, low-light conditions in Fairbanks Alaska. This research also will investigate the ability of snow chemistry to affect air quality. The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of the chemical mechanisms for forming air pollution in northerly regions, such as in Fairbanks. \r\n\r\nThe following two hypotheses will be examined through a combination of field, laboratory, and modeling studies: (1) Brown carbon drives the oxidation of S(IV) to particle sulfate through reactions involving BrC-derived triplet excited states (3C*) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); and (2) The persistent winter snowpack has a significant influence on the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere (e.g., through release of HONO), as well as on the processing of sulfur and nitrogen. \r\n\r\nOne of the broader impacts of this research includes the development of science modules for local middle school students. The modules will be made freely available to teachers, homeschooling parents, and self-guided students. For the homeschooling audience, the PIs plan to supplement the activities with projects that utilize data from air monitoring networks that leverage active-learning principles. The homeschooling sub-focus is particularly important for Alaska Native and American Indian populations, who rely on homeschooling much more than other groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project investigated the chemistry of sulfur and nitrogen in air and snow during the dark winters in Fairbanks, Alaska during the Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis (ALPACA). The measurements took place in January and February 2022 and included sulfur, nitrogen, and other compounds in the air and snow at different depths as well as the meteorological conditions, including detailed measurements of sunlight. The University of Houstons responsibility for this project was to measure the amount of sunlight above the snow. This allowed us to calculate the rate at which the light was causing chemical reactions. Some of the particle samples from the air and snow were also taken back to the laboratory which allowed the chemistry to be studied under controlled conditions. The results of the laboratory and measurements in Fairbanks were then combined to develop a model which can simulate the air exchanging above and within the small pockets of air within the snowpack. It also accounts for whether the reactions are taking place in the air above the snow, in the trapped air pockets within the snow, or in the water on the surface of the ice and snow crystals. Finally, since this model was developed using the specific measurements and data from this project, it was modified to be able to use data from other sources so that it can be more useful to other researchers.\n\n\nThis work helped show that chemistry within the snow can have a significant impact on atmospheric chemistry. Nitrous acid can be formed in the snow and transported into the atmosphere, making it an important driver of chemistry in Fairbanks during the winter. Additionally, many undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral researchers were supported and trained during this work. At the University of Houston, this included two postdoctoral researchers over the lifetime of this project, both of whom are now scientists at other institutions.\n\n\nThe results from this work have been shared at national and international meetings, and several additional papers are in preparation for submission to journals. The work has also been shared outside of the scientific community through a series of newspaper articles which were published in the Fairbanks Daily News Miner in March and April 2024. This work was also presented to the Fairbanks population through an open house event and to Fairbanks school children through the Science Potpourri. Both events took place at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/24/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JamesFlynn\n"
