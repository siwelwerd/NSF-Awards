 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the State University of New York College at Cortland, in collaboration with the Hormel Institute at the University of Minnesota and Ithaca College, will support 10 students for 12 weeks of virtual research training and professional development during the summer of 2021. In this fully online program, students take part in guided independent research as part of an online community of peers to analyze and predict the relationship between structure and function in biomolecules. To foster community and to strengthen communication skills, students will also participate in weekly informal social events, professional development activities, and meet for an in-person capstone research symposium at the end of the summer. The inherent flexibility of this virtual format make this program broadly accessible to a wide variety of students, including those who would not otherwise be able to access on-site REU programs. \r\n\r\nParticipants in this program will learn about molecular interactions and explore structure-function relationships in an environment that is supportive and flexible, guided by a team of faculty and peer mentors. The independent research conducted by the summer research students aims to advance our understanding of enzyme function, primary and secondary metabolism, and may help to provide foundations for improvements in biosynthetic pathway engineering. By pairing relevant and independent research projects with professional development and community building, this program seeks to provide a positive, authentic research experience to a diverse group of students early in their academic careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For the 2021 cohort of MIV-REU students, greater than 75% reported that they faced barriers to participation in an 'in person' REU program.

The work culminated in students proposing and testing a novel hypothesis based on their work. In the final week of the program, the students presented their work in poster format at a virtual symposium held over two days. Throughout the summer students also participated in weekly professional development activities including interactive sessions on effective literature searches, preparing a CV or resume, online networking tools, and individual development plans, as well as moderated panel discussions on science careers away from the bench, getting into graduate school and making the transition, and challenges faced by women in STEM, among others.</p>\n<p>Student outcomes, as well as specific program elements, were evaluated by an independent evaluator using a combination of surveys and focus-group interviews.

Similarly, 93% of the students responded with a 3 or above (87% answered 4 or above) when asked about the likelihood that they would apply to graduate school. An important objective for the MIV-REU program is to increase students' confidence and science identity. When comparing pre- and post-test responses, 2021 MIV-REU students reported positive gains in science identity and confidence (see Figure 2). When asked if they were \"comfortable identifying myself as a scientist\" the students' responses increased 25% after completing the program (from an average of 3.25 to 4 on a 5-point scale), while the students' response increased over 10% (from 3.7 to 4.2) when asked the question \"I identify as a scientist\".
