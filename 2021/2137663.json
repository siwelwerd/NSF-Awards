An intriguing phenomenon in biomineralization is the incorporation of organic molecules into a growing crystal, which profoundly alters the mineral\u2019s macroscopic properties and function. Proteins are known to play a critical role in controlling mineral formation, while the impact of sugars is yet poorly understood. By using well-defined model systems, this research will advance our fundamental understanding of polysaccharide-mineral interactions. Transferring biological construction principles to industrial processes has the potential to benefit practical applications, such as the environmentally friendly synthesis of fracture-resistant ceramics that emulate mineralized structures in nature. Progress in this area will benefit diverse disciplines, including but not limited to materials science, polymer chemistry, nanotechnology, geosciences, or biomedical engineering. Specific examples include the mineral-catalyzed sugar synthesis on meteorites or pathological mineralization processes in the human body. The principal investigator aims at broadening the participation of under-represented minorities, women and K-12 students in STEM through educational outreach activities. Early research engagement of students from minority-serving institutions is intended to create a pipeline for STEM talent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAn intriguing phenomenon in biogenic minerals is the inclusion of organic matter into a growing crystal, which has important implications for the material\u2019s macroscopic properties. Prior investigations have revealed that intracrystalline proteins play a critical role in controlling mineral formation. However, the role of polysaccharides in regulating biomineralization is not well established at present, although they occur frequently in biologically produced crystals and often constitute a large portion of the organic-mineral interphase. The main objective of the proposed research is to address this knowledge gap by investigating the role that carbohydrates play in mineralization. The proposed work will focus on in vitro model systems based on naturally occurring minerals and polysaccharides, which closely mimic fundamental interactions of the organic matrix in living organisms, while eliminating the complexity and heterogeneity associated with living systems. Single crystals with polysaccharide inclusions will be prepared by a slow diffusion method and analyzed for their hierarchical structure and chemical composition using a combination of electron microscopy, vibrational spectroscopy, and X-ray scattering. The study will give insights into the mechanism of polysaccharide incorporation into crystals, and the relationship between chemical composition, structural organization, and crystallographic orientation. This research further seeks to develop sustainable synthesis protocols that emulate carbohydrate-mineralized structures in the biosphere. This project intends to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities, women and K-12 students through outreach activities. Specifically, the PI intends to develop a new course and online learning module on Biomineralization for integrating STEM education and research. The PI is planning to organize a crystal summer school for middle school students from minority-serving institutions. High school and undergraduate students will be offered learning opportunities through faculty-mentored academic and summer research projects on bioinspired mineralization.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
