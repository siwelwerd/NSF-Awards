 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  project will create a new pathway to engage and retain a diverse group of Baltimore City high school students in the geosciences through a collaboration between the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences (EPS) and The Ingenuity Project (IP), a Baltimore City non-profit that has developed an academic program to prepare and launch the next generation of diverse Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math leaders. The project will enhance the geoscience learning of high school students through place-based learning geoscience activities and research projects, including measuring and monitoring the environmental conditions in Baltimore City. Specifically, students will participate in active research projects aimed at quantifying heat, air, water, and soil pollution across Baltimore and will learn about the intersection of environmental monitoring and social justice initiatives. Together, this will establish a learning ecosystem in which there are increased opportunities for underrepresented minority high school students to engage in geoscience activities and in which the geosciences are viewed as an exciting and relevant field of study with viable career paths. \r\n\r\nThe  goals of the project are to (1) increase the number of high school students engaging in activities and research within JHU EPS, (2) increase the engagement of JHU EPS in Baltimore environmental initiatives, including working with and educating local high school students on these issues, (3) engage students in hands-on placed-based learning research opportunities that demonstrate the interdisciplinary nature of geoscience research, and (4) expose students to the intersection between environmental and social justice issues in Baltimore City. These goals will be achieved through a three-pronged approach with multiple entry points for engaging students to participate in geosciences research: 1) an end-of-summer Geosciences Camp, 2) EPS faculty and graduate student presentations in IP classrooms, and 3) IP Research Practicum in JHU EPS labs. These activities will increase the knowledge of Baltimore City high school students on geoscience problems and research, it\u2019s societal relevance, and career pathways in the geosciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
