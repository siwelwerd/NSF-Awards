 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support student travel to the 2021 New Security Paradigms Workshop to be held in New Hampshire, in October 2021. The New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW) provides a stimulating, safe, and highly interactive forum for innovative approaches to computer security. NSPW encourages graduate students and junior faculty to examine long-held ideas within computer security. It also strongly encourages non-computer security experts from economics, sociology, psychology, and other disciplines to bring their expertise to bear on computer security paradigms. The support from NSF will be used to sponsor travel expenses for graduate students and junior faculty to attend the workshop. Supporting junior researchers' travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The project\u2019s broader significance and importance lie in training the next generation of researchers in this important research area.\r\n\r\nThe NSPW special emphasis area this year is interdisciplinarity and translation zones in the context of emerging technologies. Computer systems are not designed to support security. They are designed to perform some function, whether that is banking, grades, writing, or communication. Applying security principles to systems with consideration of those other principles is both interdisciplinary in nature and crucial to aligning incentives between system users and security needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
