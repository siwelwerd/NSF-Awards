 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. The sustainability of STEM instructional capacity gains is significantly enhanced by retaining the talent of credentialed STEM faculty. This project aligns directly with that goal. \r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused major disruptions to institutions of higher education. For tribal colleges and universities, whose core operating funds are directly aligned with student enrollment, drops in enrollment equate to loss of funding. To mitigate against detrimental pandemic-related effects on STEM instructional capacity, this award will support the salary and professional development of one full-time STEM faculty member at Chief Dull Knife College. This TCUP STEM Faculty award is intended to help maintain Chief Dull Knife College\u2019s STEM program as the college recovers from the deleterious impact of the pandemic.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n As a recipient of federal STEM program funding for nearly 20 years, CDKC has leveraged resources to create institutional change that sustains its students progressing through the STEM pipeline. NSF funding has supported reform in the delivery of mathematics and science courses and through the creation of a science internship culture that has produced associates, bachelors, and masters degrees. Investments in CDKC and its primarily Northern Cheyenne student population have created opportunities for math, science and technology experiences in courses and research participation that bring dividends to both the local community and the larger science and engineering field.\r\n\n\n An important element of these programs is the commitment to maintaining adequate faculty to carry out the program. The sustained focus on collaboration has made CDKC a sought- after partner in many science and engineering arenas. Faculty and staff recognized early that creating relationships with university faculty, science practitioners, and other experts built the social capital networks that many Native American students lack in academic settings away from the reservation. Math and science faculty have long-standing collaborative research projects with University of Montana, Montana State University at Bozeman, Carroll College, and others. We were in urgent need of keeping faculty in their current roles in a post-Covid world. All of our STEM endeavors were in danger if we were not able to keep our vitally necessary STEM faculty.\r\n\n\n CDKC faculty found projects that allowed its TCU students to understand why science, and by extension science skills, were important in their community. CDKC faculty and staff recognize that its students need experiences with science, technology, and engineering both on and off the reservation in order to successfully pursue careers. Progress with students is a slow building venture to bring students to the matriculation point with other higher education partners.  \r\n\n\n Native American student potential in science, engineering, and technology is evident. Dedicated faculty and researchers at CDKC provide the mini-bridge that our students need to prepare for the next level of academic experiences.Retention of qualified faculty in combination with increased research opportunities for students and summer outreach have produced our largest cohort of potential and identified STEM students ever. We know that close integration of that research with classroom study and community relevant topics is a likely mechanism for increasing student comprehension of the STEM concepts.
