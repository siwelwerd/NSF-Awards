 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project lies in an innovative antiviral coating to improve personal protective equipment (PPE).  Given the high transmissibility of COVID-19, it is critical to manage contagion though substantive improvements to PPE, especially face masks. The proposed antiviral composition will significantly reduce spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, starting with surgical face masks.  This can help reduction of other surface-based pathogens as well.  \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a formulation that exhibits antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and can be applied to N95 masks without disrupting filtration requirements. To accomplish this, the company proposes to develop fourteen optimized formulations that will be tested on N95 masks using the company\u2019s ultrasonic spray coating technology. Eight formulations that exhibit acceptable spray coating parameters will be tested in viral challenge studies with H1N1 flu virus. The four formulations with highest antiviral activity will be further tested with relevant viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
