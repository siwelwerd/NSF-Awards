 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support of the Divisions of Chemistry, and Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems, and the Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation Division, the GEM Consortium aims to improve diversity in the STEM workforce through a two-pronged approach. First, GEM encourages selected underrepresented minority (URM) students to pursue graduate degrees in STEM fields by ensuring that the students receive a living stipend and tuition while enrolled in a GEM member-university program. Next, GEM provides access to paid internships for the selected students, providing the students with work experience and networking opportunities. Ultimately this project works to illustrate and provide pathways for advanced STEM education and careers for URM students. Promoting progress in science and building a globally competitive workforce, a core part of the National Science Foundation's mission, requires increasing diversity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). \r\n\r\nThis project provides training pathways for both Ph.D. and Master's level students in the STEM fields of Chemistry, Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Transport and Fluid Mechanical Engineering, and Civil and Mechanical Engineering. GEM consortium-selected URM students apply to the university-member programs, and upon acceptance, GEM provides a stipend towards living expenses and tuition. The universities cover the remainder of the tuition, and in the case of Ph.D. level students, a living stipend (through teaching or research assistantships or other methods) for the duration of the degree. This encourages member universities to accept URM students, while assuring students of the economic feasibility of an advanced degree. A total of 52 students will be supported through this effort. These students also participate in a paid internship that GEM helps to arrange, which enables students to build a career network and provides them with work experience. These students and others supported through GEM will be part of a long term evaluation on the effectiveness of this approach.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
