 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microbes live in complex communities throughout the environment, but it remains unclear how specific microbes become members or maintain their role in these communities. This project will explore how bacteria and fungi use chemicals they produce to interact with one another and their environment. The bacteria and fungi in this project are all derived from the remarkably stable communities of microbes that inhabit cheese rinds that are consumed around the world. Currently, there is a poor understanding of how the chemicals bacteria and fungi produce on fermented foods stabilize or destabilize the roles of the members of their communities. In the short term, this project will identify key chemicals and processes that bacteria and fungi use to interact with one another on cheese rinds. In the long term, studying these microbes will give insight into the key processes bacteria and fungi use to operate within a community. The key processes used in this relatively simple system will be extended to other complex systems to explore how microbes use their own chemistry to affect other members in their communities.  The project will create a series of K-12 outreach modules, which will raise awareness of the biochemical and microbial contributions nutritional foods.  Additional broader impacts is the training of undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nMultispecies microbial communities (microbiomes) are important drivers of global ecosystems, human and animal health, and food production, but our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive the formation of these communities remains a significant gap in knowledge. A contributing factor to this gap is the fact that few biological systems are available where in situ microbial communities can be deconstructed and experimentally recreated in the lab. Because of the challenges in manipulating microbiomes, very little is known about the genetic and chemical basis of species interactions. Bacteria and fungi are known to produce and dedicate a large part of their genetic material to the production of specialized metabolites. However, many of the pathways remain cryptic or have yet to be discovered because they have not been implicated in bioactivity screening. In this project innovative mass spectrometry techniques will be combined with microbial genetic and genomic techniques and a novel model community system to determine the molecular mechanisms of species interactions and how these interactions shape the formation and stability of microbial communities. This research will uncover conserved genetic pathways that underlie microbial interactions and their accompanying metabolites.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We explored a variety of fungi in pairwise comparison with two different bacterial species, one a native cheese rind microbe, the other a model of a food invader. We had initially hypothesized that the bacteria would drive the community and that we would be able to measure this on both a genetic level and chemical level via the small molecules that bacteria are known to make. We did indeed find that bacteria have a conversed set of responses to their fungal partners including the acquisition of trace elements such as iron and cell wall stresses. The bacteria also had some niche responses dependent on the fungal partner. Interestingly, we observed a functional redundancy (based on the purported functions in the literature) of small chemicals the majority of the fungi produced that we were able to detect. As a specific example, we measured fungal compounds that can chelate iron and found that bacteria that were modified to be unable to make comparable compounds, were able to utilize the fungal products instead for survival. This highlights that microbiomes likely have cooperation as a feature when it comes to publicly available chemical goods. This was further confirmed by our observation that there is a decrease in free chelators in the presence of these co-cultures which may indicate they are being utilized by both organisms. We have also measured and isolated fungal chemicals that have been previously demonstrated to have antibacterial, insecticidal and some anticancer activity. We have contributed our data to publicly available databases, specifically databases that seek to link the information from genomes and metabolomes so they we can continue to learn and increase annotations from these rich datasets. Based on our findings, fungi are major producers of functional chemistry in the cheese rind microbiome. In learning from our work, our future directions will involve measuring synergy from these bioactive metabolites and developing ways in which we can test how altering the fungal metabolome impacts community composition and whether this extends to other microbiomes outside of the cheese rind.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/28/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Laura&nbsp;Sanchez</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2128044/2128044_10560207_1666986051695_Zn-Copro3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2128044/2128044_10560207_1666986051695_Zn-Copro3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Zink coproporphyrin III\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2128044/2128044_10560207_1666986051695_Zn-Copro3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Zink coproporphyrin III\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Imaging mass spectrometry of a Glutamicibater producing Zinc coproporphyrin III in co-culture with a fungal species.
