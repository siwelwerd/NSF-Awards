 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today we are entirely dependent on centralized infrastructures (aka Cloud) for pretty much all our everyday activities such as online education, neighborhood apps, access to driving directions, and restaurant suggestions in a neighborhood. This reliance on the Cloud has serious implications. Most importantly it is one of the primary causes for the increasing digital divide between the affluent and under\u00acserved communities. The thesis of this proposal is that such reliance on a centralized infrastructure is the bane of under\u00acserved communities blocking them from reaping the benefits of information services that are available at the fingertips of residents in affluent communities. Ubiquitous availability of low-cost software services that are tailored to the needs of the community and pertinent to the local conditions without reliance on the Cloud are key factors in enhancing the capabilities of such communities. The key hypothesis to be validated through the planning grant is the power of edge computing to address the digital divide and future\u00acproof these under\u00acserved urban communities. The findings from the planning grant will help reveal feasible technological interventions for future\u00acproofing under\u00acserved urban communities from the digital divide. There is promise that the results of this research could be replicated elsewhere leading to a positive impact on the lives of under-served communities nation\u00acwide, if the hypotheses of the larger research vision is validated by the data collection being done through this planning grant.\r\n\r\nUsing the Westside communities of Atlanta as an exemplar for under\u00acserved urban neighborhoods, the planning grant wishes to carry out the following pilots along the technology dimension: (a) edge\u00accompute based video\u00acconferencing solutions for the residents of the community (e.g., for meetings of the stakeholders, tutoring help for students, etc.) \u037e (b) edge\u00accompute based smart prefetching of content pertinent to the needs of the residents (e.g., entertainment, videos and presentations pertaining to school work, etc.) \u037e and (c) ad hoc connectivity solutions to bring WiFi hotspots to different neighborhoods. Along the societal dimension, the project will recruit participants (about 30) representing different demographic groups (such as community leaders, teachers, students, mentors, and local residents) for using the technology pilots. The data collection from the user group will consist of: (a) general understanding of the pressing needs of the community\u037e (b) specific requirements of the focus groups for identifying the types of content to be prefetched and/or cached in the edge nodes\u037e and (c) user experience on the technology pilots.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
