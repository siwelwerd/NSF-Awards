 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Bioplastics and Biocomposites (CB2) at Iowa State University (ISU), University of Georgia (UGA), Washington State University (WSU), and North Dakota State University (NDSU) seeks to develop and build on an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) that focuses on bioplastics and biocomposites. The mission of CB2 is to develop fundamental knowledge related to bioplastics and biocomposites, to disseminate research-based findings to industry to promote sustainability, and to educate future scientists and engineers. As such, there is an expressed industrial interest in leveraging research efforts to accelerate systematic development of standardized material and processing data for these novel plastics and composites. The center focusses on the development of jobs in the area of sustainable manufacturing and the conversion of agricultural and woody crops to bio-based materials that contribute to job creation in the United States. The center also strives to support education and diversity through engagement of undergraduate and graduate students in research on sustainable materials. \r\n\r\nThe goal of CB2 is to improve the basic knowledge of synthesis, processing, properties, and compounding of bioplastic and biocomposite materials, to develop reliable materials characteristics data for industrial partners, and to support large-scale industrial implementation of renewable materials. The vision of the center is to develop knowledge that will facilitate the production of an array of high-value products, including plastics, coatings, adhesives, and composites, from renewable feedstocks.  The materials are compatible with current industrial manufacturing systems and promote rural development as well as national growth. The goals of the Phase II are fourfold: 1) expand the knowledge and develop the science for recycling and end of life treatment of sustainable materials, in particular as they are mixed with petrochemical plastics; 2) expand membership by engaging new companies that have expressed a need for recycling and end of life treatment; 3) develop fundamental knowledge on sustainable materials; 4) prepare students to join the workforce equipped with the knowledge and skills required by industry. The team of researchers includes experts in the fields of polymer processing, polymer chemistry, materials science, and crop utilization. UGA\u2019s research focuses on end-of-life assessment, plant biomass valorization, coatings and adhesives, and polymers for various industry applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
