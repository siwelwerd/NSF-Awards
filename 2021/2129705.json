 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority populations(African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians or Alaska Natives, NativeHawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders) to successfully complete high-quality degree programs in STEM. Chicago State University will lead an Organizing Committee to develop and hold a Principal Investigators/Project Directors (PI/PD) meeting. \r\n\r\nThe conference will take place in a hybrid format over two days at the beginning of October, with both in-person attendance and virtual attendance at all the in-person sessions. The meeting will provide a forum for discussing the accomplishments of the program over the last 30 years, as well as the challenges and opportunities going forward, especially in light of COVID19 impacts. All LSAMP PIs and PDs will be invited to the meeting. As the last LSAMP PI/PD meeting was held in 2019, this meeting will provide the opportunity to foster and renew connections, to share information and resources gained in addressing pandemic-related issues, and plot a course going forward for the LSAMP community to meet the challenges of post-pandemic academia for groups underrepresented in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
