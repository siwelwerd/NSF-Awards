 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support research on the dynamics and gravitational wave emission of compact binary systems in general relativity.  The numerous observations by LIGO and Virgo of merging stellar mass black holes and neutron stars over the last five years have opened up the era of gravitational wave astronomy.  These events reveal new astrophysics, including confirming the site of heavy element formation, discovering a new class of intermediate mass black holes, and providing novel tests of general relativity theory. These observations also motivate development of the LISA space-based detector and raise prospects for eventual gravitational wave observations of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs).  EMRIs involve a stellar-mass black hole (or neutron star or white dwarf) spiraling into a supermassive black hole (which are known to exist in the center of virtually all large galaxies).  Surrounded by dense star clusters, these supermassive black holes will frequently capture compact stars into highly eccentric orbits.  As these compact stars orbit, they radiate gravitational waves, causing the orbit to decay and the compact object to eventually be swallowed by the supermassive black hole (or potentially tidally disrupted in the case of white dwarfs). The emitted gravitational radiation will be observable with LISA.  The theoretical work funded by this award will provide improved predictions of the expected signals from highly-eccentric compact merging binaries.  The US is a leader in gravitational wave astronomy and these theoretical activities support future extensions of such observations.  Detection of gravitational waves from EMRIs will provide unique strong field tests of gravity and probe the nature of black holes, while also uncovering astrophysical properties of the dense central regions of galaxies.\r\n\r\nTo pursue this effort, development will be made of new techniques in black hole perturbation theory and gravitational self-force methods, along with writing associated advanced computer codes.  Symbolic mathematical calculations of black hole perturbation theory and the gravitational self-force will be made to high order in the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion for eccentric EMRIs.  These calculations will be extended to EMRIs with general orbits about a rotating (Kerr) primary.  These high PN order perturbation and self-force findings support and reinforce broader efforts to advance PN theory and provide calibrations of effective-one-body models of merging binaries. The PI's group draws upon their experience in recent years with a fully symbolic code that was specialized to Schwarzschild EMRIs to now write a fully symbolic code for Kerr EMRIs.  Generated gravitational wave flux and self-force data will be incorporated in adiabatic and post-adiabatic inspiral calculations to provide accurate waveforms for much of an EMRI's evolution. Some parts of this work will be conducted in collaboration with former students and with colleagues at University College Dublin.  Results and some computer codes will be made available online.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis award funded research into several areas of gravitational physics theory related to gravitational waves and black hole binaries. Projects included making high-order post-Newtonian (PN) expansions of various first-order gravitational self-force quantities in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), studying the self-force in resonant EMRI orbits, modeling numerically extended-body dynamics in general relativity, and calculating relativistic stellar pulsations.\n\n\nIntellectual merit: The primary intellectual focus was on using black hole perturbation theory and self-force calculations to understand EMRIs--binaries where one black hole is much more massive than its companion. EMRIs are expected to be a key source of gravitational waves that will be observable by LISA--the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. The grant research focused on EMRIs with eccentric and inclined orbits, motivated by astrophysical expectations on how such systems may form in distant galactic nuclei. One study adopted a scalar field model for EMRI dynamics, calculating back-reaction on a scalar charged body orbiting a Kerr black hole. The work showed that the conservative part of the scalar self-force produces a secular evolution of the Carter constant during polar-radial resonances. The result is that conservative perturbations are non-integrable through a resonance. Three other studies drew upon a set of Mathematica codes that were developed to make purely symbolic high-order post-Newtonian calculations in first-order perturbation theory. These codes make novel use of Mathematica by running the calculations on a supercomputer, computing up to hundreds of Fourier-harmonic modes of the perturbation problem simultaneously. The results of the calculations were analytic expressions for self-force quantities, like the gravitational wave fluxes at the horizon and local gauge invariants such as the redshift and spin precession. The computed expressions were high-order expansions both in post-Newtonian order and in eccentricity e. The redshift invariant and the horizon fluxes (black hole tidal heating and torquing) were both computed, for example, to 10PN relative order and to the 20th power in e, yielding expansions far beyond the previous state-of-the-art. The high-order expansions in eccentricity allow numerical evaluations of our expressions to be accurate even up to moderately high eccentricity (e.g., e ~ 0.7). Most previous work had gone no further than the 4th or 6th power in e, largely restricting the results to nearly circular orbits. The horizon fluxes computed in this project, along with our previously calculated fluxes at infinity, were then used by others to calculate long term inspirals of eccentric EMRIs. A fifth study involved extending the redshift invariant calculation to EMRIs with a Kerr primary. Finally, effort was also devoted to developing a finite element code to model dynamics of extended elastic bodies in general relativity and, separately, to modeling relativistic corrections to stellar pulsations.\n\n\nBroader impacts: This project had several broader impacts. The theoretical work on the self-force and black hole binaries contributes indirectly to experimental efforts, since it helps allow early-phase waveforms to be computed, which can factor in to expectations for LISA observations and guide development of fast waveform generators. Secondly, the Mathematica codes for doing high-order fully symbolic perturbation theory may find broader uses in other areas of gravity theory and outside general relativity. Thirdly, results were disseminated using the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit (BHPTK) website (bhptoolkit.org), which we helped found and develop. Finally, funding served to train, to educate, and to continue to mentor five then-current and former graduate students, four of whom have obtained postdoctoral or permanent positions.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CharlesREvans\n"
