It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution. and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. The project at Clinton College has been designed to develop a Recognition Applications of Visualization and Evaluation (RAVE) program that will assess and develop mathematics skills of freshmen at the institution.  Clinton College\u2019s implementation of its the RAVE program will support ongoing work that explores the elements of effective programming in mathematics-based summer bridge programs that corresponds to increased enrollment, retention, and graduation of students that major in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs.\r\n\r\nThe RAVE program will consist of four different activities.  The activities include:  (1) the establishment of a summer bridge program that utilizes the emporium model-student engagement with technology via computer-based learning modules and focus on visualization of mathematical concepts and data; (2) the revision of curricula for entry-level gateway math courses (College Math I and II) to incorporate the emporium model; (3) the synthesis of revised, module-based mathematics instruction, goal-setting and planning skill-building instruction, and co-curricular activities to introduce students to the infrastructure of support systems on campus; and (4) the development of  faculty and peer-mentoring programs.  The activities will allow student participants to assess and bolster their skills in mathematics and computer program literacy while operating within a cohort construct, and with the advantage of early access to, and corresponding familiarity with, the campus and faculty.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
