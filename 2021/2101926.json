 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parasitic insects have a global impact on human health, livestock production, and wildlife conservation. Building robust datasets of parasites\u2019 host preferences, seasonal activity, and geographic range can help scientists and public health professionals understand and predict patterns of disease transmission; however, much of the data needed for these assessments is accessible only through museum collections. The primary goal of this project is to extract this data from a world-class collection of fleas and associated parasites at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History (CMNH). As part of the Terrestrial Parasite Tracker Thematic Collections Network (TPT TCN), high-quality specimen images and host/locality data will be captured, digitized, and shared via public data portals. This will allow entomologists, epidemiologists, and other researchers to make essential connections between disease vectors and their host species. In turn, understanding these connections will support future assessments of economic and health risks from insect-vectored disease. \r\n\r\nThe Robert Traub flea collection at CMNH is one of the largest and most meticulously curated collections of mammal parasites in the world, with 74,897 specimens mounted under glass on 60,596 glass slides with 4,615 associated genitalic dissections. This project will use automated slide scanning technology developed for pathology laboratory use to capture whole-slide and specimen images efficiently. These images will then be linked with digitized host and locality data from both slide labels and Traub\u2019s fieldwork logs. This project will more than quintuple the Siphonaptera specimen records for the Terrestrial Parasite Tracker TCN and complete its representation of flea families. This will represent a valuable dataset and image resource not just for TPT TCN and epidemiology research, but for systematic research on Siphonaptera in general. Disseminating this data through the online data portals, including iDigBio.org, Symbiota Collection of Arthropods Network (SCAN), and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).  Broad digital access will enable researchers and diagnosticians worldwide to access an enormous database of host-parasite relationships as well as to compare their specimens to high-quality specimen images with reliable species-level identifications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Because these disease-vectoring parasites are ubiquitous among pets, livestock, and wildlife, understanding their distribution, seasonality, and host breadth stands to benefit human and animal health research on a global scale. This project also aimed to share research-grade specimen images to aid in identification; this is particularly urgent because the number of active experts in this field has dwindled significantly over the last decade, and fewer taxonomists are now available to provide diagnostic support for fleas. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This grant supported the acquisition of a high-quality digital slide imaging system for the section of Invertebrate Zoology at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History (CMNH). This device was used to capture high-resolution images of 337 species in 175 genera of fleas (as well as specimen labels, e.g. Fig. 2), which are now available to the public on the CMNH Invertebrate Zoology website (<a href=\"http://www.invertebratezoology.org\">www.invertebratezoology.org</a>). The imaged specimens include many rare and unusual flea species for which it is difficult to find data or illustrations. These images have already been used to support graduate research in parasitology at several external institutions, as well as to help illustrate the newly published systematic review and identification key for all 316 species of fleas known from North America (Lewis and Eckerlin 2024). The combination of these images and the keys now available will provide invaluable identification tools freely available for use worldwide.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to data from slides, this project also captured data from collecting events. Over the life of this award, staff and work-study students at CMNH transcribed over 30,000 collection records from Robert Traub&rsquo;s field notebooks, spanning three decades of fieldwork across the globe. After removal of negative or ambiguous results, this transcribed dataset produced 17,885 records of collecting events. In order to split each collecting event into a single-species record, CMNH staff developed a data-cleaning tool (Fig. 3, the Flea Data Game) to streamline the process of updating species names and place names (many of which have changed in the 30-60 years since they were first recorded). Using this tool, 3,566 records have been separated to date. CMNH has exported a pilot dataset of 2281 single-species collecting records with valid species names and updated localities to GBIF (gbif.org/dataset/b1090b9a-ac3f-4fdc-ba77-c51228ca8754); this is also available on the GloBI database (<a href=\"https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/cmnh-izc\">github.com/globalbioticinteractions/cmnh-izc</a>). As additional records are refined through the cleaning tool, they will be added in batches to GBIF and GloBI.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to the intellectual contributions listed above, this project also supported the training of nine work-study undergraduate students in entomology and microscopy. Lessons from the digitization process and novel slide photography methods used in this project were shared with other researchers in workshops and meetings, including the 2022 TPT PEN meeting and workshop, the Illinois Natural History Survey in 2023, and an iDigBio workshop at CMNH in 2024. In January 2023, PI Seago used images and information from this project to develop and deliver a workshop for educators at the grade 6-12 level, focusing on ecology, symbioses, and trophic relationships at the miniature scale. These materials have since been refined for use as part of the museum&rsquo;s traveling education program, designed for students who may not be able to visit CMNH in person.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>LITERATURE CITED</p>\n<p>Lewis, R.
