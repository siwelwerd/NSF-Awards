 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project that is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation\u2019s Directorate of Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (UKRI/NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement. This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget and the investigators associated with its own investigators and component of the work.\r\n\r\nThis research addresses the influence of reactive halogens on the oxidation capacity (the reactivity) of the atmosphere. A measurement campaign will be conducted at the BIOS Tudor Hill Marine Atmospheric Observatory in Bermuda to measure reactive gaseous halogens (bromine, chlorine, and iodine species) and their aerosol-phase counterparts. The results of this research will improve the process level representation of reactive halogen chemistry in atmospheric chemical transport models, increasing the ability to accurately predict the concentrations of pollutants such as ozone in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe observations supported by this effort will include what are expected to be the most abundant reactive gaseous bromine, chlorine, and iodine species (HCl, BrO, ClNO2, IO, among several others) and their aerosol-phase counterparts (Br-, Cl-, I-) from which the gas-phase species are derived. For gas-phase species, three different observational techniques (CIMS, LP-DOAS, TILDAS) will be employed, allowing for comparison of the measurements of some key reactive halogens while also expanding the suite of measured halogen species. A chemically detailed representation of the halogen chemistry will be included into the GEOS-Chem model as part of this project. This project will support three U.S. graduate students and one U.K. graduate student, providing these students with experience in field work, global modeling, and international collaboration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
