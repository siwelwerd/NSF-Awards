 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a lifesaving hemorrhage control device designed based on surgeon feedback on current methods for hemorrhage control. Current methods for addressing some hemorrhages include can involve interrupting blood supply to large portions of the abdomen and all of the lower extremities. Complications can result from the removal of these occlusion methods.  This proposed device has the potential to improve the associated morbidity and mortality of hemorrhage in the US (and globally), and reduce the costs associated with complications while impacting the success of hemorrhage intervention.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a resuscitative endovascular bypass, which is a temporary stent that rapidly and effectively occludes vessels and controls hemorrhage in a specific region while allowing blood flow to the remainder of the body. Compared to all current methods of occlusion, this proposed device increases the time frame within which physicians may address injuries and save a patient, while reducing risk of perfusion related complications. The proposed technology is designed to effectively address the reduction of blood volume without compromising blood supply to vital organs and tissues necessary for the patient\u2019s survival.  The device may be used seamlessly in an active trauma situation without compromising the outcome of the patient, as compared with current methods.  In addition, this device also has the potential to be utilized in a number of other applications, including localized extremity hemorrhage, as well as in additional care settings including field and military trauma.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
