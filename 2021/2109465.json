 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Coral reefs, essential elements of the global ecosystem, depend on solar-powered symbioses: algae live inside marine reef animals, such as coral and giant clams, and photosynthesize to provide ready energy. However, increasingly environmental changes jeopardize the balance that maintains these animal-algal symbioses. To protect critically-threatened reefs worldwide, we face a powerful imperative to (i) explore how reef animals harness solar power so efficiently and (ii) understand threats to their intricate solar. In this project, the fellow will research optical adaptations and evolution in reef-dwelling symbiotic animals.  The results will help us understand why corals bleach so severely while other symbiotic marine animals do not. Along the way, the innate creativity of nature may inspire sustainable technologies for solar power. \r\n\r\nThrough three projects, the fellow will explore the following rule of life: how do animal hosts and their symbionts partner together to harness solar energy? In Project 1, the fellow will research whether photosymbiotic acoels and anemones have adaptations to channel light toward their symbionts, and if so whether these adaptations resemble light-harnessing structures seen in other organisms (such as plants). As a result, this work will set the stage for comparative evolutionary analyses as well as, potentially, inspiring new solar panel research. In Project 2, the fellow will test hypotheses about what selective forces drive diversity in biophotonic structures (from Project 1) and colors across acoels and anemones. For example, are environmental influences\u2014such as depth\u2014less important than symbiotic pressures\u2014such as species of symbiont?  In Project 3, the fellow will analyze why some animals are so susceptible to bleaching while others are resistant. Specifically, I will assess whether certain biophotonic adaptations that concentrate light for photosynthetic could actually exacerbate bleaching \u2013 potentially by causing organisms to heat up, or experience light shock, amidst warming waters. The fellow will learn and apply cutting-edge microscopy, applied physics, and materials science methods to marine biology (including hyperspectral imaging, transmission electron microscopy, and finite-difference time-domain simulations).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

They feed millions of people, prevent coastal erosion, and support a huge amount of marine life. Coral reefs depend on solar-powered symbioses: algae live inside marine reef animals, such as coral and giant clams, and photosynthesize to provide ready energy. These solar-powered partnerships help coral reefs fulfill their role as pillars of marine life. However, as waters warm, corals bleach: they expel their symbiotic algae, turn white, and often die. Coral bleaching is an ecological catastrophe, and we must better understand these solar-powered symbioses in order to conserve and protect reefs worldwide. In addition, solar-powered symbioses are a fascinating topic of research: symbiosis and photosynthesis are two fundamental building blocks of life on earth. In this project, we tackled two main goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Understand the physics of light in solar-powered symbiosis.</strong> How do corals and bivalves differ in their approach to using physical structures to focus, screen, or concentrate light on their symbionts?</li>\n<li><strong>Investigate the causes of bleaching.</strong> Why are some animals, such as certain corals, so susceptible to bleaching while others are resistant? Do certain biophotonic adaptations that concentrate light for photosynthesis actually exacerbate bleaching through increasing light stress?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We investigated physics in a strange reef-dwelling clam relative called the heart cockle (<em>Corculum cardissa </em>and <em>spp.</em>). Just like corals, heart cockles have photosynthetic algae living inside their bodies. How do you let sunlight irradiate your symbiotic algae if you are a hard-shelled clam? We showed that heart cockles have evolved transparent windows in their shells with what is, to our knowledge, the first example of bundled fiber optic cables in a living creature. We used methods from materials science to fully analyze these remarkable shell windows. Unlike corals, they screen out damaging UV wavelengths of light, potentially protecting their symbionts against light stress. Perhaps this explains why corals bleach so severely while other organisms do not: perhaps light stress plays a role. In addition, the heart cockles&rsquo; fiber optic cables and microlenses may inspire new optical technologies. Our paper presenting these results is currently under review (McCoy et al. under review).</p>\n<p>To test corals&rsquo; resilience, we traveled to Palau to gather data on the light environment in coral reefs and to conduct experiments on how five different species of wild coral respond to light stress and heat stress. We worked at the Palau International Coral Reef Center. We provided a proof-of-concept demonstration that corals do bleach given greater amounts of light stress, but that the pace and likelihood of bleaching depends on the specific light-harnessing architecture of the coral. Specifically, we analyzed five coral species from three different reef sites: <em>Porites lobata, Porites cylindrica, Acropora digitifera, Pocillopora verrucosa, </em>and <em>Acropora hyacinthus</em>. When raised in three tanks that varied in how much sunlight irradiated the corals, overall, corals were more likely to bleach when exposed to greater amounts of sunlight. However, the pace of bleaching varied by species. In addition, we observed qualitative evidence that certain regions of the coral were self-shaded and therefore prevented from bleaching.

Here, we explored the physics of photosynthetic symbiosis in little-understood reef-dwelling animals called the heart cockles. We found that heart cockles evolved windows in their shell with a suite of intricate photonic adaptations, screening out UV radiation but letting in sunlight for photosynthesis. Further, we showed that five coral species in Palau vary in their susceptibility to bleaching from light stress.

This insight may suggest new conservation strategies, either through physical shading or through genetic engineering to resist light stress. Further, the photonic architecture we observed in living creatures may inspire new technologies.
