 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marco Muzio is awarded an NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at the Pennsylvania State University.  Muzio will use multi-messenger astronomy, combining neutrino, gamma-ray, and particle detection to study the highest energy events. Specifically, Muzio will use data from the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) to perform new, higher sensitivity studies related to very high-energy (VHE) neutrinos above approximately 10 Petaelectronvolts. Along with the research, Muzio will work with the Climate and Diversity Committee and others at the university to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities at both the postdoctoral and undergraduate levels. \r\n \r\nDetection of VHE neutrinos will address pressing questions in the study of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays, including how their sources are distributed, what their composition is, and if accelerators produce a substantial flux at energies at length scales inaccessible through cosmic ray observations. Importantly, neutrinos will address these questions in a hadronic interaction model-independent way, sidestepping particle physics uncertainties that plague the interpretation of cosmic ray data.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
