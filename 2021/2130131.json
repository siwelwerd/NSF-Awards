 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an artificial extracellular matrix (aECM) for the treatment of traumatic injuries and wound healing. The proposed material may lead to more effective scaffolds and may be crafted to attach to any given substrate. Complex aECM microspheres may be inserted into a hydrogel-type design or attached to a larger structure, depending on the application. This proposed technology may reduce permanent secondary injuries commonly caused by traumatic injuries by providing stability to the damaged region. In addition, the use of an aECM in tandem with cell transplantation may encourage cell-to-cell interactions and ensure that the cell death that occurs post primary impact is minimized. If successful, the proposed materials may decrease patient recovery time and decrease cognitive loss in neuronal applications.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of peptoid microspheres to create an artificial extracellular matrix (aECM) to support growth of cells. A peptoid design with alternating charged and aromatic side chains allows for the self-assembly of microspheres via pi-stacking with diameters ranging from 1.5-3.5 microns in size. The microspheres are resistant to proteolysis making them more durable in vivo than peptide counterparts. Peptoid microspheres are suitable for use in aseptic conditions, as the spheres form in an 80% ethanol solution and sustain no structural deformities when exposed to ultraviolet-sterilization. The microspheres have been tested for toxicity with multiple cell types and have proven to be nontoxic.  In addition, in previous studies the topographical features have influenced the differentiation of neural stem cells to neurons and it was observed that cells arrange differently when the spheres are present in media. The versatility of this structure and promising initial results suggest that these microspheres incorporated into an artificial extracellular matrix may have applications in traumatic injury repair and wound healing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Throughout the project we interviewed over 100 customers, including those in wound dressing manufacturers, wound care clinics, hospitals, veterinary clinics, insurance companies, endodontists, surgeons, and more. One of the first things we learned is that our customers would prefer that the product be attached to the existing dressings that are used. We also learned that the market is oversaturated and we would be facing a large amount of competition. Our team changed direction to focus on veterinary care, specifically equine wound treatment. We learned that there is an unmet need for treatments to heal excessive granulation tissue in the lower limbs. These equine wounds are very similar to slow and non-healing wounds in humans, creating an ideal entry point to the market for a start-up. We identified new partners in equine wound care as well as potential distributors for the treatment.
