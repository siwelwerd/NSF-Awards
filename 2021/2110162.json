 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the CBET Environmental Engineering program with co-funding from the CBET Environmental Sustainability and the EEC Broadening Participation in Engineering programs supports the 2021 Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP) Research and Education Conference. The theme of the conference is \u201cEnvironmental Engineering and Science at the Confluence\u201d. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 AEESP Research and Education Conference was restructured around two events: 1) a virtual conference to be held on July 13-14, 2021 and 2) an in-person conference to be held on June 28-30, 2022 in St. Louis.  The AEESP 2021 virtual conference will feature various workshops and training events for environmental engineers/scientists at various stages of their careers including 1) an NSF CAREER proposal writing workshop for junior faculty, 2) a workshop on DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) to summarize and discuss the lessons learned from a series of webinars on \u201cConverging COVID-19, environment, health, and equity\u201d funded by the NSF CBET Environmental Engineering program, and 3) a technical workshop on aerosol science/engineering and public health with a focus on the COVID-19 pandemic. The AEESP 2022 in-person conference will also feature various workshops and training events organized around four areas of convergence:  convergence of education and research, convergence of research in air, water, and soil, convergence of research and action, and convergence of research, practice, and entrepreneurship. Both the virtual and in-person AEESP conferences will provide numerous opportunities for the participants to exchange ideas and build new partnerships. \r\n\r\nThe 2021/2022 AEESP Research and Education Conferences will be hosted by a group of academic institutions including Washington University in St. Louis (Lead Institution), Missouri University of Science & Technology, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, and the University of Missouri-Columbia. The biannual AEESP Research and Education Conference is the premier event for AEESP members  to exchange information on novel research, educational activities, and develop professional competencies. Key goals of the 2021/2022 AEESP conferences are to empower current and future environmental engineering and science (EES) professors to pursue the relevant \u201cNSF Big Ideas\u201d, catalyze convergence research and provide a forum for new perspectives and collaborations that will allow environmental engineers/scientists to apply their expertise and skills to address global and emerging societal Grand Challenges such as pandemic preparedness/prevention and climate change mitigation/adaptation. Both the 2021 virtual and  2022 in-person AEESP conferences seek to 1) broaden the participation of members of underrepresented groups in environmental engineering and science research and education; 2) empower the EES academic community to combat systemic racism; and 3) highlight research progress and identify new priority research directions. The 2021/2022 AEESP conferences will also provide speaking and networking opportunities for undergraduate/graduate students, and postdoctoral research fellows to inform the EES community of their research. Junior and prospective faculty members attending the conference will benefit from workshops devoted to NSF CAREER proposal writing, navigating the academic job search, and mentorship to broaden the participation of the EES community in NSF and federally-funded research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project supported activities that promoted the professional development of the environmental engineering and science academic community with broad participation through the 2022 Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP) Research and Education Conference.  The conference theme \"Environmental Engineering and Science at the Confluence\" focused on convergence.  Two separate events were hosted with the support of this conference grant.  The full in-person conference was held in St. Louis on the campus of Washington University on June 28-30, 2022 with 846 registered participants.  The conference included four platform events, twenty workshops, and two days of presentations with 320 oral presentations and 360 poster presentations.  When the originally planned 2021 in-person conference had to be postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a virtual \"appetizer\" meeting was holed on July14-15, 2021 with nearly 400 registered participants.  Both the virtual and in-person events offered a \"meet the candidate\" session for doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers who are entering the academic job market. \n\n \n\nA set of twenty half-day workshops were made possible with National Science Foundation.  These twenty workshops were categorized into those that provided (1) networking opportunities, (2) promotion of diversity, equity, and inclusion, (3) career support and development, (4) new tools for convergent research, (5) convergent education and outreach, and (4) data-enabled research and education.  Three half-day workshops focused specifically on building skills to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in environmental engineering and science research and education and combatting systemic racism.  A workshop on the development of NSF CAREER proposals for environmental engineering had 78 registered participants.  The most well-attended workshop (over 200 participants) was \"Careers in Environmental Engineering &amp; Science after Graduate School,\" which provided information and perspectives for graduate students and post-doctoral students regarding both academic and non-academic career paths. \n\n \n\nA substantial portion of the NSF conference support was used for travel grants that enabled the participation of people who might not otherwise have been able to attend the workshops and other conference events.  Fifty people were selected for travel grants supported by the National Science Foundation based on criteria of (a) quality of research, (b) career benefit, (c) need for support, and (d) representation of diverse individuals and institutions\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel E Giammar"
