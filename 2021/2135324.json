 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve private genetic testing and specialized bacterial and viral screenings.  The demand for genetic testing has increased over the past decade, however existing genetics companies often rely on selling clients' genetic information in order to remain profitable. While this platform will originally be used for human genomes, it can be modified in order to sequence bacteria and viruses. This could have applications for reaching remote populations and enabling diagnostics for infection and illnesses, as well as offering the possibility of at-home viral and bacterial testing. With COVID-19 highlighting the importance of early detection and quarantine for infected populations, this technology could be adapted to test for the yearly influenza or other contagious diseases, and to more generally streamline screening and diagnostics.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project develops a genetic sequencer using a graphene nanoribbon with nanopores suspended in ionic fluid to detect voltage changes as DNA translocates through it. Nucleotide base pairs are distinguished based on their unique electronic signature, which are analyzed to determine the genetic code of the gene and detect crucial mutations in the gene of interest.  A recent discovery has found that fortifying the graphene with an alloy allows the DNA to pass through in a controlled manner.  While it was previously only able to sequence a few nucleotides, the improvements made on the model have allowed for full gene sequencing.  The platform has the potential to enable more accurate, rapid, and cost-effective sequencing compared to other protein membrane systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
