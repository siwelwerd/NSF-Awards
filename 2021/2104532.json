 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasing adoption of blockchain technology in a variety of sectors, including cryptocurrency and healthcare systems, is resulting in a global shortage of skilled professionals knowledgeable in blockchain security. To address this urgent need to grow the workforce, the project team will develop and evaluate instructional laboratory modules centered on the topic of blockchain security applications.  The project's outcome will be nine reusable lab modules and teaching components that can readily be integrated into a  range of cybersecurity courses. The modules will also be packaged to allow for easy and broad dissemination. The project team will provide tutorials for college and university educators and engage in outreach at local museums, Hackathon events, and professional organizations to reach K-12, IT professional, and public audiences. In an effort to improve the representation of individuals that are members of underrepresented groups in the next-generation blockchain security workforce, the project team will organize an education workshop at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, a Historically Black College and University (HBCU). \r\n\r\nThe project will develop hands-on labs at the intersection of blockchains and cybersecurity. Specific topics that will be addressed include: blockchain and information security protocols; blockchain and financial technologies security; blockchain application programming interface (API) security; and blockchain and network security. The associated educational research intends to address the extent to which two essential learning objectives are facilitated by the labs: 1) students' ability to create domain applications secured by the blockchains (blockchain for security); and 2) students' ability to analyze and understand the security of blockchain systems (blockchain by security). To address the first objective, Tasks 1 and 2 plan to develop lab modules on blockchain applications in securing information security infrastructures and financial technologies. To address the second objective, Tasks 3 and 4 intend to develop labs for blockchain security at the levels of API and underlying networks. In each lab, the project team will  conduct instructional design, development, and education evaluation activities.  \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
