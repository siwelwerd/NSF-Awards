 "awd_abstract_narration": "On November 30, 2018 a magnitude 7 earthquake struck just north of Anchorage, Alaska and caused over $75 million in damage to private and public facilities.  The earthquake took place in the upper part of a subducting slab where the slab may be bending downwards, and early indications suggest that the event was related to stresses caused by plate bending.  In the weeks and months following a large earthquake, slip and deformation can continue to take place along a tectonic plate boundary.  To better understand that nature of this deformation, this study would place five continuous GPS (global positioning system) stations near the earthquake epicenter, as well as record campaign GPS measurements at other local benchmark locations.  Data from this study could be used to better understand the behavior along the Denali fault and improve constraints on local seismic hazards.  \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on constraining postseismic deformation due to the magnitude 7 Anchorage earthquake, a normal faulting event within the Yakutat flat slab, including how coseismic and postseismic deformation may trigger changes in slip along the subduction interface. To achieve this, five new continuous GPS sites will be installed in the near-field of the earthquake and repeat campaign surveys will be conducted at benchmarks throughout the region. These measurements will provide a dataset that will be able to more completely characterize postseismic deformation, variations in locking and creeping behavior on the subduction interface, and potential triggered slow slip events.  The effect of intraslab normal-faulting earthquakes on upper plate deformation, coupling along the subduction interface, and transient events on the interface is not well understood.   Coseismic displacements recorded at continuous GPS sites show a complex deformation pattern and the location of the event make it likely that viscoelastic relaxation in the asthenosphere will occur.  Aftershocks recorded in the first weeks after the earthquake roughly delineate a horizontal surface, suggesting that the events may be occurring at or near the plate interface. The main shock occurred within a region that has experienced multi-year slow slip events in the past and studies in other subduction zones suggest that such regions are more prone to triggered slow-slip events after an earthquake. Along the eastern limit of the Yakutat flat slab, a postseismic study of the 2002 Denali earthquake suggested that that event may have caused long-term changes of the coupling along that section of the subduction interface. The sparseness of GPS sites within the aftershock zone makes it likely that transient changes on the underlying interface may go undetected and that postseismic deformation and changes in the coupling along the interface may not be able to be fully characterized. Data collected from the proposed new network of continuous GPS added to the data from existing continuous GPS and repeat surveys at campaign benchmarks will allow an evaluation of these signals at a more temporally and spatially dense scale than is currently possible.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLarge earthquakes provide a wealth of opportunities to study how the solid Earth works.  The earthquake itself allows investigation of how and why faults suddenly slip, but the adjustment of the Earth after a large earthquake also provides valuable scientific information.  A large earthquake reduces stress along the part of the fault that moved but increases stress in the surrounding parts of the Earth?s crust and mantle.  The Earth can respond to this increased stress in several ways.  Aftershocks are smaller earthquakes that occur for days or months after the main, larger earthquake.  Postseismic deformation, including afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation, can occur days to years after an earthquake.  Afterslip is slip that usually takes place on the fault surface in the areas surrounding the part that slipped abruptly during a large earthquake.  Viscoelastic relaxation is related to flow in the mantle as that part of the Earth adjusts to the stresses imposed by the earthquake.  Understanding how, where, and for how long postseismic deformation occurs provides information about properties of the fault, the crust and the mantle which can help us better evaluate how and where large earthquakes happen and what effects the earthquakes might cause. \n\n \n\nPostseismic deformation can be observed with GPS/GNSS data.  As postseismic deformation begins immediately after the earthquake and can last for months or years, it is important to begin observations as soon as possible after an earthquake occurs and continue measurements for some time.  The goal of this RAPID grant was to make GPS measurements after the M7.1 2018 Anchorage earthquake so that the data would be available for future research.  Repeated surveys of sites in the area surrounding the earthquake?s epicenter were done through collaborations with colleagues at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the US Geological Survey.  At several sites, we established temporary continuous sites that would collect temporally dense data to determine how motion changed right after the earthquake.  Five new continuous GPS sites were installed after snow melted and when ground conditions allowed and these sites collected daily data for several years.  We have analyzed all the data collected and made preliminary interpretations.  Postseismic deformation was observed in the data and appears to be limited to several months after the earthquake.  All data has been archived and is freely available for use.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/11/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Julie Elliott"
