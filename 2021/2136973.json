 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to make a practice-changing impact in tissue biopsy procedures by moving from manual straight (rigid) needle insertions to robotic and steerable needle insertions. With this technology, physicians can take biopsy samples from hard-to-reach or impossible-to-reach lesions using an active steerable core biopsy needle. For many types of cancer, biopsy is the definitive test for diagnosis. The long-term beneficial consequences of the project will include: (i) increased accuracy of biopsy extraction, (ii) reduced damage to surrounding tissue and sensitive organ(s), (iii) reduced risk of bleeding and infection, and (iv) reduced necessity and frequency of repeat biopsies. The active steering of the needle proposed in this work is applicable to a number of cancer interventions including both diagnosis and therapy, such as in-vivo analysis using Raman spectroscopy as well as brachytherapy, photodynamic therapy, radio frequency-based thermal ablation, and viral/gene therapy.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project develops tissue biopsy procedures by offering a new steerable core biopsy needle that can actively bend inside tissue using smart shape memory alloy actuators. The movement of the steerable core biopsy needle is controlled inside the body by a novel control algorithm that relies on the shape-sensing capabilities of the smart actuators to provide needle tip position as a feedback. The technical hurdles include complexity in shape memory alloy hysteresis actuation and shape sensing control inside tissue. The control system receives commands from the operator and provides appropriate signals to the actuators to realize desired bending on the biopsy needle. The biocompatibility and stiffness of the active needle results in robotic manipulation, online shape sensing, and enhanced control inside the tissue to reach the target areas with more precision.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
