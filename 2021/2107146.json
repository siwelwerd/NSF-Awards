 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Texas Southern University seeks to strengthen the university's ability to recruit, retain, and graduate underrepresented students in STEM by adding an Environmental Science (ES) minor to the existing degree programs. \r\n\r\nThe primary goal of the project is to create a new Environmental Science (ES) minor program for STEM undergraduate students to gain an overview and applied knowledge of environmental issues. Following the completion of 21 semester credit hours (5 core courses and 2 elective courses), students will be eligible to earn a minor in ES. With interdisciplinary collaboration of multiple STEM departments (biology, chemistry, and civil engineering), the new ES minor program has the potential to improve the readiness of African American STEM undergraduate students in securing professional employment and/or pursuing graduate degrees in ES and related fields. Effects of the ES Minor Program on improvement of self-confidence in career readiness and self-efficacy in career decision-making will be assessed using surveys and focus group discussion. Knowledge, results, and outcomes of this project will be disseminated through a variety of venues, such as conferences, workshops, Internet, newsletters, handbooks, and journal publications to share the findings across various stakeholder groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
