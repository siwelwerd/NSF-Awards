 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Blue Economy, as defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, contributed nearly $373 billion to the United States economy in 2018 and grew faster than the nation\u2019s economy overall. Additionally, the sector of the Blue Economy related to tourism and recreation represents the largest contributor overall, nearly $143 billion. While the value of such ocean resources and sectors is immense, the benefits of these resources and commitment to their use and conservation are not shared equally by all people. This project addresses the following objectives 1) identification of appropriate data sources that are relevant for connecting underserved groups to the Blue Economy 2) analysis and packaging of data sources into applicable products that are useful for Blue Economy networks to reach appropriate users, and 3) provision of products/training/education to groups that help establish connections via jobs, awareness, and commitments within the Blue Economy for underserved groups. A key outcome of the project will be to increase awareness, engagement, and connection to the Blue Economy for traditionally underserved populations in the United States. Traditionally underserved groups may have previously established cultural connections to ocean resources that are not captured in current assessment and quantification of the Blue Economy. The Blue Economy should be accessible by all U.S. citizens, regardless of their connection to ocean resources. Participation in Blue Economy related activities can only be expanded for underserved populations when they are fully aware of the activities and opportunities present within Blue Economy sectors. In the medium term, awareness of Blue Economy activities and opportunities translates to action for responsible use, marketing, and business promotion for underserved populations. Following increases in awareness, increases in access are the goal outcomes in the medium-term time period. This will broaden participation in the Blue Economy for underserved populations by inspiring confidence in ocean resources as sources of economic benefit. In the long term, awareness and access build into attachment to ocean resources and the Blue Economy. Finally, the project will build a foundation that supports expansion of underserved population use and valuation of ocean resources. Through short and medium-term expansion of awareness and access for opportunities in the Blue Economy, societal benefits will emerge as long-term attachment to those resources and connections.\r\n\r\nThis research addresses the following objectives 1) identification of appropriate data sources that are relevant for connecting underserved groups to the Blue Economy 2) analysis and packaging of data sources into applicable products that are useful for Blue Economy networks to reach appropriate users, and 3) provision of products/training/education to groups that help establish connections via jobs, awareness, and commitments within the Blue Economy for underserved groups. This project will make use of big data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to develop a platform that is accessible to the public. The platform will aggregate data and stratify outputs based upon social criteria such as desired activities, conditions, and connections to the Blue Economy. The platform will be functional for any person with internet access, but will be coupled with educational tools, workshops, and partnerships specifically designed to connect underserved communities to the Blue Economy. Partners in this convergent research effort (e.g. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Integrated Information Services) will provide indirect communication to the program through their research and data provisioning efforts. Educational tools, workshops, and partnerships will be tailored to the specific audience of a particular community, knowing that cultural connections and commitments to ocean resources differ across diverse groups. Proposed outcomes include creation of opportunities, awareness, and historical/contemporary context within the Blue Economy for underserved populations in the short term. In the medium/long term, expected outcomes include increased use, engagement, and business/job opportunities centered on stronger attachment to the Blue Economy for underserved communities and populations. The proposed activities address contemporary analytical challenges that cut across multiple disciplines and require advanced analyses. Existing data streams and models that utilize environmental and economic data to provide information to coastal communities about weather events, transportation routing, and impacts of hazards will be leveraged to help incorporate additional social endpoints. By integrating human use and cultural information to such conceptual and statistical models, description of linkages that may be influenced by oceanic and atmospheric phenomena can be included in platforms that that benefit society. The analysis and understanding of ocean conditions using biological and ecological sciences is a vital component of this proposed project. Using social and biological data to converge upon improved understanding of latent variables that strengthen awareness, access, and attachment to ocean resources is beneficial to society on its own. However, when considering the true impact of awareness, access, and attachment to such resources, the dependency and connections with economic endpoints such as employment and incomes are critical and must be measured and justified. Additionally, a more detailed understanding of the goods and services provided by ocean resources beyond traditional market valuation (e.g. shipping, fisheries harvest, etc.) offers insight into opportunities for human engagement with the ocean and valuation of non-market goods and services provided by coastal resources. This more complete assessment and understanding of the Blue Economy may then offer underserved populations additional pathways into such networks, to expand upon historical connections and create contemporary opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

As the project team grew, learned, and evolved during the Convergence Accelerator innovation curriculum, a shortened moniker for the team was created. The project became commonly known as &ldquo;iCOAST&rdquo;, standing for <em>inclusion through convergence of ocean and social technology</em> and sought to create knowledge and products to improve inclusion and access to coastal and ocean resource knowledge and settings. Within the project framework, the team created a conceptual platform known as SEA (storytelling, education, and access) which would have components to identify and address the societal deficit of inclusion in these settings.&nbsp; Within the context of the SEA platform, there were four major outcomes/findings:</p>\n<p>First, development of the platform itself as a way of more logically identifying pain points for underserved populations with respect to access in ocean and coastal areas. This development and outcome also helped identify equitable opportunities in appropriate locations, and facilitated communication between scientists, businesses, resource managers, and the public.</p>\n<p>Second, the development of an augmented reality gaming platform with content specifically designed to relate to ocean and coastal areas and underserved communities was developed as a project outcome. This customized content was delivered to National Marine Sanctuary sites as a way to pilot their use for engagement with youth and adults for education and fun in these ocean and coastal areas.</p>\n<p>Third, the development and implementation of experiential STEM educational camps for youth associated with ocean and coastal sites was a project outcome that was achieved during summer 2023. A camp was held for youth at Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary in Michigan and included hand-on experiential learning activities associated with coastal resources such as underwater ROV building, glass bottom boat tours, and other scientific and recreational activities.</p>\n<p>Fourth, the outcome associated with dissemination of project development and output through phase one included publications, presentations, videos, webinars, and audio recordings associated with highlighting experiences and stories relating to ocean and coastal resources.</p>\n<p>These project outcomes highlight the process of knowledge development across different fields associated with environmental, social, economic, and cultural understanding.&nbsp; Outcomes included detailed analyses of ocean and coastal resource value with production of economic contribution to local and regional job creation and educational communications with both youth and adult audiences across media types.&nbsp; Project outcomes also benefitted societal outcomes of providing more knowledge sources to underserved populations through creation of experiential camps and augmented reality games and content.&nbsp; Creating relevancy for all parts of society to learn and engage with ocean and coastal resources was a key outcome of this project across phase one to provide far reaching impacts via products and tools.</p>\n<p>Our research was able to involve people from underserved communities in a positivistic and successful community education outreach effort. We facilitated four STEM camps at the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary, educating nearly 100 students ranging from ages 5-18. Our work included an effort to understand the constraints that adults from underserved communities (Homestead and Florida City, Florida) were burdened with, and also the strategies visitors employed to participate in healthy outdoor recreation activities in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.&nbsp; Overall, our objectives were met, and we feel very gratified to have contributed to the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s efforts to focus on diversity and inclusion in federal land and water-based settings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/26/2024<br>\nModified by: Ross&nbsp;G&nbsp;Andrew</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137826/2137826_10772364_1706307963402_TBNMS_camp_summer_2023_ROV_activity_1_face_removed--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137826/2137826_10772364_1706307963402_TBNMS_camp_summer_2023_ROV_activity_1_face_removed--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Thunder Bay STEM camp ROV building summer 2023\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137826/2137826_10772364_1706307963402_TBNMS_camp_summer_2023_ROV_activity_1_face_removed--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Thunder Bay STEM camp ROV building summer 2023\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Youth participants in experiential STEM camps are shown working to learn about and construct small remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to explore portions of Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Robert Burns</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ross&nbsp;G&nbsp;Andrew\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Thunder Bay STEM camp ROV building summer 2023</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137826/2137826_10772364_1706308704123_agents_demo_icoast--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137826/2137826_10772364_1706308704123_agents_demo_icoast--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"AR gaming prototype example for underserved populations in Great Lakes blue economy areas\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137826/2137826_10772364_1706308704123_agents_demo_icoast--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"AR gaming prototype example for underserved populations in Great Lakes blue economy areas\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screenshots of low-fidelity prototype content in Agents of Discovery smartphone gaming app related to Blue Economy history and Tuskegee airmen (left) and underwater exploration in the Great Lakes (right).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ross Andrew</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ross&nbsp;G&nbsp;Andrew\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">AR gaming prototype example for underserved populations in Great Lakes blue economy areas</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137826/2137826_10772364_1706308874627_larissa_interview_fknms_1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137826/2137826_10772364_1706308874627_larissa_interview_fknms_1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"iCOAST recreational constraints surveys\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137826/2137826_10772364_1706308874627_larissa_interview_fknms_1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"iCOAST recreational constraints surveys\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student researcher conducting survey for blue economy recreational constraints with public in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary in spring 2023.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Larissa Martins</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ross&nbsp;G&nbsp;Andrew\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">iCOAST recreational constraints surveys</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137826/2137826_10772364_1706308763261_model_output_example_icoast--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137826/2137826_10772364_1706308763261_model_output_example_icoast--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"iCOAST model output for social and recreational prioritization\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137826/2137826_10772364_1706308763261_model_output_example_icoast--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"iCOAST model output for social and recreational prioritization\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example of spatial modeling showing counties of Michigan, USA with modeled output of marine recreation suitability and social vulnerability.
