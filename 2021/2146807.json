Many scientists and programs are struggling with how to do this, including with building the right networks and partnerships. With this funding, the Consortium for Ocean Leadership would organize and support a workshop to bring together the U.S. leads of some of the observing programs recently endorsed by the UN Ocean Decade. The focus will be on biological observing programs (and components of programs) as a critical discipline that is currently underrepresented in global ocean observing systems. The workshop will support these programs in planning for how they will collaborate at a national level on stakeholder engagement and co-design; data standards and access; technology development and advancement; and outreach and communications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
