 "awd_abstract_narration": "The team will use the MAROON-X spectrograph on the Gemini North observatory to conduct follow-up spectroscopic observations of all TESS candidate planets around M-dwarf stars. They will find orbits for these planets, as well as masses and densities to high precision. The team will also attempt to determine the mass fraction for M-dwarf planets in the Earth \u2013 Super-Earth regime (1 \u2013 10 Earth masses). One of the objectives of the work is to identify interesting targets for follow-up by future large ground-based and space-based telescopes. At the conclusion of the work, the MAROON-X instrument will transition from being a guest instrument on Gemini North to being a facility instrument. The team will train a post-doc, and provide research opportunities to undergraduates from under-represented groups.\r\n\r\nThe team will use the MAROON-X instrument to make radial velocity observations of TESS-observed M dwarf stars at V-band magnitudes of at 16 where planetary transits are recorded. The combination of the radial velocity data, at a precision of 30 cm/sec, with the transit information will allow inference of the planet\u2019s mass to within 10%, allowing for inference of the planet\u2019s bulk composition. The team will observe 38 planets, of which 20 are potentially rocky. These measurements should allow for the first statistical analysis of planets in the 1-10 Earth mass range around M dwarf stars, which make up 75% of the stars in our galaxy. MAROON-X has been commissioned, and is currently operating as a guest instrument at Gemini North.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
