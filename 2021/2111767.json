 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address challenges of animal farming through cell-based meat production. Approximately 30% of the Earth\u2019s surface, 70% of all arable land, and 29% of the global freshwater supply is dedicated to animal farming. Livestock is responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major threat to biodiversity. 70% of all antibiotics used in the United States are used on farm animals and contributes to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Cell-based meat development is estimated to generate significant reductions in greenhouse gases and use of land, water, and energy, as well as antibiotics in meat production. The proposed project aims to develop novel technologies that will accelerate cell-based meat development.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project develops a novel scaffolding material for the generation of animal tissue, specifically skeletal muscle. The proposed project will ultimately advance current scientific knowledge on the mechanisms underlying tissue generation and elucidate the molecular principles governing cell adhesion, differentiation, and growth of animal cells during tissue development. Key technical objectives include demonstrating that the proposed scaffold can be successfully customized to harbor any cell adhesion molecule of interest, and proving that a novel biomaterial can be adapted as a tissue-culture-grade reagent. Fluorescence microscopy will be used to ascertain the extent of animal cell adhesion and growth on the proposed scaffold. These studies will advance understanding of animal cell interactions with their extracellular milieu, and how environmental molecular properties and cues are tuned to influence de novo tissue development in vitro.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While promising, several hurdles remain in the way of making cultivated meat a reality including consumer appeal, technological feasibility, and economic viability. A major drawback plaguing cell-based and plant-based meat alternatives, and thus limiting their appeal to a broader consumer base, is their lack of structure and texture that mimics natural animal tissue. Current cultivated meat products are devoid of the shape and texture of natural animal tissues because they are essentially single-cell aggregate, mincemeat-type products. Many scaffolding technologies exist for the generation of structured tissues, but almost all have been generated for therapeutic applications, and thus not developed with manufacturing cost constraints in mind. A costly step in manufacturing scaffolds is the functionalization of the scaffolding material with mammalian extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which requires protein purification followed by conjugation chemistry or a physical immobilization method. Because meat is a commodity product, high manufacturing costs cannot be tolerated so there is an urgent need for scaffold innovations that can circumvent such costly steps.

Our disruptive technology challenges the idea that microbes cannot be used as a tissue culture reagent, and instead exploits the rapid growth properties and the tractability of a variety of microbial species to generate a scalable solution for the production of customizable scaffolds. For our Phase I efforts, we proposed to adapt GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) microbes to provide two critical aspects of a successful tissue scaffold: functionalization and structure.

We developed a variety of structured cultivated meat prototypes including quail, chicken, and pork. Our prototypes had cell densities that reached over 60% of the total mass, approaching cell densities of natural muscle. We conclude from our Phase I efforts that our scaffolds function well for the generation of cultivated meat products.
