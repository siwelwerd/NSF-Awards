 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to support individuals with sleep disorders.  Sleep and circadian rhythms influence human performance, mood, decision-making, learning, memory, alertness, and overall physical and mental health. The demand for humans to perform critical work at adverse circadian phases while lacking adequate sleep has played a role in some of the world\u2019s most devastating industrial and engineering disasters, as well as \u201ceveryday\u201d incidents in the workplace and on the roadways. The economic burden of sleep loss is estimated at $411 billion/year in the US. Providing light appropriately can help address these potentially dangerous situations. The proposed project combines hardware design (fixed and wearable sensors), systems engineering and circadian rhythm biology to provide individuals in shared spaces with targeted (primarily light-based) interventions to improve their circadian rhythmicity, sleep and general wellness. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project integrates wearable and stationary biometric circadian sensors for measuring the circadian state of each individual; indoor positioning sensors for tracking ambient occupation patterns; controllers for delivering light and other interventions; and algorithms for effectively managing conflicting and competing schedules. Shared spaces offer several unique and highly individualized challenges in terms of ensuring that the stimulus for one individual does not interfere with another person.  The studies will validate the technology and provide data to train the algorithms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
