 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent technological breakthroughs afford unprecedented new opportunities for high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) visualization and mapping of Earth\u2019s surface.  This project is aimed at exploiting this technology to develop new field techniques for 3D geologic mapping.   Developing these techniques is potentially transformative because conventional techniques based on fixed-scale paper maps were severely handicapped by low resolution issues that are resolved with modern technology.  As these techniques develop, geosciences will have unprecedented abilities to resolve 3D geometry of rock bodies and this new ability will open new avenues of research across a spectrum of the geosciences.  Basic science applications will ultimately improve understanding of subsurface geologic bodies and this enhanced understanding will have economic impacts in extractive industries (mining and petroleum industries) as well as environmental applications (groundwater modeling, hazards, and shallow subsurface modeling).  Finally, 3D visualizations of geologic structures developed in the study will be important new educational resources for the broader geoscience community including the University of Texas El Paso, a tier 1 Hispanic Serving Institution, and will provide cutting edge technology access to those Hispanic students.\r\n\r\nGeosciences are in the midst of a revolution brought on by 3D visualization.  The development of Structure-from-Motion/Multiview Stereo (SM) models provide unprecedented new opportunities for 3D visualization of Earth\u2019s surface.  In particular, there are new opportunities to understand the geometry of geologic bodies by 3D mapping at accuracies unattainable a few years ago. Bedrock geologic mapping has yet to make extensive use of this new technology.  This project is an attempt to facilitate the transformation of traditional field-based, map-scale studies to fully 3D mapping methods. High-precision 3D geologic models and their ultimate derivative product - a fully 4D analysis \u2013 is only possible when we can routinely produce high resolution 3D maps.  This project aims to contribute to this goal by:  1) Developing SM model construction at map scale using a manned aircraft in two settings (desert, arctic) where this technology should be transformative;  2) Conducting live 3D mapping experiments with different software packages, based on regional and local SM models acquired in the desert setting as well as experiment with using unmanned aerials systems (aka drones) as a field tool during 3D field mapping; and 3) Developing a bridge from GIS to the Strabospot database, utilizing our expertise in the open source program QGIS with an objective of providing a streamlined application for incorporation of legacy paper map data into Strabospot aimed at senior researchers who hold most of this archive.  These tools will enhance the work of field researchers across the geosciences, and prevent loss of legacy data as researchers retire.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project had a primary objective of developing techniques for 3D geologic mapping using high-resolution terrain models developed from Structure-from-Motion/Multiview Stereo (SM) photogrammetry methods. SM exploits modern computational power and digital photography to produce high resolution models of earths surface using large numbers of images from arbitrary look directions. In this project we experimented with data acquisition from both unmanned aircraft (aka drones) and manned aircraft with imagery acquired out the windows of the aircraft as well as with vertical incidence imagery similar to conventional aerial photography. Focus sites emphasized areas with nearly 100% rock exposure in steep terrain because vertical cliffs are essentially invisible on conventional geologic maps yet contain the best, albeit often inaccessible, rock exposures for geologic analysis. We looked at two sites that afforded very different challenges in imaging: 1) canyon walls in a hyper-arid site in the Death Valley region where one canyon wall was well illuminated but the other in shadow during most of the day; and 2) a high-latitude, glaciated site in Alaska with lighting conditions ranging from directly illuminated by the sun to sites in deep shadow with extreme contrasts between rock exposure and white glacial ice and snow. In the Death Valley site earlier NSF funding provided a LiDAR data set for comparison to the SM data.\n\n\nThe Death Valley LiDAR data set allowed us to assess the accuracy of SM data relative to LiDAR data set known to be accurate to the centimeter level. In Pavlis and Serpa (2023) we showed that both our drone based models and manned aircraft based models had resolutions at centimeter to decimeter level and were accurately scaled relative to the LiDAR reference. We also evaluated the accuracy of model georeferencing using camera positions referenced with onboard GPS as well as a Google Earth method using natural objects visible on multiple images. We found that both methods produced models subject to rigid body shifts from the LiDAR reference comparable to the precision of the reference method; i.e. standard error in differential GPS, size of objects used for reference, or both. The Death Valley data were also used for the bulk of our experimentation on best practices for using the models as a base for 3D geologic mapping. The first result of that work is reported in Pavlis and Serpa (2024) with additional publications on the results in manuscripts still under preparation. The results in Pavlis and Serpa (2024) demonstrate the power of the method by revealing geologic structures that were far more complex than recognized in geologic mapping efforts by three earlier researchers working in the area; a result we ascribed to a combination of the ability to visualize the structures from any arbitrary angle, the ability to map features accurate to decimeter resolutions in three dimensions, and a local detail that the size of the geologic structures recognized were larger than features easily seen in an individual outcrop but smaller than structures easily shown at conventional map scales like topographic maps. Another manuscript for publication is in preparation reporting on a more regional analysis of the geologic structure.\n\n\nNot yet published are results from our Alaskan imaging experiments where the problem of extreme contrast between dark rocks and white snow in deep shadow was a challenge for model development. Processing in these types of images is a well-known problem, but the challenge here was developing a processing scheme to efficiently process the thousands of images used in the models within a reasonable time frame. We ultimately found a scheme that combined automated processing systems for large blocks of data followed by focused processing of smaller blocks with comparable lighting. These results along with our geologic analysis of the focus site will appear in a future publication.\n\n\nFinally, as a broader impact to the study we devoted significant effort in acquiring drone based SM data over sites with significant potential for use in geoscience education. Virtual outcrops like those we modeled have been used more and more in geoscience education, particularly since the covid pandemic with whole volumes devoted to the topic. Our data have been uploaded to a public site v3geo with suggestions for their use in instruction. We have other data sets that we are using to develop lesson plans for future distribution or data sets to be used for instruction at the University of Texas El Paso.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/26/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: TerryLPavlis\n"
