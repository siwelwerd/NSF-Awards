 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Melanoplinae make up the most diverse group of grasshoppers on the North American. In this subfamily, there are 606 species in 43 genera, including the very diverse genus Melanoplus, with 273 species placed in 31 species groups and an additional 83 species not currently placed in any group. The goal of this project is to produce a comprehensive and dynamic taxonomic treatise of the Melanoplinae of North America and Mexico. This synthetic work will complement previous treatises on the grasshoppers of North America (The Grasshoppers of North America series Vol I and II; Otte 1981 and 1984) and will provide a foundation for future genetic and phylogenetic studies that will inevitably increase our understanding of the relationships among this diverse group. In turn, this resource will encourage and promote scientific studies that use grasshoppers to understand evolutionary, ecological and environmental processes. Broder Impact of this project include outreach to the public and K-12 students, as well as museum exhibits. \r\n\r\nThe Grasshoppers of North America Vol. III. Melanoplinae will 1) provide a thorough and updated taxonomic treatment of known species and species groups, summarize information on their ecologies, and update maps of their geographical distributions, 2) provide illustrations of diagnostic characteristics and produce identification keys to the major species groups, and 3) produce a dynamic on-line resource on Orthoptera Species File that will be updated and responsive to future taxonomic discoveries, revisions, and systematic works.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
