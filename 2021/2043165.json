 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the development of improved methods for measuring reactive mercury in the atmosphere.  Controlled laboratory experiments will be conducted to test and develop new and better materials for detecting oxidized mercury.  The project includes measurements of reactive mercury in the ambient atmosphere at a diverse group of sites with different atmospheric chemistry. Improving the ability to quantify the concentrations and chemistry of reactive mercury compounds is critical to developing strategies for mitigating their damaging impacts.\r\n\r\nThis effort has three main objectives. These are to: (1) Develop a better understanding of the chemical reactions responsible for forming and transforming reactive mercury (RM) through laboratory experiments and field campaigns; (2) Test and develop new and better materials for oxidized mercury (Hg) detection, including the identification of desorbable, long-term collection, and short-term collection surfaces for better resolved measurements; and (3) Develop and test a method to estimate RM concentrations measured over the past 20 years using archived data. The work is critical for understanding the Hg biogeochemical cycle and modeling atmospheric Hg processes and deposition, the two priority focus areas recently identified by the NADP\u2019s Mercury in the Environment and Links to Deposition Science (MELD) Committee.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
