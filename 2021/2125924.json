 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum sciences and technologies have progressed remarkably in recent years. This progress includes, for example, new quantum processors with unique computational capabilities, secure channels over metropolitan distances, and unprecedented resolution in fields and force sensing. Continued progress requires the training of a new generation of scientists and engineers to develop these technologies. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of California Los Angeles will accelerate these computation, communication, and sensing milestones and their interdisciplinary interfaces by training doctoral students in this nascent field of quantum science and technologies. The program will train 134 doctoral students, including 67 funded trainees, bridging relevant concepts from engineering, physics, materials, chemistry, and mathematics. The traineeship has a particularly strong emphasis on increasing the representation of women and minority students in quantum sciences and technologies through broad yet specific outreach recruitment, mentoring, and retention programs.\r\n\r\nThe Accelerating Interdisciplinary Frontiers in Quantum Sciences and Technologies (AIF-Q) program consists of four thrusts. These include: (1) atomic qubits and novel chemistry; (2) materials and algorithms towards new forms of computation; (3) optical qubits for quantum simulations; and (4) trapped ions for many-body physics. Spanning these interdisciplinary layers, the traineeship ties together core pillars of heterogeneous materials, microwave spectroscopy, and quantum algorithms. Central to the thrusts and core pillars is interdisciplinary graduate education and research training, guided by the faculty and industry-national laboratory interactions. The integrated training program consists of interdisciplinary three-faculty advising and mentoring through laboratory rotations, new course offerings in interdisciplinary quantum sciences and technologies, distinguished external advisory and internal steering councils, and formative-summative assessments. The program team will pursue seed and joint interactions together with industry and national laboratory partners. A long-term institutional commitment will be embodied in the proposed formation of a University of California Inter-Departmental Degree Program in Quantum Sciences and Technologies.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative, and scalable models for STEM graduate education training.  The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through the comprehensive traineeship model that is innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
