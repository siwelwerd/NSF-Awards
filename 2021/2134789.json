 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support for the 2022 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Colloidal, Macromolecular, and Polyelectrolyte Solutions: Connecting Theory and Simulations to Experiments and Applications, which will be held February 6-11, 2022 in Ventura, CA.  The conference will be preceded by a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for graduate students.  Together, the two events will provide opportunities for researchers, especially young investigators and students, to present results of their research, meet senior experts in the field, and discuss emerging research trends in colloidal and polymeric solutions.  These materials are important in a variety of technology areas including coatings, paints, personal-care products and cosmetics, and food processing.  The goal of the GRC and GRS is to bring promote discussions that will enable comparisons between experiments, numerical simulations, and theory for these important materials.\r\n\r\nColloidal and polymer science, including polyelectrolytes, is growing in importance in a wide range of applications, especially those involving biotechnology.  The development of RNA vaccines was enabled in part by creating nanoparticle complexes of DNA, a polyelectrolyte, with oppositely charged surfactants.  Synthetic structures that mimic cells, such as membraneless organelles, are formed by segregating charged proteins that exhibit polyelectrolyte phase behavior.  Increasing computing power, new computational methods, and high resolution experiments now allow comparisons between experiment and simulation at length and time scales that are accessible to both.  This is the theme of the GRC/GRS.  Session topics will include polyelectrolytes and ionic liquids, confined colloids, directed assembly, propelled colloids, interfacial systems, polymers and biology, polymer glasses, and driven elastomers.  The GRS for graduate students will include technical sessions as well as career development sessions for students and young investigators.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
