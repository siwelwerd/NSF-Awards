 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy relies on detecting light from faint and distant objects in the Universe.  To do this all light gathered by a telescope needs to be measured with highly efficient instruments that minimize losses of the light collected by the primary mirror. The investigators will build a new kind of diffraction grating and reflection-suppressing (anti-glare) optical lenses. The team will etch nanometer-scale structures by bombarding the glass surfaces with charged ions in a controlled way. This method has been shown to greatly improve the light-transmission efficiency of these optical devices. In combination, gratings and anti-glare lenses will increase the efficiency of current and future observing instruments. This program integrates and provides training opportunities for students in astronomy, instrument science, optical physics, and material engineering topics.  There are potential applications of such devices in a broad range of electro-optical components and systems in other disciplines. \r\n\r\nThis research project aims to advance a range of photonic and instrumentation tools that are crucial for astronomical spectroscopic research. This includes the introduction of highly deterministic reactive ion etching fabrication technologies for high aspect ratio, compact line-density, high-dispersion astronomical surface relief gratings, as well as, randomly textured nanoscale anti-reflective surface structures, and their combined use to push diffraction and transmission efficiency to theoretical limits. These gains will not only significantly enhance the capabilities of existing telescope and facilities, but also demonstrate the fabrication technology for diffraction gratings and transmissive optical elements needed in the next generation of astronomical instruments. When combined with Extremely Large Telescopes and their Adaptive Optics systems, these advances will make a significant improvement in total delivered throughput for a broad range of astronomical low/medium/high resolution spectroscopic instruments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Yet the vastness of the Universe still leaves myriad planets, stars, and galaxies in its uncharted corners near and far. The intensity variations of colors of the light (spectra) from these objects exhibit features that very well reflect the objects&rsquo; physical properties. Hence, robust detection of the spectra from these objects plays a critical role in understanding the physical properties / formations / evolutions of not only these objects, but also the entire Universe. The need for efficient tools arises because these objects emit very faint light, making it hard to detect their spectra. To meet this challenge, the investigator embarked on developing a new kind of highly efficient diffraction gratings and reflection-suppressing (anti-glare) optical lenses using the fabrication method called reactive ion plasma etching (RIPLE). Diffraction gratings can be made by etching precise straight-line ridges in optical glass through the RIPLE process. When passing these lines, light is separated into different colors much like the rainbow after the rain. For that reason, astronomical spectroscopic instruments (or spectrographs) must have diffraction gratings. Meanwhile, optical lenses can be made highly anti-reflective by sculpting microscopic leaf-like structures on the lens surfaces, resembling grass fields on rolling hills. These structures prevent the loss of light by reflection, as it passes from air into lenses or vice versa. These randomly distributed nanometer-scale surface structures (called rARSS) are etched by bombarding the glass surfaces with charged ions in a controlled way. This method has been shown to greatly improve the light-transmission efficiency of optical devices.

The large-area aspect is emphasized because astronomical spectrographs on large telescopes require \"large\" diffraction gratings. Though 100x100 sq. mm is considered \"medium\", the team's success in scaling the RIPLE process to this level clearly demonstrated the feasibility of scaling to much larger areas. The RIPLE gratings also contain broadband rARSS to minimize reflection loss at the non-grating surface. The team also explored the applicability of rARSS to the i-line glass materials. These materials transmit light of 365nm wavelength (called the i-line) very efficiently and hence are heavily used in semiconductor industry, and more recently astronomical spectrographs. The team found some of these i-line materials favorably responding to the rARSS fabrication process and identified specific material characteristics responsible for such responsiveness. The outcomes of these developments have been used to build highly efficient RIPLE gratings for an actual astronomical spectrograph, called the VIRUS2 instrument. The team demonstrated an additional 50% to 100% improvement in transmission efficiency of the VIRUS2 RIPLE gratings relative to the standard volume phase holographic (VPH) gratings. This inter-disciplinary and collaborative research demonstrated the effectiveness of the RIPLE process for manufacturing highly efficient large gratings, as well as, randomly textured nanoscale anti-reflective surface structures, and their combined use to push transmission efficiency theoretical limits.
