 "awd_abstract_narration": "Warming air temperatures are thawing frozen ground (permafrost) in the Arctic at a rapid rate. As frozen ground thaws it undergoes temperature fluctuations above and below freezing, known as freeze-thaw cycles. Freeze-thaw can impact the availability of important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, the activity of microorganisms, soil moisture and associated changes in oxygenation, and the release of greenhouse gases from thawing ground. The implications of freeze-thaw in thawing permafrost are amplified in the Arctic, which stores just under half of all soil carbon across the globe. This research will determine how exposure of previously frozen ground to freeze-thaw alters soil function and nutrient availability. This project supports one postdoctoral scholar and will fund freeze-thaw research and the development of an educational R/RStudio module for an Arctic dataset.\r\n\r\nFreeze-thaw is a disruptive, temperature driven process with direct impacts to both abiotic and biotic soil properties and their coupled interactions. Rising air temperatures expose previously unavailable compounds to plant uptake, microbial activity, and mineral sorption and precipitation while also altering biogeochemical processes within thawed soil. Freeze-thaw has been recorded to influence the migration of soil solutes (such as P, N, and Fe) through cryosuction in non-permafrost soils. In permafrost-affected soils, freeze-thaw triggered solute migration may coincide with nutrient pulses to the soil environment following microbial cell lysis and death or soil aggregate instability and breakage. In alpine and grassland systems, cryosuction during freeze-thaw can increase anoxic soil conditions with varying levels of Fe reduction and result in subsequent impacts to soil aromatics and dissolved organic carbon concentrations. The number of freeze-thaw cycles, freezing rate, and spatial distribution of freeze-thaw may vary, altering the degree of transport during cryosuction as well as informing microbial adaptation and resiliency. The proposed work will combine field data with freeze-thaw experiments to investigate temporal and spatial variations in freeze-thaw and the direct impacts to critical processes of soil biogeochemistry across a hillslope gradient in Alaskan tundra permafrost at the Toolik Field Station. The investigator will test the hypothesis that permafrost soil chemistry will be altered during the first freeze-thaw cycle, resulting in continuous changes in redox and nutrient availability throughout subsequent freeze-thaw. The study aims to restructure our understanding of permafrost thaw to include responses of the soil nutrient regime, redox chemistry, and microbial communities to freezing rate, repeated freeze-thaw, and spatial variation of freeze-thaw cycling.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Thaw depth varies both seasonally and spatially across a moisture gradient of dry to wet sites with implications for redox conditions and the distribution of iron, carbon, and phosphorus (Rooney et al., <em>in review</em>, supported by NSF 2006194, Herndon). Warming air temperatures across the North Slope can extend seasonal thaw depth while changes in ground insulation (via vegetation cover, organic layer thickness, or snow cover) can interact with air temperatures to increase the frequency of freeze-thaw cycles (<em>Rooney and Possinger, in review</em>). Year-round temperature measurements (July 2022 to July 2023) recorded spatial and depth differences in freeze-thaw cycle frequency at the wet site, with one plot showing surface freeze-thaw frequencies down to 20 cm (Fig. 1).</p>\n<p>We wanted to know how repeated freezing and thawing may affect iron forms and carbon composition as well as their interaction in soils that had previously little to no freeze-thaw exposure. We characterized the geochemical composition of surface, subsurface (active layer), and permafrost soils along the acidic tundra hillslope and subjected soils from the wet site to 1, 2, 5, 12, and 20 freeze-thaw cycles during laboratory incubation. We conducted sequential iron fractionations to measure total Fe and total P within short range order Fe, organic-bound Fe, and exchangeable Fe pools. Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Mass Spectrometry was used to characterize carbon composition and oxidation state of dissolved organic carbon compounds (EMSL UP 60557, Rooney).</p>\n<p>Prior to freeze-thaw incubation, we found differences in carbon composition across slope positions, with soils from the dry site generally more aromatic carbon composition compared with more aliphatic and lignin-like carbon compounds in the wet site soils (Fig 2). The presence of both aliphatic and lignin-like carbon compounds is interesting as saturated soils can favor lignin-like compounds (due to the oxygen requirement in enzymes that breakdown lignin). However, surface soils in the wet sites were not saturated for the full thaw season, and even when saturation did occur, reducing conditions (&lt; 300 mV) didn&rsquo;t develop until ~ 20 cm below the soil surface, potentially explaining the persistence of aliphatic compounds in wet soils.</p>\n<p>Wet soils underwent the freeze-thaw incubation. Our findings showed variability in the concentration of iron fractions and the relative abundance and oxidation state of carbon compound classes across the twenty freeze-thaw cycles. We found that by the twentieth freeze-thaw cycle, there were decreases in aliphatic compounds, indicating that the aliphatic pool underwent decomposition faster than lignin-like and aromatic compounds (Fig 3-4). Similar decreases in organic-bound Fe may indicate decomposition of iron-binding aliphatic compounds. Lower oxygen availability and reducing conditions may have favored aliphatic use and lignin preservation. It is likely that reducing conditions developed in our freeze-thaw incubations of saturated soils, similar to conditions observed &gt;10-20 cm depth in the field (Rooney et al., <em>in review</em>, supported by NSF 2006194, Herndon).</p>\n<p>We also wanted to better understand how freeze-thaw cycles influenced physical soil properties which can modify soil function. Prior work had shown changes to pore connectivity and pore size distributions in Toolik permafrost soil aggregates from freeze-thaw cycles. Through collaborations with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory&rsquo;s Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, we developed an open-source method and software called &ldquo;Pore2Chip&rdquo; for representing changes in soil physical structure within experimental platforms (called terraforms) with the specific goal of study how freeze-thaw cycles influenced pore-scale flow, carbon transport, and iron-carbon interactions (EMSL UP 61069, Rooney). This method is currently publicly available, and the publication is in review (Truong et al., <em>in review</em>).&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/28/2024<br>\nModified by: Erin&nbsp;C&nbsp;Rooney</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2138937/2138937_10765284_1730137544692_dry_wet_pca--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2138937/2138937_10765284_1730137544692_dry_wet_pca--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2138937/2138937_10765284_1730137544692_dry_wet_pca--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Principal Component Analysis of the organic carbon composition in dry and wet time-zero soils.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rooney et al., in prep</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erin&nbsp;C&nbsp;Rooney\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2138937/2138937_10765284_1730137630160_relabund_figure_iron--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2138937/2138937_10765284_1730137630160_relabund_figure_iron--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2138937/2138937_10765284_1730137630160_relabund_figure_iron--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Iron fractionations of surface, subsurface active layer, and permafrost soils across the 20 freeze-thaw cycle incubation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rooney et al., in prep</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erin&nbsp;C&nbsp;Rooney\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2138937/2138937_10765284_1730137172965_pca_fig--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2138937/2138937_10765284_1730137172965_pca_fig--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2138937/2138937_10765284_1730137172965_pca_fig--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Principal Component Analysis of organic carbon composition in surface, subsurface active layer, and permafrost soil depths across 20 freeze-thaw cycles.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rooney et al., in prep</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erin&nbsp;C&nbsp;Rooney\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2138937/2138937_10765284_1730136933631_FTC_fig_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2138937/2138937_10765284_1730136933631_FTC_fig_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2138937/2138937_10765284_1730136933631_FTC_fig_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Freeze-thaw cycles at the Acidic tundra wet site that fluctuate above and below  0 degrees Celsius for 2 hours each.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rooney et al., in prep</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erin&nbsp;C&nbsp;Rooney\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
