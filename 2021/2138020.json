 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made as part of the FY 2021 Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (MPS-Ascend). Each fellowship supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical and physical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. This fellowship to Dr. Vanessa Sanchez supports her research project entitled \"Active Textiles based on Supramolecular Shape Memory Polymer Fibers.\" The host institution for the fellowship is Stanford University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Zhenan Bao. \r\n\r\nDr. Sanchez's background spans from fashion design and materials chemistry to materials science, with experience in fabrication strategies, imaging, materials selection, mechanical testing of materials, circuitry, and textile architecture understanding. Her current research is on materials synthesis and knitting techniques that allow a designer to translate design requirements for wearable sensors and actuators into knit patterns. The goal of the proposed fellowship is to develop a novel class of shape-memory polymers for use in responsive textiles while simultaneously generating interest in materials research for underrepresented minority (URM) students. The outcomes of the research will lead broadly to scientific publications. Dr. Sanchez plans to serve as a role model and mentor for Latino STEM students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
