 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) and Chemical Research Instrumentation programs.  Arkansas State University is acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer that has the capabilities to perform both routine analysis and more complex experiments to help elucidate molecular structures of chemical compounds. The instrument supports the research of Professor M. Abrar Alam and colleagues Fabricio Medina-Bolivar, Hashim Ali, John Hershberger and Allyn Ontko.  The spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as developing synthetic methodologies to synthesize scaffolds and molecules having potential biological activity, and studying biosynthetic pathways of plant-based stilbenoids.  In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate students in chemistry.  Students from local high schools and student participating in on-campus research programs for underrepresented minorities also benefit from using this state of the art equipment.\r\n\r\nThe award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels.  It especially impacts the development of methodologies to facilitate the structure elucidation of small and medium-sized molecules.  The instrumentation is also used to study persistent emerging organic contaminants and polymeric asphalt binders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
