 "awd_abstract_narration": "Immunology is a content-heavy, rapidly-evolving field, which makes \u201ckeeping up\u201d difficult for instructors. The inclusion of immunology-related topics in undergraduate biology curricula at an introductory level is limited due to lack of faculty expertise and/or costly resources required for immunology labs. Yet, immunology is important for training the next generation of scientists and medical professionals. Demystifying immunology\u2019s discipline-specific knowledge to encourage public dialogue has the potential to positively impact numerous societal issues, such as promoting acceptance of vaccines leading to an increase in the rate of immunization. Interdisciplinary thinking fostered by immunology is also critical to tackle current societal challenges, such as the effect of global climate change on emerging infectious diseases. \r\n\r\nThe Immunology network will connect educators who are committed to interdisciplinary undergraduate immunology education and active learning. The network will develop teaching resources that integrate immunology related interdisciplinary learning outcomes, for example those intersecting with ecology and chemistry. These interdisciplinary learning outcomes aligned with the key concepts and competencies noted in The Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action report, will be identified with feedback from the educator community. Non-immunology educators, representing diverse institutional and disciplinary expertise, will be paired with an immunology educator for developing these interdisciplinary teaching resources, based on backward design approach and active learning strategies. The products generated at the end of this RCN-UBE incubator, will be shared with the network participants at a virtual symposium, disseminated for use by educators at the American Society for Microbiology Conference for Undergraduate Educators and as an Open Educational Resource via the QUBES hub site. The network will result in significant professional development opportunities for faculty and empower them to positively impact diverse student populations including underrepresented and first-generation students and veterans.\r\n\r\nThis project is being funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The group?s work resulted in the recruitment and engagement of twenty-two participants from across the U.S. and abroad. These network participants represent diverse educational settings (R1 and R2 research institutions, four-year degree-granting institutions and community colleges) located in rural, suburban, urban and international communities. In addition to institution type and setting, the network includes individuals from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM and features expertise from a variety of disciplines including ecology and evolutionary biology, biochemistry, biology education research, neuroscience, microbiology, anatomy and physiology, and genetics. This rich diversity allowed us to develop a suite of eleven interdisciplinary activities for non-major and major courses that upon implementation, will allow for increased access to the discipline of immunology across undergraduate curricula. By implementing these activities, immunology education will become increasingly accessible for undergraduate STEM majors, beyond traditional upper-level, one-semester niche elective courses that will ultimately create a learned public that is more ?immune literate.? The activities designed by network participants are aligned with the core concepts and competencies of the Vision and Change report (AAAS, 2011) and incorporate accessible, evidence-based active learning strategies. The activities and the information about these activities were disseminated through faculty presentations at the American Society for Microbiology Conference for Undergraduate Educators (ASMCUE-2022), through an invited article in the American Association of Immunologists newsletter, and a podcast on Microbe.tv/Immune. The ecosystem of the network was that of a community of practice, featuring diversity in terms of career stage, professional experiences, and disciplinary expertise. As a result, mentor-mentee relationships were fostered and discussions addressed core barriers to undergraduate immunology education reform. Discussions were facilitated through one-on-one virtual meetings, biweekly seminars (ImmunoReach symposia) and a semester-long Faculty Mentoring Network organized in collaboration with the BioQUEST Curriculum Consortium.
