 "awd_abstract_narration": "During a high energy geophysical survey along the Cascadia Subduction Zone, measurements of sound pressure and particle motion will be made to investigate potential impacts of sound on fishes and invertebrates. Using a vector sensor array, which is an underwater listening device used to detect sounds in water, the PIs would use this data to assess behavioral responses of rockfishes (Sebastes spp), Dungeness crab, and longnose skate to the sound resulting from the geophysical survey.  This survey provides a unique opportunity to characterize ocean noise and investigate the responses of nearshore Northeast Pacific species.  The results of this project would be of scientific interest to advance understanding of the energetics of acoustic propagation and responses of marine species to geophysical surveys.\r\n\r\nA vector sensor array will be used to provide in-situ measurements of acoustic particle motion and pressure amplitude levels as a quantifiable description of the environmental acoustic stress induced by the seismic survey. This approach will enable the PIs to evaluate changes in the bioacoustic soundscape during and after the seismic survey relative to pre-survey conditions. This study will be an opportunity to obtain valuable and relatively unique nearshore acoustic data from a seismic sound source that can be used to validate and improve sound propagation models in these challenging nearshore coastal areas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
