 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a cold plasma-based wound healing device. Most currently available advanced therapeutic devices are costly and require lengthy treatment times, which has inhibited adoption in both veterinary and human therapeutic applications. This device is aimed at aiding diabetic and other recurrent or chemically resistant infected wounds.  In addition, cold plasma may be used in other applications including aerospace and food sectors as well as in  sterilization industries.  The proposed technology is based on the development of a cold plasma versus cell interactions. The technology utilizes surface discharge to generate plasma to convert various molecules in the air into useful radicals. The device itself will have a handheld form factor to allow for mobility, rapid deployment, and quick treatment using the technology. Further development of this technology may lead to several other cold plasma applications.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a device to deliver cold plasma for wound healing applications. The proposed technology delivers cold plasma directly to wound sites over a short treatment time (measured in minutes), that will promote wound healing, reduce overall bed rest, and lessen the use of topical ointments formulated for surface wound healing. The technology utilizes a physical means to disinfect wounds allowing it to treat chemically resistant infections. Additionally, the technology utilizes plasma-generated radical species to promote late phase inflammation and wound contraction through the activation of fibroblast cells that induce the production of collagen. The technology is designed to deliver cold plasma through a device to promote wound healing while maintaining a level of sterilization to prevent reinfection. The device may be manipulated allowing for the treatment of a large variety of wound sizes.  Various studies have shown that the technology may produce up to a 25% reduction in wound healing time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
