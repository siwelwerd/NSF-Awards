If successful, this instrument will be of broad use to the community with important applications spanning quantification of rising methane-and biologically-rich plumes at sites of gas hydrates, to monitoring changes in currents along continental margins impacted by ocean acidification and anoxia events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
