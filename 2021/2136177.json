 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial travel support for junior U.S. participants to attend the 14th International Conference on the Fundamentals of Adsorption (FOA14) which will take place on May 22-27, 2022 in Broomfield, Colorado. The FOA series of conferences is the premier international conference in the field of adsorption, organized by the International Adsorption Society. A hallmark of the conference is its comprehensive coverage of the spectrum of fundamental research and applications of adsorption, ranging from molecular modeling and simulation of fluids adsorbed in porous materials to the design of pressure swing adsorption systems for industrial gas separation processes. Research in these topical areas has far-reaching societal implications, including mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and reducing industrial energy consumption. The FOA meeting is held triennially and is attended by researchers from all over the world. The attendees represent a wide range of academic disciplines, including chemical engineering, chemistry, physics, and materials science and engineering, among others, and the level of industrial participation is high. The meeting format includes a series of keynote, plenary, and invited talks, technical presentations, and poster sessions. Thus, the conference provides an excellent forum for the exchange of ideas and information between scientists and engineers in academia and industrial practitioners in the field. \r\n\r\nThe 14th International Conference on the Fundamentals of Adsorption meeting will feature technical sessions, daily poster sessions, and networking functions to encourage the cross-pollination of ideas and to establish new collaborations. The key themes of the meeting include fundamentals of adsorption, thermodynamics, and kinetics; molecular simulation of adsorption phenomena; adsorbent materials including zeolites, carbons, silicas, and metal-organic frameworks; characterization of adsorbent materials; liquid-phase and gas-phase adsorption processes; pressure swing adsorption and simulated moving bed processes; biotechnology applications of adsorption; energy applications of adsorption; and environmental applications of adsorption. The FOA14 organizing committee is a diverse group of researchers from academia, industry, and U.S. national laboratories whose expertise spans the array of technical topics. The meeting is unique in its focus on fundamental adsorption science. The award will support the participation of graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and junior tenure-track faculty members from U.S. educational institutions and not-for-profit research institutions. A primary objective of these travel subsidies is to encourage participation among members of the research community who might otherwise be unable to participate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
