 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Laura Schmitt Olabisi at Michigan State University, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist investigating the relationships between smallholder livelihoods and agricultural biodiversity in the state of Michigan. The state of Michigan provides a unique opening for inquiry into these dynamic relationships. It is at once one of the most diversified agricultural industries in the country, a highly heterogeneous social and physical farming landscape, and home to some of the country\u2019s leading agricultural research institutions, extension services, and field stations. Three important questions have been insufficiently explored in interdisciplinary scientific research: First, how do those involved in small scale farming conceive of and engage biological diversity? Second, how do these relationships vary within and across lines of social difference, particularly gender, class, and race? Third, how do these relationships shape agrobiodiversity conservation and livelihood outcomes and whose purposes do they serve as a result.\r\n\r\nThis research promises important contributions at multiple levels, from theory to practice. It advances the literature on the political ecology of agricultural development, which tends to take for granted the framing of subsistence and commercial agricultural systems as mutually exclusive paradigms, by unpacking how different actors negotiate these systems in relation to one another. Interdisciplinary scholarly work has highlighted a need for case studies and theoretically-rigorous analyses that directly relate particular geographies of agricultural practice to broad economic, political, and institutional change. The responses of small-scale commercially- and subsistence-oriented farmers to recent economic restructuring and volatility in the United States remain understudied, as does Michigan as an agricultural region. This research also studies the perspectives, practices, and decision-making processes of community organizers, agricultural scientists, and extension agents, thus responding directly to calls within geography for livelihood analyses of actors within development and political institutions. An innovative methodology centered on the triangulation of ethnographic observation with interviews and participatory modeling will illuminate how relationships between smallholders, agrobiodiversity, and development institutions have developed over time, providing critical insight into what interventions and policies might better support and sustainable and just agricultural future. The proposed research investigates the complex relationships between smallholder livelihoods and agricultural diversity using two distinct yet synergistic methodological approaches: 1) ethnographic study of farmers\u2019 everyday lives, including their spaces of work and leisure; and 2) participatory modeling of farming system dynamics. The training and professional development proposed here will prepare the Fellowship Candidate for a lifelong career of advancing scientific understanding of complex social and agricultural systems, to serve underrepresented student groups and increase diversity in the interdisciplinary sciences, and to contribute to international environmental assessments and policy-making.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
