 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, located in Madison, WI, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2021- 2023. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an underrepresented group, will be trained in the program. Students will investigate how diversity in genotype and the environment as well as interactions between genotype and the environment lead to diverse characteristics, or phenotypes. The REU program will prepare students to meet this challenge by supporting development of their observation skills and their ability to approach complex problems from multiple experimental directions. These skills are required to address challenges such as how organisms respond to stresses and how to target plant and animal breeding to sustainably feed and fuel the growing human population. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done thru the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nThis REU will train students to understand how observable traits and phenotypes are influenced by genotype and environmental conditions. The program includes diverse projects with research groups from nine bioscience departments (Bacteriology, Biochemistry, Biomolecular Chemistry, Botany, Comparative Biosciences, Entomology, Integrative Biology, Medical Genetics, and Neurology). Students will participate in seminars and workshops to sharpen their research skills of observation, critical thinking, communication, research ethics, and creativity. Students will learn strategies to navigate the research process and will learn ways to develop an effective relationship with their mentors. They will acquire skills and knowledge that will help enhance student success in graduate school. Students should apply online. Applications are reviewed holistically by the PI, Co-PI, and faculty mentor. More information about the program is available by visiting https://wiscience.wisc.edu/IBS-SRP, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Amber Smith at amber.smith@wisc.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. David Wassarman at dawassarman@wisc.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
