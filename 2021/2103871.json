 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2021 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Organellar Channels and Transporters will be held from Aug 8th-13th in Castelldefels, Spain. The GRC will be preceded (Aug 7th-8th, 2021) by the associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) which is organized by and for young scientists. The meetings aim to capture the most recent discoveries in the field of cellular channels and transporters and processes associated with them. The meetings will consist of platform sessions, short talks, poster sessions, and discussions. This will provide ample opportunity for sharing the latest research results as well as technical and conceptual advances, for exploring collaborative possibilities, and for identifying new ways to break the technical barriers. The GRS will be a special platform to attract students and postdoctoral fellows to come to the GRC following the GRS. The GRC also focuses on diversity and strong representation from women and underrepresented minority groups. \r\n\r\nThis combined GRC/GRS meeting will represent a unique opportunity to gather scientists facing technical and conceptual challenges in the study of a wide variety of organelles, including endosomes, microvesicles, lysosomes, vacuoles, mitochondria, chloroplasts, the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, secretory vesicles and the primary cilium in the animal, plant, prokaryotes, and fungal systems. Importantly, techniques or concepts developed for the study of one type of organelle could spark ideas and provide new insights to the studies of other organelles. Both the GRC and GRS provide important training opportunity for early- career scientists to present and discuss their research with top scientists in the field and with each other.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
