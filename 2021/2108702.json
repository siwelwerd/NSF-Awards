 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the early Universe, the intergalactic medium (IGM) is largely filled with diffuse hydrogen and helium gas. The IGM is distributed in a cosmic web of sheets and filaments, separated by voids. Galaxies form at the intersections of these structures and are fed by IGM gas falling onto regions surrounding galaxies called the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Principal Investigators Kim and Wakker will analyze archival data to study the complex interaction between gas accretion from the IGM and galactic outflows in the CGM, which controls star formation efficiency and mediates galaxy evolution. To broaden participation the PIs will organize a series of research related public talks and develop an online exhibit through the University of Wisconsin Space Place. The PIs will also continue to work with local middle and high schools to increase student participation in the annual Science Olympiad tournament.\r\n\r\nThe PIs will estimate the temperature and turbulence of the diffuse CGM/IGM at 2<z<4 by determining the absorption line widths and column densities of HI, CIV and SiIV ions based on Voigt profile fitting analysis of ~170 QSO spectra from publicly archived Keck Observatory Database of Ionized Absorption toward Quasars (KODIAQ) and the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) Spectral Quasar Absorption Database (SQUAD). The quasars span the epoch when the cosmic star formation rate triples between z ~ 4 and z ~ 2, and when helium reionization heats the IGM significantly at z ~ 3. The PIs will use their results to test theoretical models of the temperature-density relation of the CGM and the evolution of gas temperature and turbulence of the IGM/CGM at high redshifts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The IGM is distributed like spider webs known as the Cosmic Web, tracing underlying dark matter (the upper-left panel of Figure 1). Galaxies form at the intersections of the IGM webs. The IGM continuously falls onto the circumgalactic region surrounding galaxies and supplies fresh fuel for future star formation.

A large community of astrophysical theorists is running state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. One prediction from these simulations is the temperature evolution of the IGM and CGM over time. The interplay between cooling due to Hubble expansion and heating from the extragalactic radiation field characterized by the HI photoionization rate (the middle panel of Figure 2) establishes a minimum temperature for both the IGM and CGM. In regions of higher-density CGM, additional heating from gravitational shocks and galactic-scale outflows is counterbalanced by increased cooling mechanisms involving elements other than hydrogen and helium. A minimum temperature (or the parameter \"b\") is predicted to have a positive correlation with density (or the parameter \"N(HI)\") in the IGM, but an anti-correlation in the CGM, with a redshift-dependent turnover separating the IGM from the CGM (the middle panel of Figure 1).<br /><br />The IGM temperature has been extensively studied both observationally and theoretically over the past two decades, particularly at redshifts greater than 2 when a large amount of high-fidelity observational data is available. In contrast, the CGM temperature has received less attention, primarily because studying it requires significantly larger samples; CGM gas is at least five times rarer than IGM gas.<br /><br />To test the validity of the fundamental prediction regarding CGM temperature from simulations, we analyzed about 100 underutilized, publicly available QSO spectra from the HIRES KODIAQ and UVES SQUAD projects at high redshifts (2 &lt; <em>z </em>&lt; 4) when the universe was between 1.7 and 3.5 billion years old. This period also coincides with a threefold increase in the cosmic star formation rate from <em>z</em>~4 to <em>z</em>~2, producing more high-energy photons (the upper panel of Figure 2).

The IGM/CGM gas temperature, as measured from co-spatial hydrogen and three-times ionized carbon (a sample size five times larger than previous studies), shows no significant changes with the median temperature of 34000 K (the magenta dashed line in the lower panel of Figure 2), independent of the cosmic star formation rate and the intensity of the extragalactic radiation field.
