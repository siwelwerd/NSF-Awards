 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract:\r\n\r\nSpin-triplet superconductivity is an exotic quantum phenomenon rarely identified in real materials, making it of fundamental physical interest to understand how it works. Spin-triplet superconductivity is also being pursued as a potential platform for future quantum computing applications. This project is an experimental investigation of the properties of spin-triplet superconductivity at high magnetic fields using multiple measurement techniques. A research focus is the recently discovered material, uranium ditelluride, that has numerous unusual physical properties, the most outstanding of which is the presence of a new high-field superconducting phase whose origins are not well understood. This research advances fundamental physical understanding of electron correlations, emergent properties in the presence of multiple competing interactions, and their role in spin-triplet superconductivity. This research program trains a postdoctoral researcher, contributes to the training of junior researchers in quantum materials synthesis and measurement, and utilizes national scientific user facilities to perform specialized experiments. The program contributes to public outreach activities and educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: \r\n\r\nThe physics of spin-triplet superconductivity is of great fundamental interest as examples of this phenomenon are rare in real materials. Classification and realization of topological superconductivity is also of applied interest, as researchers look for promising platforms on which to develop fault-tolerant quantum computing. This project focuses on the high magnetic field phases and properties of the spin triplet superconductor uranium ditelluride and related materials. This leading candidate for intrinsic topological superconductivity has a remarkably rich high-field phase diagram, including the highest-field reentrant superconducting phase between approximately 40 and 65 teslas, which is believed to be driven by reduced electron dimensionality. The team performs targeted high magnetic field measurements, including transport, magnetometry, and calorimetry, on uranium ditelluride and related materials to identify and understand these new and unusual forms of high-field electronic order. These measurements precisely define the complicated high-field phase boundaries of uranium ditelluride and related materials, give insight into what stabilizes these emergent phases and their microscopic order parameters. The project advances understanding of electron correlations, emergent properties in the presence of multiple competing interactions, and unconventional superconductivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
