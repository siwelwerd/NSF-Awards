 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving participation of community college faculty with professional disciplinary societies. Since community colleges teach an estimated 44 percent of U.S. undergraduate students, they play a critical role in the education of undergraduates and hold tremendous potential to expand and diversify the field of emerging STEM professionals. Recent reports have recommended that scientific societies do more to engage full and part-time community college faculty.  Through increased interaction, faculty will have the opportunity to engage in discipline specific professional development that represents the current state of affairs with respect to careers in the field. A multi-day virtual workshop will promote strategies for partnerships between community college instructors and their respective professional disciplinary societies to foster more inclusive teaching practices, enhance transfer and career opportunities for students, and promote a more diverse workforce.  \r\n\r\nParticipants in the virtual workshop will include faculty, administrative, and professional society leaders. Together they will explore how to support community college faculty in their teaching and professional development through expanded involvement with professional societies. The workshop conveners are the co-editors of a 2021 New Directions for Community Colleges publication Partners in Progress: Community College Faculty and Disciplinary Societies. The workshop will be hosted by the Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College with expected attendance of 75-100 participants over the course of three days. The workshop website and the associated report will be distributed to all participants, professional disciplinary societies, and will be available to all in the professional and academic scientific community. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "A virtual workshop, Strengthening Engagement between Disciplinary Societies and Community Colleges, took place over four days in January 2022. The workshop built on ideas from the edited volume, Community College Faculty and Engagement with Disciplinary Societies (Maier, Rowell, &amp; Macdonald, 2021) in New Directions for Community Colleges, issue 194, which included chapters from 11 disciplines. \nThe workshop promoted the exchange of effective practices for partnerships between community college instructors and their respective disciplinary societies and brought together over 100 registered participants from across the country representing 13 STEM and humanities disciplines. Participants included community college faculty, administrators, teaching and learning center directors, disciplinary society staff and leaders, and education researchers. Together they explored how to strengthen engagement between community college faculty and their respective disciplinary societies for mutual benefit and developed disciplinary and cross-disciplinary visions and plans for the future.  \nThrough discipline-specific and multidisciplinary small group discussions, participants shared what was working well and what could be improved in the relationship between community colleges and disciplinary societies. They made the following recommendations. \nBuild stronger relationships between disciplinary societies and community colleges. Community college faculty should be part of the fabric of their disciplinary society, including serving on committees and in leadership positions. Community college administrators and teaching and learning centers directors could also promote and support engagement of community college faculty with disciplinary societies. \nSupport diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).
