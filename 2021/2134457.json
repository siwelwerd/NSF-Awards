 "awd_abstract_narration": "The COVID-19 pandemic not only changed the discourse on how we conduct our lives and tested the limits of our healthcare system but it also raised important questions as to how to prepare better for the next pandemic. During the height of the COVID-19, the lack of rapid detection, the ability to accurately monitor the spread of the disease, and determine who had already been exposed to the virus caused a large amount of uncertainty (and anxiety) and demonstrates the needs for facile, inexpensive, and scalable sensing platforms to help address the most rudimentary questions being raised by our public health officials. The objectives of this NSF award are to bring researchers together at all levels (i.e., students, early career, and senior researchers) from diverse fields to present and discuss new development and cutting-edge tools related to all aspects of chemical/biological sensing technology and its translation into practice. In particular, this NSF award supports students and early career researchers, who will be exposed in a forum where they can: (1) intermingle with researchers that have translated their sensor technology along with researchers who are exposed to the 'real-world' challenges, (2) develop collaborations across disciplines for new and established researchers in their field, (3) facilitate networking and career-building opportunities for the early-stage researchers/students, and (4) enhance participation of women and other underrepresented groups in this field. A dedicated symposium entitled, \"Biosensors and Nanoscale Measurements\" will span four days (October 11-14, 2021) at the 240th Electrochemical Society (ECS) Meeting in Orlando, Florida.\r\n\r\nThe objective of \"Biosensors and Nanoscale Measurements\" symposium at the 240th ECS Meeting is to provide a venue for students, junior, and senior researchers to exchange scientific ideas, present cutting-edge research, and expose participants to a diverse array of chemical/biosensing topics with pragmatic factors and understanding implementation challenges to deploying emerging technologies for end-users. Emerging technologies for sensing will enable the next-generation of cyber-physical systems (CPS) for improved personalized health monitoring, with real-time sensing and learning, as well as interoperability for a more comprehensive network coverage and to better prepare us for the next crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic illustrated the need for timely translation and more importantly understanding 'real-world' needs, integration, adoption, and implementation of any sensor technology is as critical than simply understanding a transduction mechanism or characterization of a sensor platform in a purified environment. The Symposium will be attended by both prominent and early career researchers/trainees in sensors and nanoscale measurements from around the world, who will be discussing present and future directions of research, research challenges and its implementation to real-world applications. The Symposium greatly benefits every participant due to the interdisciplinary nature of chemical/biosensing and will foster cross-fertilization of ideas among these diverse group of researchers. Moreover, this NSF award increases participation of young scientists and engineers, who would not otherwise be able to afford to travel to the meeting and contribute, to build their careers by interacting in person with colleagues, including more senior researchers. The demand for sensor technology to determine and monitor the effects on human health is critically important and diverse thinking is needed to accelerate the revolution that will take place to meet the challenges of the next pandemic and in advancing the field for the betterment of other societal needs (e.g., climate change, food infrastructure, overall health/wellbeing, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
