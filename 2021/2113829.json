 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Math For All in New Orleans Conference will be held virtually on March 5-7, 2021. The overall goal of the Math For All in New Orleans conference is to increase diversity in mathematics and expose mathematicians in the Greater New Orleans area to the wide variety of research available at nearby institutions. Due to this year\u2019s virtual format, many participants will be also attending from different parts of the United States. The conference will include four broadly accessible plenary talks, six contributed research sessions, a diverse career panel, two workshops and a poster session. Through these avenues, the conference is designed to engage undergraduate and graduate students into a community of mathematics and prepare them for future careers in the field. The plenary speakers and panelists come from around the United States, representing multiple ethnic and mathematical backgrounds, giving students visible role models in industry and academia with whom they can identify. Participants will have the opportunity to present research and attend professional development workshops in a welcoming and inclusive environment.\r\n \r\nThe conference will strive to make mathematics more accessible to underrepresented groups, ultimately increasing diversity in the field. The conference will have participants representing HBCUs and smaller universities in the New Orleans area, with the goal of exposing them to a broad mathematical research community. These aspects of the conference help students be better prepared to transition to research-focused environments, which will increase retention of underrepresented groups in the mathematical fields. The conference will also stimulate discussions amongst faculty on inclusive pedagogy aimed at advancing students from underrepresented groups. The organizing committee is dedicated to amplifying the voices of underrepresented minorities in mathematics by highlighting the importance of representation, allyship, and individual actions towards changing systemic forms of oppression in mathematics. \r\n \r\nConference Website: http://www.math.tulane.edu/mathforallnola\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
