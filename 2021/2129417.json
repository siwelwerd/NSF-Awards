 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, Big Data has become a ubiquitous term. Big Data is transforming science, engineering, medicine, healthcare, finance, business, and ultimately society itself. The IEEE Big Data has established itself as the top tier research conference in Big Data. The 2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE Big Data 2021) will continue the success of the previous IEEE Big Data conferences and provides a leading forum for disseminating the latest research and education in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data research, development, and applications.  This work will support student attendees at the 2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData-2021).\r\n\r\nThe scientific program of IEEE Big Data 2021 will cover synergistic themes on Big Data Science and Foundations, Big Data Learning and Analytics, Big Data Infrastructure, Big Data Management, Big Data Search and Mining, Big Data Security & Privacy, Ethics, Privacy and Trust in Big Data Systems, and Big Data Applications. The IEEE Big Data 2021 promises to have great scientific quality and broad impact, with world-renowned scientists as keynote speakers and invited speakers, contributed talks at a highly competitive acceptance rate (the IEEE Big Data regular paper acceptance rate is always less than 20% since its inception), special issue publications in top scientific journals such as IEEE Transactions on Big Data as well as the board participation of the research community serving on the Program Committee and the organizing committees for workshops, tutorials and posters. As an effort to engage young researchers, the NSF student travel award will stimulate research discussion for students in underrepresented groups. It will also enhance the workforce training for students in the artificial intelligence and data science fields\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
