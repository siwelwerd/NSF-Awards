 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Community Instruments and Facilities (CIF) award will provide funding for the support of a truck-mounted Rapid scan X-band Polarimetric (RaXPol) radar as a community instrument. Development of the radar was originally funded by the NSF Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program in 2008. The CIF RaXPol award will provide community access to a rapid-scan, highly flexible, dual-polarization radar that can enable new scientific discoveries and provide unique educational opportunities. Rapid scan radar data can enable novel research in tornadogenesis, deep convection and electrification, post-wildfire hydrology and flash floods, lake-effect and orographic snowstorms, and tropical cyclones. The radar will also be used as an educational and outreach tool, providing opportunities for students to interact with state-of-the-art instrumentation. RaXPol will be maintained by the Advanced Radar Research Center (ARRC) at the University of Oklahoma, which has long-standing experience in design and operation of complex radar systems.\r\n\r\nRaXPol provides rapid updates of direct and reliable dual-polarization weather observations which are much needed for the study of high impact and fast evolving weather events. It can be rapidly deployed with real-time data transmission capabilities and offers flexibility in scanning strategies to focus observations on areas of interest at high spatiotemporal resolution. The mobile RaXPol facility can travel to different locations for scientific exploration and research which allows diverse institutions and underrepresented groups to engage in learning experience with hands-on activities.  This award will enhance the ability of the broader scientific community to use the radars through the Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences facility request process.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
