 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drought-induced forest die-off is a global phenomenon with far-reaching ecological and economic impacts. In the western US, tree death from drought, high temperatures, and bark beetle outbreaks now exceeds forest growth. Despite increases in the frequency and severity of drought-related insect outbreaks, factors influencing a tree's susceptibility to insect herbivores, such as the presence of chemical defenses, have received little attention. In particular, it is unclear how drought causes trees to shift resources toward or away from the chemical defenses that deter insect attacks and the subsequent trade-offs that exist with other important plant functions. To address this critical knowledge gap, this study focuses on how pinon pine trees allocate their carbon resources toward defense and other physiological processes under increasing drought stress to avoid death by drought or bark beetle attack. This study uses an isotope labeling approach in both greenhouse and field experiments to track drought-induced changes in carbon allocation to specific chemical compounds that affect bark beetle choice and success. The project increases participation of Native American students through undergraduate recruitment for summer research assistantships as well as other underrepresented minorities in science through the development of two critical thinking modules and support for their adoption in rural middle school classrooms across Montana. \r\n\r\nThe rate of tree mortality has increased across the globe yet the understanding of the mechanisms underlying tree death remains surprisingly limited. Most work to date on drought-related tree death has focused on understanding the coupled roles of carbon starvation and hydraulic failure, but drought is oftentimes accompanied by insect outbreaks that cause or contribute to tree mortality. Research has yet to determine when trees cease investment in effective chemical defenses against biotic attack along the continuum of drought stress, and how these shifts in carbon availability simultaneously impact other plant physiological processes. This study seeks a mechanistic understanding of how drought stress affects the interactions among tree hydraulic function, carbohydrate availability, and chemical defense. Using both greenhouse experiments and field drought manipulations this research will couple enzyme assays with the use of stable isotopes to identify mechanisms responsible for shifts in pinon pine allocation of recently fixed carbon at the level of individual compounds with known impacts on bark beetle behavior. These methods will also allow identification of trade-offs involved in the synthesis of defense compounds at different drought severities while also advancing fundamental understanding of tree physiology and whole tree C budgets. By providing a comprehensive understanding of the effects of drought-induced physiological stress on mechanisms determining defense against bark beetles, a new, more complete framework for assessing mechanisms of tree mortality will be developed.  This research was co-funded by the Integrated Ecological Physiology Program in IOS/BIO and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We conducted experiments in the greenhouse with transplanted pi&ntilde;on pine, and with trees of the same species growing in the field, in the landscape where they are found naturally in central New Mexico. In the greenhouse we had more control over water available to plants and other environmental factors, such as temperature, but we worked with mature, transplanted trees in large pots. In the field we worked with trees grown in their natural habitat, but we had less control over our environmental conditions. However, we installed three large plots (1600 m<sup>2</sup>) with rainout shelters around groups of trees, troughs which caught rain and snow and funneled this moisture away from trees. We installed tree rain-out shelters in January 2020, each with troughs that covered approximately 45%, 75%, and 90% of the plot, and we used a 45% shelter with the same design that had been installed at the same site since 2010, a legacy of a previous experiment. This enabled us to assess recent responses to drought, but also long-term responses with our legacy drought treatment.</p>\n<p>Our experiment benefitted from several years of background drought in New Mexico due to the influence of La Ni&ntilde;a, and a bark beetle outbreak. This resulted in almost half of the trees in our newly installed rainout shelters dying by the end of 2022, providing us the opportunity to understand tree stress and its effect on defenses across a full range of conditions. Over four years of the field drought experiment, we made detailed measurements of tree photosynthesis, water loss, tension in the xylem (water transporting tissue), growth, exudation of defensive resin from the tree trunk, and concentrations of sugar, starch, and a variety of defense-related compounds in various parts of the tree. Defense-related measurements of chemical compounds and the flow of resin from the trunk were also made after trees were exposed to a fungal species vectored by bark beetles, to understand how trees defenses might be altered when under both drought stress and insect-fungi attack. In our greenhouse experiment we made similar measurements but also restricted transport of sugars to the site of fungal attack and added detailed assessments of the water pressure in tree tissues.</p>\n<p>We believe the dataset produced from these experiments is novel and globally unique, as no other research has carried out a set of such comprehensive and integrative measurements on how tree drought stress influences defense, and ultimately, death or survival within natural conifer populations. With large-scale tree mortality events increasing in frequency and extent world-wide because of hotter droughts and bark beetles, it is more important than ever to understand the mechanism driving forest susceptibility to destructive disturbances. We expect that publication of the results from this project will change the overall understanding of drought and bark beetled induced tree mortality, which would not have occurred without the funding of this project by NSF. This project has already led to the successful publication of nine papers in peer-reviewed journals, with another currently in review, and three more nearly ready to submit. Project results have also been communicated through 45 presentations at scientific meetings of professional societies, in seminars given at multiple universities, and in two episodes of an environmental science podcast run by high school students. This research led to the training of three postdocs, six graduate students, 30 undergraduates including one REU students, and two field technicians. These early-career researchers were trained in a variety of field measurements and laboratory procedures, including through three workshops where they received hands-on training of the primary methods used in each laboratory of the principal investigators (PIs). Many of these project participants have now taken their careers to the next stage by building on the experience they gained on this project and some are now advising students in these same techniques in their own lab groups. The project PIs also included the hypotheses, approach, and results of this research into multiple courses at their respective institutions, including through virtual guest lectures in each other&rsquo;s classes. We also conducted an authentic research experience for teachers, where three high school science educators participated in field research and developed lesson plans organized around translating this research for an AP Environmental Science class. These lessons will be disseminated to their classrooms but also beyond those of our teacher participants through the creation of open-access data-driven learning modules.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/21/2024<br>\nModified by: Henry&nbsp;D&nbsp;Adams</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2139080/2139080_10560820_1713742549773_IMG_20220621_103453302--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2139080/2139080_10560820_1713742549773_IMG_20220621_103453302--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Research Experience for Teachers\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2139080/2139080_10560820_1713742549773_IMG_20220621_103453302--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Research Experience for Teachers\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Project PI Dr. Amy Trowbridge explains field measurements to three high school teachers who participated in the research in June 2022.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Henry Adams</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Henry&nbsp;D&nbsp;Adams\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Research Experience for Teachers</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2139080/2139080_10560820_1713741861135_IMG_20220623_070243918--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2139080/2139080_10560820_1713741861135_IMG_20220623_070243918--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dead tree\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2139080/2139080_10560820_1713741861135_IMG_20220623_070243918--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dead tree\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A tree dying from our drought experiment in combination with bark beetle attack</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Henry Adams</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Henry&nbsp;D&nbsp;Adams\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Dead tree</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2139080/2139080_10560820_1713741905073_IMG_20220623_073222677--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2139080/2139080_10560820_1713741905073_IMG_20220623_073222677--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dead trees\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2139080/2139080_10560820_1713741905073_IMG_20220623_073222677--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dead trees\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dead trees in our field experiment following three years of 90% reduction in precipitation and bark beetle attack</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Henry Adams</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Henry&nbsp;D&nbsp;Adams\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Dead trees</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2139080/2139080_10560820_1713742468368_IMG_20190621_074138510_HDR--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2139080/2139080_10560820_1713742468368_IMG_20190621_074138510_HDR--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"R.
