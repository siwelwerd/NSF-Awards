 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EAGER award tests a bold concept, to engage high school students with direct access to data and experiments on the International Space Station, and to use these assets in computer science courses to help students develop skills of data inquiry, analysis and exploration. Results from this pilot project will lead to subsequent work to develop and integrate these resources and activities into widely used high school computer science courses. This innovation confronts a real problem in computing education \u2013 how to have the data analysis components of computer science courses have richness, depth and engagement, so that students can develop and apply these essential skills. Taking advantage of the educational power and appeal of space exploration, and the many connections to key domains of computer science, the project will create and test an open-source Student Mission Control, providing high school students with centralized access to a wealth of data from on-orbit sensors, student experiments, science research and NASA\u2019s own mission control. They will also create and test a set of related learning activities with computer science applications, focusing specifically on data literacy, since this is of growing importance and a perennial challenge in computer science courses.\r\n\r\nThis EAGER project will design and implement a pilot curriculum to improve data literacy by engaging students with real data from the International Space Station. They will also design a Student Mission Control interface system that mimicks NASA\u2019s own Mission Control. The team will address the technical challenges of accessing data from the ISS, manage it in a dynamic data engine and create an engaging and informative user interface and API. They will also develop the related inquiry-based investigations and simulations that engage students\u2019 curiosity and promote data literacy skills. This pilot will work initially with the co-PI\u2019s computer science course for non-majors, and then deploy and test in high schools, with 20 teachers of computer science and their students. Lessons learned from this pilot project, if warranted, will in turn lead to a full proposal for large scale development, dissemination, training, and expansion of functions, learning activities and educational activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Once the SOOSS is on station, environmental sensor data will be downlinked and accessible via the website.  \n\n\n2.Curriculum  \n\n\nLeveraging real ISS data (historical and current), we created and tested a set of learning activities with computer science applications focused on data literacy that take 1-2 weeks of a high school class, 3-5 hours per week. Engaging students with current data from the ISS, we pull from ISS-MIMIC public telemetry feed (https://iss-mimic.github.io/Mimic/). Our curriculum focuses on three interactive labs, called \"Expeditions:\" Altitude, Orientation, and Life Support.  \n\n\n2.1 Altitude  \n\n\nStarting from an assumption that students knew the Python programming language and had no data science background, we begin the first Expedition by introducing tools the students will use, starting with Google Colab (Jupyter notebook and Python environment in a browser) and pandas Python data analysis library. The pedagogical technique during these introductory activities is referred to as \"GPS mode.\" Students follow directions like those given from a GPS; we provide the code to run (students click play for each code snippet) and ask students about the data and its interpretation.  \n\n\nThe Expedition analyzes historical data of the altitude of ISS during an interesting interval. It probes students on the shape of the data and the \"blip\" that occurred December 28, 2019, and then discusses orbital eccentricity and reboosts needed to realign the ISS.  \n\n\n2.2 Orientation  \n\n\nThis Expedition explores data relating to the orientation of station (measuring yaw, pitch, and roll). Students look at box plots of historical data to understand typical values and then look at a unique data set. In November 2021, the Russian NAUKA module\u2019s thrusters engaged when docked to station, causing the ISS to rotate out of control. We have students generate and analyze the yaw, pitch, and roll curves for this day. We then simulate the NAUKA incident. Students are introduced to this environment with a manual lunar lander-esque game and need to turn on the thrusters to reorient the ISS in vertical orientation. They are challenged with five programming levels of increasing complexity; they only need to author a single function (here, a Snap! block) to use autopilot to control the thrust depending on the angle, angular velocity, and fuel supply of the ISS.  \n\n\n2.3 Life Support  \n\n\nStudents explore life support telemetry data including temperature, water, and atmospheric composition and pressure. Unlike the previous Expeditions, this Expedition has students writing code and exploring the data self-directed. They learn about the temperature on station, the water filtration system, and that the atmosphere on station contains nitrogen as a fire suppressant. At the end, students are given a prompt and must use tools from the three Expeditions to discover an anomaly where the atmospheric pressure onboard the ISS dropped.  \n\n\n2.4 Student On-Orbit Sensor System (SOOSS)  \n\n\nSOOSS will provide access to an augmented set of orbital sensor data that can be directly accessed and uploaded to a Student Mission Control data hub for evaluation.  \n\n\n3. Professional Development  \n\n\nWe provided online professional development to 21 middle and high school teachers over two days. Teachers will teach the Student Mission Control materials during the Fall 2023-Spring 2024 school year and provide feedback.  \n\n\n4. Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts  \n\n\nWe have introduced a novel one- to two-week high school curriculum based on engaging data science activities centered around the ISS and designed a website as the home of our project. This has the potential to broaden participation in computing to underrepresented students, by engaging them in authentic, STEM-based data and visualizations, leveraging their interests in STEM and space exploration.\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Samantha M Thorstensen"
