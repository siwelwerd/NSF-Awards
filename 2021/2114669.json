 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quarks and gluons are fundamental building blocks of all the visible matter in the universe. They are described by the theory of strong nuclear interactions: quantum chromo-dynamics. A complete understanding of how the observed properties in the universe emerge from these interactions has remained elusive. Addressing open questions in quantum chromo-dynamics is a global effort. This design-track AccelNet project will focus on deeply fundamental questions: How did visible matter come into being, and how does it evolve? How does subatomic matter organize itself and what phenomena emerge? This project will focus on designing and establishing a network of networks across the United States, Canada and Latin America to accelerate the process of tackling quantum chromo-dynamics challenges in nuclear physics. It will enable the training of students, postdoctoral researchers, and early-career scientists in international multi-team nuclear physics projects that will have a strong participation of networks from this region. Such activities will promote the integration of nuclear physics communities across the Americas. It will also serve to identify ethics norms and scientific guidelines for U.S.-led network-to-network projects in nuclear physics.\r\n\r\nThis AccelNet project will engage the domestic and international network partners around four main goals: (1) develop strategic partnerships across the various nuclear physics research networks in the Americas; (2) identify the needs, strengths and synergies of network partners for developing U.S.-led large scale nuclear science projects; (3) design activities for researchers in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America that will facilitate leveraging complementary resources for quantum chromo-dynamics research, and (4) enhance the training of the next generation of researchers in nuclear physics in a novel set of skills that include international multi-team experience. To enable diverse network opportunities, the research themes will be broad, including research in theory, data analyses, high performance computing, particle detectors and accelerator technologies, real-time event selection, as well as software and Monte Carlo simulation development. Applications of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and quantum technologies, will also be part of the coordination effort. The activities will include scientific retreats, meetings, workshops, and the development of a website to facilitate coordination.  The project will also design and carry out exchange and mobility programs between networks in the U.S., Canada and Latin American countries. \r\n\r\nThe Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) program is designed to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and prepare the next generation of U.S. researchers for multiteam international collaborations. The AccelNet program supports strategic linkages among U.S. research networks and complementary networks abroad that will leverage research and educational resources to tackle grand scientific challenges that require significant coordinated international efforts.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by AccelNet Program and the Established program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
