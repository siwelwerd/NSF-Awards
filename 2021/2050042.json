 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to Clemson University, located in Clemson, South Carolina, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2021-2023. In this program, supported by the Division of Chemistry, participants select a research project in the broad area of materials with targeted functions, and they are placed into small teams mentored by a cluster of faculty mentors with complementary expertise. The research experience is supplemented by ethics training as well as an introduction to state-of-the-art instrumentation linked to the research projects. The program offers a number of workshops meant to enhance the experience of the participants, their professional development, and their research-related social competencies. These activities improve participants' ability to interact in professional settings and network, highlight the relevance of their research experience, and help them become advocates for diversity and inclusion in chemistry.\r\n\r\nStudents at the Clemson CHE-REU site will be engaged in individual projects encompassing a broad swath of chemistry, with an emphasis on materials with targeted functions. Projects offered include the synthesis and characterization of novel organic and inorganic materials; development of methods to unveil chemical interactions of nanoparticles; preparation of deep eutectic solvents; and new approaches to enhancing energy harvesting. A planned professional development series will accompany the research experience and will include seminars on collecting, analyzing and communicating scientific results; integrating and cultivating professional networks; and applying REU competencies to build future careers. Embracing social, economic and cultural diversity, this program aims to recruit non-traditional/high potential students, minority students from South Carolina and surrounding minority serving institutions, students in military schools, and students from distant geographic areas.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To accomplish this, 35 students partipated in our program performed research in projects linked to&nbsp;<span>Materials with Targeted Functions</span>. The selected areas allowed exposing participants to a broad research experience across disciplines and to take advantage of the concept of cluster mentoring. As a new element, also steaming from comments from past participants, the program also targeted social competencies. These activities had the goal of improving the participant&rsquo;s ability to interact in professional settings, highlight the relevance of their research experience, and networking, and becoming advocates for chemistry. The research experience was supplemented by ethics training as well as an introduction to state-of-the-art instrumentation linked to their projects. The program also offered a number of workshops to enhance the experience of the participants and their professional development. Non-traditional/high potential students, students from the State of SC and surrounding states, students in military schools, and students from distant geographic areas were strongly encouraged to apply. Students were required to form teams with existing students enabling a closer interaction between peers, as well as training experience to the junior mentor. Students will be expected to remain engaged in research activities and to present the results of the program in a scientific meeting.</p>\r\n<p><strong>External Evaluation</strong>:&nbsp;Overall, students, faculty mentors, and research advisors enjoyed and found value in the Clemson IMPRESS REU during all years of the project implementation. As noted in the Year Two evaluation report, the project was successful in helping students from multiple majors and universities across the nation to learn about a new form of research, to better understand career opportunities in the field of chemistry, and to determine whether graduate school was a good next step in their academic career. Participants each year indicated a greater need for communication from the project, which can be addressed in future iterations of the REU at Clemson. Overall, the REU program reached its goals and provided students with the skills, knowledge, and motivation to pursue degrees in chemistry or chemistry-related fields. A common theme across all three years of the IMPRESS REU was that the project helped students decide on their future plans. For some, the REU helped them decide to attend graduate school. For others, the project helped them decide they do not want to pursue a career or degree in chemistry. Still, others decided they want to pursue a chemistry career but were not yet ready for graduate school. All were valuable outcomes for the REU project.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Project outcomes</strong>: The project led to the publication of 12 peer-reviewed articles, including REU participants as co-authors.
