 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses range limitations associated with next-generation high-frequency communication systems, a pain point shared by commercial and defense sectors. Millimeter-wave defense radar systems provide more accurate mapping of a landscape or objects, but have reduced range capabilities compared to standard radar systems. This reduced range also affects the telecommunication industry and motivates building more base stations to provide high-frequency 5G coverage over large areas. By increasing range via an aluminum nitride-enhanced power amplifier, this project aims to increase the object detection limit of defense radar systems and maximum base station coverage by up to 40%. This will enable more improved performance for defense application and also reduce the number of base stations necessary for future (6G and beyond) telecommunication networks.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to scale aluminum nitride as a new material platform for high-power, high-frequency power amplifiers. Current power amplifier materials, typically silicon and gallium nitride, are often constrained by heat and voltage limitations. By incorporating aluminum nitride, this project can potentially improve power amplifier power density by two-fold, and provides 25% lower temperature operation at the same power level as conventional power amplifiers. Towards these goals, this STTR project will scale up the aluminum nitride platform and target commercially relevant discrete transistor yields.  The targeted minimum viable product is an aluminum nitride platform microwave monolithically integrated circuit.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
