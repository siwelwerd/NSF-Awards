 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project entails the reduction of US energy demand via accelerated adoption of wireless smart glass technologies in buildings. Smart window technologies could save 2.19 gigatons of carbon by 2050, resulting in $321.5 B in energy savings. The proposed project will advance a transparent power source for wireless operation of smart windows and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The envisioned system will be stable, efficient, and scalable, and will meet window aesthetic requirements. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will explore a photovoltaic technology that selectively absorbs near-ultraviolet (NUV) light - energy that is otherwise wasted - and efficiently converts it into high-voltage power. Solar cells harvesting NUV photons could satisfy the unmet need of powering smart windows over the same spatial footprint without competing for visible or infrared photons that the windows seek to regulate.  Scientific broader impacts from this project include contributions to the understanding of structure-property relationships governing organic photovoltaic (OPV) active layer composition and resulting visible light transmittance.  Phase II technical deliverables will include demonstration of a NUV solar module with world-leading visible transparency.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
