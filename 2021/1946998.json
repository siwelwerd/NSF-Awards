 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-energy X-rays are an indispensable tool for research into materials, molecules, organisms, and devices. They resolve physical, chemical, and structural properties across a wide range of length- and time-scales. X-rays probe directly the very important degrees of freedom of electrons in a material. High magnetic fields are broadly used across science and industry. They resolve the electronic properties of quantum materials, induce new phases of matter, and enable nuclear magnetic resonance. They are critical for medical imaging and particle acceleration. Applied magnetic fields couple directly to the same electronic degrees of freedom that are probed by X-rays. Rich science opportunities exist for researchers to manipulate electrons using magnetic fields and monitor their response using X-rays. This award supports the realization of a mid-scale infrastructure project that exploits cutting edge synchrotron X-ray tools to enable new science at the high magnetic field frontier by building a dedicated High Magnetic Field (HMF) X-ray facility at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). This proposal is a partnership between CHESS, the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (MagLab), and the University of Puerto Rico (UPR). The proposed research infrastructure will serve convergence research between the large, multidisciplinary user communities of two forefront National Science Foundation (NSF) funded facilities \u2013 CHESS and the MagLab. The project will engage early career researchers from underrepresented groups in design and implementation of cutting-edge X-ray and magnet technology, with particular focus on training students from UPR to become future technology leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe High Magnetic Field Beamline (HMF) at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) realized by this project, will combine the best possible X-ray beamline with the highest possible DC magnetic fields, drawing on the talents of leading experts in the distinct disciplines of X-ray science and high magnetic field science to deliver research capabilities that are unique in the world. \r\nThe X-ray beamline design is based on 3 priorities: delivering high photon flux, allowing precise control of X-ray polarization and beam size over a wide range of X-ray energies, and exploiting sophisticated analyzer and detector systems to enable multimodal X-ray measurements. Evaluated solely on the characteristics of the X-ray beams and detection, HMF will rival the capabilities of any magnetic scattering or spectroscopy beamline in the world. HMF will feature a custom low-temperature superconducting magnet generating continuous fields as high as 20 Tesla. The beamline will be designed to accommodate even higher field magnets in the future which will become feasible through the development of high temperature superconducting magnet technology at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (MagLab). With this combination of high DC magnetic fields available at a highly optimized X-ray beamline, the facility becomes truly world-leading. This project embraces goals of student training, increased participation of underrepresented groups, and extension of tangible benefits to the wider US research community. This award will integrate graduate students from the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) at Rio Piedras into the development, construction, and commissioning of the new beamline.\r\nA main science driver for the HMF facility is quantum materials science, with significant broader societal impacts: The \"quantum leap that promises to develop radical new sensing, computing, and communications technologies. Another key to enable the \"quantum leap\" is to train a new quantum workforce for the nation. Seizing international leadership in high magnetic field x-ray science, this project will help ensure that top talent is trained and retained in the US.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
