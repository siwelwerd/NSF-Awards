 "awd_abstract_narration": "A complex network of stakeholders, resources, activities, and information move food from farm to plate through a soil to soil food system (FS). To ensure the health of this system, especially through times of crisis and instability, all of the system's stakeholders (e.g., residents, food-producers, researchers, and policy-makers) need fresh, up-to-date information, something only possible at scale through the aid of community members. This project lays the foundations for a sustainable, community-driven data collection tool that will simultaneously help community members to better understand their food system by answering questions like \"Where can I find healthy, fresh, low-cost food?\" while encouraging participation in the food system by helping to keep data fresh and up-to-date. This planning proposal will develop a proof-of-concept, using image recognition (e.g., at retail stores or farm stands) to streamline the process of recording information about the availability, price, types, and other characteristics of produce available at produce displays. The project will also work with community members to drive adoption of the tool through healthy eating workshops and data-collection competitions. \r\n\r\nWorking collaboratively with non-profit and local government community partners in the Western New York (WNY) food system, the project team of researchers and stakeholder will develop data collection platform called REAP (Research, Education, Action, And Policy for Resilience) to allow crowdsourced data to augment an existing WNY food system dashboard. For example, by allowing for crowdsourced produce price data, the team can analyze how this information impacts the behaviors of both consumers and suppliers in the food system. The project will advance the state of the art in computer vision and uncertain data management by developing techniques to correlate multiple sources of information in images while ignoring distractors, and for tracking the system's confidence in the resulting information through the entire data presentation pipeline. The proposed work also includes a meta-analysis, using pre- and post- surveys, as well as graph analysis on the data captured through REAP, to examine how the availability and flow of co-produced information and food-related behavioral actions affect food system stakeholders. REAP lays the groundwork for ongoing efforts to map the WNY food system, simultaneously studying both urban and rural participants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

For example, the app makes it easier to locate alternative produce options that vary in availability and location, options like community gardens, farm trucks, or pop-up food stands. Such a resource could have been incredibly helpful in the wake of the horrific May 2022 Tops shooting in Buffalo's East Side Neighborhood; In addition to the immediate impacts of the tragedy, the closure of the store left approximately 1/3 of the neighborhood's residents without a food source within walking distance. Pop-up food stands were quickly arranged by the community to fill this need, but coordinating and communicating their locations was an ongoing challenge during the crisis period.\n\n\n\n\nCommunity engagement was a critical objective throughout the proposal: Team members established relationships with organizations including Urban Fruits and Veggies, and the African Heritage Co-op. Most notably, this award allowed us to participate in and contribute to the Food Future WNY project, which is an ongoing effort to map Western New York's Food System. Among other accomplishments, at the Food Future WNY report launch, we presented the results of a study to better understand the social networks of the WNY Food System's stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\nLast, but not least, was an effort to understand the food system as a cycle; By predicting food waste, we can better understand the factors that lead to food waste and begin to propose strategies for mitigating it. We used daily records of food waste, customer counts, and sales volume, for a Florida-based restaurant to develop such a model, identifying predictive analytics as a useful framework for estimating daily food waste. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/12/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: OliverAKennedy\n"
