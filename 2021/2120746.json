 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the Engineering for US All (e4usa): A National Pilot Program for High School Engineering Course and Database project is to demystify and democratize engineering through a program targeting high school students and teachers that will by nature benefit society and advance the desire for an enhanced future engineering workforce. The program expands the pool of teachers capable of teaching engineering and the number of students considering further education and/or a career in engineering. The knowledge taught by empowered teachers will provide a broader understanding of engineering intended to excite an interest in pursuing additional engineering education. Specific efforts to collaborate with a diverse group of schools (urban, suburban, rural, private, public, parochial, single gender, etc.) will ensure that this program reaches as many Americans as possible especially those who have previously been unable to offer engineering. Partnerships with post-secondary institutions will also create and facilitate pathways for students to explore possible engineering careers. Scaling and sustaining e4usa will allow the project to address the desired outcome of a more educated citizenry and increased numbers of students joining the future engineering workforce. Continued support for e4usa will establish the program as major contributor in the field of engineering and technological literacy, while bringing engineering truly to all.\r\n\r\nEngineering for US All (e4usa): A National Pilot Program for High School Engineering Course and Database\u2019s primary goal is to demystify and democratize the learning and practice of engineering by engaging high school students and teachers in a project-based engineering curriculum. e4usa will increase engineering literacy for all and expand opportunities for all Americans to pursue careers as engineers. Current NSF funding has led to the creation of the e4usa curriculum, teacher professional learning (e.g., professional development workshops and community of practice), and additional supporting resources (e.g., MyDesign\u00ae). This first of its kind program presents the engineering field using four big ideas: 1) discover engineering, 2) engineering in society, 3) engineering professional skills, and 4) engineering design. This Design and Development grant is intended to support efforts to scale, study, and sustain e4usa over the next three years. School settings will be broadened by expanding the reach of e4usa to 50 teachers and approximately 5,000 students nationwide. Design-Based Implementation Research (DBIR) capturing participating student and teacher data will continue and expand to include five in-depth case studies.  Knowledge gained will inform central components of e4usa intended to improve developed resources, expand partnerships, garner insights into the impacts of e4usa, and increase pathways for credit and placement These insights, in conjunction with the creation of an oversight and advocacy agency, will provide the foundation for e4usa becoming a self-sustaining, independent entity supported by key partners like TeachEngineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
