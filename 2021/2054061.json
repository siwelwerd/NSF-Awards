 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Multispecies Ovary Tissue Histology Electronic Repository will provide public access to digitized microscopic images of ovary tissues along with information that ensures image integrity and quality.  Currently, there is no electronic repository of ovary histology slides that preserves these valuable research collections for future generations.  This repository will provide a web-accessible, open resource for scientists, educators, and the public to stimulate collaboration and scientific research.  Educators may use the slide images in a range of courses from reproductive biology to teaching computerized image analysis.\r\n\r\nReproduction is vital for sustaining all living organisms, and multiple strategies exist among different species.  The long-term goals for this project are to increase reproductive science capacity and infrastructure; and to serve as a resource for educators. The tool builds upon existing openly available resources, e.g., the Open Science Framework, to foster data sharing and collaboration.  Metadata about each image ensures image quality and provides additional details about the animal and experimental design.  An initial set of species (i.e., hundreds of vertebrate species including non-human primates, other mammals, fishes, and amphibians) will be included with a long-term goal that scientists will contribute data from additional species.  Value-added data segmentation results will be made available along with the procedures used to generate the results.  Upon completion, The respository will facilitate comparative studies of ovarian development and folliculogenesis to better understand: reproductive strategies across species and inspire new ideas for ensuring the survival of threatened and endangered species; the similarities and differences between vertebrate species at the organ, tissue and cellular level; and mechanisms that can be encoded in predictive mathematical/computational models that can extract additional value from the existing data and may lead to the reduced use of experimental animals.  Biology is increasingly dependent upon quantitative data analysis, and this project should inspire computational thinking in biology broadly, while developing specific skills in microscopy, computer programming, and data and image analysis.  Research results may be obtained at: mother-db.org.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

MOTHER provides a service to scientists for disseminating images of valuable histology slides that may otherwise end up in a box on a lab shelf or discarded when a scientist retires.&nbsp; For educators at all levels, ovary images can be used in a variety of classes, e.g., biology, anatomy, histology, reproductive science, toxicology, and data science. For researchers interested in female reproduction in a range of species, MOTHER provides a repository of invaluable data for studying individual species and for doing cross-species studies and comparisons. Additionally, comparative analyses across species and the analysis of morphological or structural changes with age may lead to new discoveries for reproductive longevity and/or control. The identification of the structural features of an ovary is an important, yet time consuming task, for ovarian research. MOTHER's large collection of images for a wide variety of animals may assist research to train computer algorithms, known as machine learning, to automate the identification of these features for use in reproduction research.</p>\r\n<p>In February 2025, MOTHER contained 480 ovary histology images from 16 species&nbsp;contributed by seven scientists. There are many histology images, from various species and different scientists, in the submission pipeline that will be available in MOTHER soon. The MOTHER Web portal (https://mother-db.org) is a gateway for searching and sharing histology images, as well as accessible background information on the nonhuman primate ovary and reproductive science, videos, publications, presentations and other resources.&nbsp; A scientist shares an image using ezEML+MOTHER (Figs. 2 &amp; 3), a Web-based tool developed by our team for the collection of metadata (information about the ovary histology images) that complies with FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) principles for sharing digital assets.&nbsp; In addition to the MOTHER Web portal, there are three publicly accessible, Web-based resources used for storing and disseminating information: (i) an Open Science Framework project (<a href=\"https://osf.io/w8d65/\">https://osf.io/w8d65/</a>) contains instructional videos on female reproductive science and ovary follicle identification by Dr. Zelinski; (ii) a GitHub repository (<a href=\"https://github.com/mother-db\">https://github.com/mother-db</a>) stores computer code and tools; and (iii) Zenodo provides persistent Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and usage tracking (<a href=\"https://zenodo.org/communities/motherdb_org/records\">https://zenodo.org/communities/motherdb_org/records</a>) of project protocols and educational outreach material. Each resource provides a unique function and allows additional methods of discovery for the MOTHER project.</p>\r\n<p>During the project period, MOTHER provided research experiences for 38 undergraduates and five graduate students, and was used as the basis for class projects in a biological data science course. Research students came from a broad range of educational disciplines (e.g., biology, pharmacology and toxicology, medical studies, environmental science, applied computing, applied math), and backgrounds (e.g., socioeconomic status, first in their family to attend college). The students assisted with one or more areas of MOTHER development including designing the database, implementing the ezEML+MOTHER metadata collection tool, writing scripts for transferring and curating the images and their metadata, scanning collaborators' ovary histology slides using light microscopy, creating ezEML+MOTHER metadata files for scanned images, identifying structural features of an ovary, such as follicles, annotating images used as training data by machine learning algorithms (nearly 8000 follicles were classified), and developing machine learning algorithms to automatically identify macaque ovarian follicles in different stages of development. To improve their scientific communication skills, students contributed to written project protocols and created educational material. These resources are available through the MOTHER Web portal.&nbsp; Presentations and publications are listed in the Dissemination page of the MOTHER Web portal along with selected posters. The MOTHER project created new cyberinfrastructure for scientists, educators and the public while providing a significant number of research experiences and professional development opportunities for students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fig. 1 References</strong></p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p class=\"reference\">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Young, K., 2024. <em>Young Lab: American Crow CSULB 2 Ovary Slide 1 #5 JC73 03/13/04</em>.
