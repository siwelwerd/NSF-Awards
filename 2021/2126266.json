 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project makes the Internet \"smarter\".  The \"end to end\" principle of Internet design states that the routers, switches, WiFi base stations, etc. that comprise the network should only forward packets. There are many instances in which small amounts of processing at intermediate stages can make Internet applications more efficient. Cloud computing services have had a significant impact on society. Many envision an even more powerful Internet with cloud-like services distributed throughout and all the way to the edge of the network. This project is exploring a smart network with small servers embedded in the fabric of the Internet.\r\n\r\nThis project brings together a novel lightweight execution model suitable for efficient in-network microservices, and a topology aware coordination and control layer, with a policy language to express desired application services and requirements. The execution model, called InLocus, is designed to bridge the gap between network packet processors and stateful network services. InLocus runs on conventional microprocessors and microcontrollers, as well as on accelerators like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). This enables necessary functionality with minimal resources. The coordination framework monitors the network (with extensions to the PerfSONAR network monitoring system) and can make intelligent service placement and instantiation decisions. This project will integrate and evaluate two important application environments, one in Earth Sciences and one applicable to distributed machine learning. Each of these will work in conjunction with NSF cyberinfrastructure resources.\r\n\r\nThis project stands to impact scientific and commercial applications and their users. Just as the Internet has touched many lives in the past years, a better Internet will continue to drive innovation and users' qualities of experience. Techniques like the ones we are exploring are widely regarded as necessary to fully realize autonomous vehicles and smart cities, as well as user-oriented capabilities like augmented reality. Additionally, we teach many of the tenets of this project in classes and seminars at various levels, as they embody the history and the future of the Internet.\r\n\r\nThis project's web site is at http://indiana.open.luddy.indiana.edu/ and a project overview, component descriptions, and links to source code repositories can be found there. This project builds, and integrates, previously funded projects. These previous projects remained open source even after their period of funding ended. Further, the core functionality has been maintained as other work depends on it. This project's data and code will be maintained as long as possible.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
