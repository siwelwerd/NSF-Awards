 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable novel binary code AI applications for cybersecurity, by providing a fast and accurate method to reverse-engineer executable code. Current solutions are slow and inaccurate, and the volume of code analyzed by cybersecurity applications is huge.  Cybersecurity companies either deploy tremendous computing resources to handle huge volumes of code or only extract superficial features from code for AI models, making those solutions extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks.  The proposed solution will not only save computing resources but will allow for improved solutions by extracting complex features from executable code and applying more advanced AI models.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project provides an innovative disassembly solution for binary code. The lack of a fast and accurate disassembler has become an obstacle to the applications of novel AI approaches in the cybersecurity industry. The proposed solution combines state-of-the-art binary analysis techniques and newly emerging deep learning techniques to build a fast and accurate disassembler.  The proposed solution utilizes GPU technology to accelerate the disassembly process.  The final disassembly is expected to be over 100 times faster than state-of-the-art disassemblers, while achieving the same or better accuracy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n  \n\n \nSummary\n\n \nInspired by the successes of AI applications (e.g., text/image/voice recognition), the cybersecurity industry is exploring AI solutions to overcome cybersecurity challenges (e.g., malware detection, vulnerability scanning, etc.). Compared with text, image and voice processing, there is an inherent challenge in processing binary code (i.e., machine code). In order to make sense of binary code, it must be disassembled so we can recover the semantic meanings of instructions. If we directly feed raw binary code to AI models, only superficial features can be picked up by AI models. The resulting AI solutions will be extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Unfortunately, the existing disassemblers are slow and inaccurate, especially when dealing with obfuscated code.  Thus, the lack of a fast and accurate disassembler has become an obstacle to the applications of novel AI approaches in the cybersecurity industry. \n\n \nWe leverage the recent advance in deep learning to develop a disassembler with high accuracy and efficiency.  Our experimental results have shown that our disassembler is 100 times faster than state-fo-art disassemblers.   On top of this disassembler, we also developed two new AI-based binary code analysis capabilities - malware analysis and software bill of materials (SBOM)  analysis.  To overcome the challenges mentioned in the executive order 14028 on improving the Nation?s cybersecurity,  we further combined the disassembler together with the new analysis capabilities  to enable visibility for software supply chain security. It is an AI-powered platform that generates SBOM directly from binary code and continuously protects software build, acquisition, and operation. \n\n \nIntellectual Merit\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to enable binary code AI via novel disassembly. The Phase I findings demonstrated the high performance of disassembly using latest deep learning techniques. It also explored applications of this technology on malware analysis and software bill of materials analysis. By combining these innovations together, Deepbits is building a competitive solution on protecting software build, acquisition, and operation.\n\n\n\n\nBroader Impacts\nThe broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to inspire cybersecurity industry to develop more innovative AI-based cybersecurity solutions using Deepbits? disassembly solution.  Deepbits has built a suite of disassembly tools and binary code analysis tools for other vendor to explore AI for cybersecurity.   It helps build more secure software in a more efficient approach, and eventually, reduces the lost caused by cyber incidents, and the expenditure of R&amp;D.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/17/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Xunchao Hu"
