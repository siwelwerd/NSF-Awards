 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The University of Wisconsin-River Falls is acquiring a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with low-vacuum capability, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, as well as secondary electron, backscattered electron, and cathodoluminescence detectors to support the research of Samuel Alvarado and colleagues Lowell McCann, Timothy Lyden and Kevin Thaisen. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of chemistry, biotechnology, biology, plant and earth science, and physics. In general, scanning electron microscopy is used to image and understand chemical phenomena at the nano and mesoscales. This microscope uses a focused electron beam, which is scanned over a surface to generate an image and subsequently produces signals that reveal information about the composition and topology of a sample. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels. \r\n\r\nThis award of a scanning electron microscope for high resolution imaging and analysis capabilities is aimed at enhancing research and education, especially in the areas of chemical, biological, and physical sciences. Research in chemistry focuses on characterizing polymer quantum dot composite materials for fabricating and testing photovoltaic and luminescent devices with electron-beam lithography and investigating crystalline byproducts from ball milling organic reactions. Examination of micrometeorites collected in urban settings are also performed. Biological systems will also be under study, particularly in the area of skeletal muscle and stromal cell development to better understand healthy cell and dysfunctional cell biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
