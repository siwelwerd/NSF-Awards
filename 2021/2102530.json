 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will combine geoscience methods to characterize the movement of the landscape associated with the magnitude 5.1 earthquake that shook the town of Sparta in North Carolina on August 9, 2020. These methods will include flying across the area undertaking a high-resolution laser imaging detection and ranging system (LiDAR) to obtain a post-earthquake landscape survey with high vertical accuracy. Surface geology and geophysical observations will be integrated with LiDAR, allowing the precise location and measurement of effects caused at or near the surface by the earthquake. The information gained from this project will be crucial for earthquake hazard analysis and may be applied to reduce failure of building infrastructure and lifelines and loss of life in future earthquakes. Outreach activities with the local communities will be undertaken to broaden understanding of geoscience and specifically earthquakes. The Principal investigators and co-investigators will collaborate with the U.S. Geological Survey and the North Carolina Geological Survey to integrate the results of this study with their efforts. The project is led by a female early career scientist, and diverse graduate students (female, Latinx and African-Caribbean) will gain broad knowledge and experience from working on this project. \r\n\r\nThe Mw 5.1 08/09/2020 earthquake, near Sparta, North Carolina was strongly felt in the town of Sparta (Intensity VI) and across the Southeastern, Midwest, and Northeastern USA, with MMI\u2013II recorded as far away as Wilmington (NC), Atlanta (GA), Cincinnati (OH) and Washington DC. This uncommon moderate earthquake caused a displacement (rupture) of the ground surface, being the first time that a surface rupture was recognized in the eastern USA, after European occupation. Moreover, it is extremely rare for M5 earthquakes to rupture the surface. Efforts to document its characteristics were undertaken on August 9 and the weeks following. Preliminary observations suggest that the surface deformation may be associated to re-activation of sub-surface pre-existent discontinuities, whose tectonic activity is poorly understood. The surface fault is expressed by a narrow zone of deformation, traceable for approximately 2.2 kilometers along strike. Along the length of the surface rupture, the deformation is accommodated by reverse displacement and/or folding/flexure generating a scarp with a maximum vertical displacement of approximately 20 centimeters and average of 8\u201310 centimeters. This project will complete the characterization of the surface rupture on its entire length. The propject will acquire a high-resolution LiDAR data, and will continue the ongoing acquisition of terrestrial LiDAR scan survey data, high resolution aerial imagery, and subsurface geophysical survey data. Additional geologic and geomorphic observations will be collected, namely through geological excavations that will target areas with potential record for paleoseismicity. This cross-correlation of data will help answer fundamental questions on the Sparta earthquake dynamics. This project will make a strong contribution to the knowledge about seismic risk associated to moderate seismicity in the Eastern United States and very likely for similar intraplate settings. This research will provide the opportunity of understanding how deformation in the surface was accommodated, how the surface rupture occurred and what pre-existing structures near the surface are capable to propagate seismicity. For that, the combination of remote data and field observations which will include sub-surface surveys will be essential. Several studies of seismicity Mw\u22656.0 correlating geological deformation, sub-surface structures, paleoseismology, seismology and remote sensing have been undertaken in other regions of the world; however not for a Mw 5.1 and as such this helps make this study unique.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our research focused on the recognition and characterization of the co-seismic surface deformation and the characterization of the active fault that produced the earthquake.</p>\n<p>The M<sub>w</sub> 5.1 Sparta earthquake, in North Carolina was a moderate magnitude event that caused a co-seismic surface rupture (displacement of the ground surface), the first faulting surface rupture recognized in the Eastern US since the arrival of Europeans. The hypocenter was a shallow one at a depth of ~2 km and the focal mechanism shows an oblique motion, composed of a mostly reverse motion with a minor left-lateral component. It was generated on a previously unknown WNW-trending fault (now named the Little River fault), oblique to the NE-trending regional structural grain, and localized outside the regional seismic zones. It produced displacement of the ground surface by a reverse fault causing an uplift of the southern block (hanging wall) and forming a co-seismic scarp (topographic step) which was initially recognized along ~2 km with a N110-120&deg; trend.</p>\n<p>Several geoscience methods were combined in this project: topographic surface analysis using remote sensing (High-Resolution Topography, UAV imagery, InSAR), geophysical sub-surface surveys (Ground Penetration Radar and Electrical Resistivity Tomography), and geological surveys at the surface and through paleoseismologic excavations across the fault zone. The high-resolution lidar acquired by NCALM was the first post-earthquake lidar covering the co-seismic region in Sparta including forest areas. The lidar data has a QL0 quality and a vertical resolution of &lt; 5&ndash;10 cm along the co-seismic surface rupture. The analysis of the data allowed for further identification of subtle co-seismic deformation features, not previously recognized, enlarging the width of the deformation zone identified immediately after the earthquake. A vertical differencing analysis highlighted the vertical surface displacement and extended the length of the surface rupture to ~ 4 km.We also conducted a 3D topographic differencing analysis, which corroborated a left lateral component interpreted as associated with a deeper rupture, and likely occurred in a different fault branch than the one that reached the surface. The geophysics surveys were acquired along the central surface rupture, covering two areas of 60 x 20m, and their cross-correlation analysis showed a sub-surface ~15 m wide fault zone, placed in the footwall immediately next to the surface rupture with linear features (reflectors in the GPR) dipping with a low angle to the southwest, which was interpreted to correspond to the reverse fault plane(s) active during the 2020 earthquake. Geological and geomorphologic mapping was conducted across the rupture zone, corroborating the existence of a brittle deformation zone, and its reactivation during the 2020 earthquake. The combination of geophysical, geological, and geomorphologic data led to the selection of sites for paleoseismology studies. We excavated two paleoseismologic trenches (~30m long x 2 m deep) across the co-seismic surface rupture, being the first detailed paleoseismology trenches with recognition of paleo surface ruptures in North Carolina. The trenches exposed the weathered metamorphic bedrock of the Ashe Metamorphic Suite, underlying a sequence of Quaternary soil and colluvium. Several WNW-NW fault strands deform the bedrock and the upper Quaternary sequence in a complex, 15-m-wide fault zone.</p>\n<p>We described and logged in detail the geology, soil development, and fault zone, and photogrammetric trench wall images were produced. We used the soil horizons as markers for displacements. Luminescence samples were collected and processed in the Geochronology Laboratories at North Carolina State University. From the WNW-NW fault strands, we identified three strands that accommodated the reverse motion during the 2020 rupture, with a cumulative along-fault dip-slip displacement of 50 cm and producing a ~30 cm vertical step (scarp) in the surface topography. In both trenches, there is evidence for two paleo surface ruptures (pre-2020), interpreted by differential cumulative displacements of the different soil horizons with late Pleistocene preliminary ages.</p>\n<p>Major outcomes of this study are 1) the identification of recurrent surface rupture events during the late Quaternary in the Sparta region and 2) the recognition of permanent surface deformation (reverse and strike-slip motion) in a wider area than along the surface rupture, an observation supported by high-resolution topography (lidar). These observations are the first of this type for the eastern US and support that even moderate-magnitude events are capable of causing permanent deformation, and impact infrastructures. This study adds to our understanding of regional tectonics, which despite being a low tectonic setting is capable of reactivating older structures during the Quaternary.</p>\n<p>Results from this study were presented at national and international conferences and outreach activities were done for local authorities and communities that were eager to learn about the earthquake and local seismic hazard. The education goals of the project included training of undergraduate and graduate students and professional development for researchers in paleoseismology and active tectonics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/20/2024<br>\nModified by: Paula&nbsp;Marques Figueiredo</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2102530/2102530_10708277_1708465804518_Perspective_T3_for_NSF--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2102530/2102530_10708277_1708465804518_Perspective_T3_for_NSF--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Trench wall showing the fault zone\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2102530/2102530_10708277_1708465804518_Perspective_T3_for_NSF--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Trench wall showing the fault zone\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A photogrammetric image of the eastern trench wall for T3, showing a 12-15 m wide fault zone, and deformation in the weathered bedrock and overlaying Quaternary sequence.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Paula Figueiredo</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Paula&nbsp;Marques Figueiredo\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Trench wall showing the fault zone</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2102530/2102530_10708277_1708464430761_vertical_differencing_for_site--rgov-214x142.PNG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2102530/2102530_10708277_1708464430761_vertical_differencing_for_site--rgov-800width.PNG\" title=\"Lidar analysis\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2102530/2102530_10708277_1708464430761_vertical_differencing_for_site--rgov-66x44.PNG\" alt=\"Lidar analysis\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The vertical differencing between the post-earthquake lidar (November 2020) acquired by NCALM for this project and a pre-earthquake lidar (2016, 3DEP) highlighted the uplifted southern block (hanging wall) and the trace of the surface rupture.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Paula Figueiredo</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Paula&nbsp;Marques Figueiredo\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Lidar analysis</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2102530/2102530_10708277_1708464178936_Geophysics_for_site--rgov-214x142.PNG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2102530/2102530_10708277_1708464178936_Geophysics_for_site--rgov-800width.PNG\" title=\"Geophysics Survey- an example\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2102530/2102530_10708277_1708464178936_Geophysics_for_site--rgov-66x44.PNG\" alt=\"Geophysics Survey- an example\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The upper image shows Electrical Resistivity Tomography (dipole-dipole), red arrow indicates the surface rupture, coinciding with a lower resistivity zone interpreted as the fault zone: lower images show Ground Penetration Radar and red arrows show reflectors interpreted as S-dipping fault planes.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">DelWayne Bohnenstiehl and Paula Figueiredo</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Paula&nbsp;Marques Figueiredo\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Geophysics Survey- an example</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2102530/2102530_10708277_1708465588707_IncisionFigureslopefor_site--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2102530/2102530_10708277_1708465588707_IncisionFigureslopefor_site--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Detail of the surface rupture in lidar\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2102530/2102530_10708277_1708465588707_IncisionFigureslopefor_site--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Detail of the surface rupture in lidar\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Aspect-slope model for the central section of the surface rupture (angle of view north to south).
