 "awd_abstract_narration": "Network data is ubiquitous in the real-world, and many online websites providing various kinds services can all be represented as networks, e.g., online social networks, e-commerce networks, and academic networks. Learning and mining of network structured data have been one of the most popular yet challenging research problems studied in recent years. This project will study the problem of how to find a simple, yet effective representation for each network node, which can capture its characteristics or role in the network based on its connections. This is referred to as the network embedding problem. As an effective tool to transform network data into classic feature-vector representations, network embedding aims at mapping the network data into a low-dimensional feature space, i.e., with a small number of features for each network node. With the embedding results, all these aforementioned networks will be benefited to improve their services provided for the public. This project focuses on developing a general network embedding framework, and investigating its extension to application-oriented, multi-network and dynamic-network scenarios. This project will help support female and minority students to participate in academic research about network embedding. \r\n\r\nNetwork embedding studied in this project is a challenging learning task due to many reasons. (1) Data perspective, the heterogeneity of real-world social network data renders existing homogeneous-network oriented embedding models failing to work; (2) Structure preserving perspective, many first-order proximity based embedding methods can hardly preserve the complex social network structure with heterogeneous node types; and (3) Task perspective, the detachment of embedding process with external tasks makes the learnt results ineffective for application tasks with specific objectives. This project aims at tackling these challenges by proposing a novel extensible heterogeneous social network embedding model, which can effectively incorporate the objectives of external tasks in the learning process. This project covers five main themes: (1) extensible heterogeneous network embedding foundation; (2) application oriented embedding of single heterogeneous network; (3) embedding over multiple heterogeneous network for network alignment; (4) dynamic heterogeneous network embedding for friend recommendation; and (5) advanced scalable heterogeneous network embedding technique exploration. This project will greatly enrich the fundamental principles and technologies of social network mining and data mining. In terms of the broader impact, advances in network embedding analysis have transformative potential for fundamental advances in understanding the behavior and activities of the social networks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Research Discoveries:</strong>&nbsp;With the support of this project, significant advancements were made in the study of heterogeneous information embedding and graph neural network (GNN) research. The research introduced several innovative GNN models (i.e., Theme 1), including IsoNN, Graph-Bert, and the Mixed-Curvature Graph Neural Network, which were designed to address diverse learning scenarios. These models were applied across various domains&nbsp;(i.e., Theme 2) such as fraud detection, recommender systems, social networks, document graphs, and healthcare.

For dynamic graph-structured data&nbsp;(i.e., Theme 4), a transformer-based module was developed to model node representations based on their local neighborhoods and sequential timestamps, capturing the temporal progression of graph data. To handle large-scale graph datasets&nbsp;(i.e., Theme 5), the research introduced techniques such as sub-graph sampling and adaptive momentum-based training, enabling efficient and effective training of deep GNNs.

With the support by this grant, one textbook, entitled \"<em>Broad Learning Through Fusions\"</em>, was finished and published by Springer in 2019, which covers many of research discoveries mentioned above on heterogeneous information embedding tasks across aligned social networks. Additionally, the project generated over 60 scholarly articles in leading conferences and journals, including SIGIR, WWW, CIKM, KDD, ICDM, ICDE, NeurIPS, EMNLP, and ACL. This body of work has had a substantial impact on the research community and has influenced the direction of heterogeneous information network studies. Several publications received special recognition, including \"Best Student Paper Runner-Up Awards\" at ICDM' 2020 and SIGIR' 2023, which acknowledged the project innovative contributions to sub-graph contrastive learning and graph collaborative signal denoising in recommender systems.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Education and Training:</strong>&nbsp;In terms of educational contributions, the project supported the development of new courses at the University of California, Davis. These included ECS 189G (Deep Learning) for undergraduate students and ECS 289G (Advanced Deep Learning) for graduate students. Both courses were well-received, with average student evaluations of 4.5 out of 5. Over the course of the project, three Ph.D. students, five master students, and several undergraduate students completed their studies under the guidance of the PI. Among them, Dr. Haopeng Zhang, a Ph.D. graduate, secured a faculty position at the University of Hawaii and continues to pursue research in network embedding and graph modeling. The project also provided academic and professional training for a diverse group of students, including three female Ph.D. graduates and many students from underrepresented groups, demonstrating its commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion in academia.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Professional Outreach and Impacts:</strong>&nbsp;The project also achieved significant outreach and community engagement. Research findings were presented at major academic conferences through oral presentations, workshops, and tutorials. The PI organized workshops on heterogeneous information network analysis, including the third and fourth Heterogeneous Information Network Analysis and Applications (HENA) workshops at CIKM' 2019 and KDD' 2021, respectively. Additionally, the PI and supported students actively participated in prominent conferences such as KDD, ICDE, CIKM, The Web Conference, EMNLP, and NAACL, sharing findings and engaging with the broader research community.
