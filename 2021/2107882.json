 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor R. Kenneth Marcus and his group at Clemson University are working to prepare, characterize, and implement a unique format of fiber capillary-channeled polymers (C-CP) to facilitate the isolation, purification and quantification of biological and synthetic nanoparticles. Target systems include exosomes, a class of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are integral components in intracellular communication, and thus are involved in normal homeostatic function, but also in the the evolution of abnormal biological function; thus there are long term implications of the studies being performed herein for biomedical science.  The applications under study employ a hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) protocol on polyester C-CP fiber columns, a system designed to probe  aspects of fundamental biochemistry. The overall goal of the studies is to produce efficient, selective, and economical separations. This work is interdisciplinary, involving collaborative efforts among research groups in chemistry, bioengineering, mathematical, and materials sciences. If successful, the project may result in new commercial ventures in the textile and biopharmaceutical industries in South Carolina. Efforts related to developing a diverse workforce include integration of research topics into relevant coursework.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of separation/purification strategies for biological and synthetic nanoparticles involve physical means such as ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration, and size-exclusion methods. Use of C-CP fibers to affect these separations rests on the ability to differentiate nanoparticles based upon chemical functionality, whose interaction strengths are determined in part based on particle size. The C-CP fiber platform can be implemented across a number of formats including spin-down micropipette tips and microbore columns.  As a result, relevant problems in fundamental biochemistry, clinical analysis, and process analytical chemistry can be addressed. In-line particle sizing via multi-angle light scattering (MALS) provides both qualitative and quantitative information about eluted nanoparticles/vesicles.  Surface modifications employing immobilized ligands can target selective capture of nanoparticles, complemented by selective immunolabelling strategies for species-specific assays. Multidimensional separations offer another innovative aspect for efficient characterization of nanoparticles from complex systems. In all cases, performance metrics will be compared to those available from commercial columns and standard methods. Development of practical methods will be augmented with fundamental studies directed at understanding physico-chemical processes at the microscopic level.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

At the heart of most of these separations is the use of the technique of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The Marcus group at Clemson University has developed a family of polymer fiber materials which are effective at the rapid, high efficiency separation of what might be best termed large bodies; with proteins of \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDuring the course of this funded project, Marcus and co-workers have applied the C-CP fiber platform towards separations of relevance more specifically to the biopharmaceutical industry. In this regard, the most common target species are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) produced in bioreactor cultures of mammalian cells. While antibody treatments of diverse diseases have become common over decades, challenges still exist towards improving the purities, throughput, and overhead costs. Emerging forms of therapeutics lie in the areas of cell and gene therapies. The latter case involves the delivery of proteinaceous or genetic materials to targets cells and organs by encapsulating the therapeutic entity within a three-dimensional carrier body, termed a vector. Among the vector species under development for gene therapies, the most common are adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), lentiviruses, and extracellular vesicles (EVs). Just as there are complementary and contradictory aspects to the biochemical approaches and relevant therapeutic species regarding molecular (antibody) and vector-based modalities, the methods of purification are often quite divergent. The methods developed in the Clemson University laboratories look to employ a single platform employed in both regimes.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe C-CP fibers have found application in the various stages of the separation/ purification processes of proteins in general, and antibodies in particular, enhancing the overall throughput and information content. In this regard fiber-based columns have been employed to selectively isolate the target mAbs from the raw cell cultures, with the added feature of requiring not prior form of filtering; a process which adds complexity and loss of valuable product. The fibers were also employed in-line as an effective means of modifying the chemical (liquid phase) environment of isolated antibodies to allow more efficient coupling of orthogonal separation stages. Finally, and perhaps most impactful, has been the tandem utilization of the fiber columns in a two-dimensional HPLC approach to effect the isolation of both the primary mAbs produced in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell bioreactor and the adventitiously-produced EVs. This approach holds the promise that EVs, which normally are part of the mAb process waste, could be harvested as a value-added product.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nGreat strides and outcomes have been realized in the purification of a class of bio-nanobodies called exosomes. Exosomes are a small-sized (50-120 nm) subset of the extracellular vesicles. Exosomes are known to be primary vehicles for cell-to-cell communication and in the transport of proteins and genetic material. As such, there is great interest in the study and use of exosomes in fundamental biochemistry, clinical diagnostics, and therapeutic arenas. In the former case, surface proteins and genetic cargo reflect the cells of origin and their potential disease states. In the latter case, their ability to be selectively taken up by diseased cells and to discharge their contents allows targeted drug delivery. Exosomes have been isolated, purified, and quantified using C-CP fibers in column and spin-down tip formats from a variety of matrices, including serum, urine, saliva, cervical mucus, cell culture media, and most recently raw bovine milk. Purity levels and throughput far exceeding other processes such as ultracentrifugation and other size-based methods have been realized. The efficacy of the methods have been verified by a host of instrumental methods including electron microscopy, immunofluorescence assays, and proteomics analysis.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nDuring the course of this Division of Chemistry project, NSF funds have contributed substantially in the research described in 3 Ph.D. dissertations and 1 MS thesis, with 4 current Ph.D. candidates having received support. In addition, 1 undergraduate student participated in the project. In terms of products, 16 peer-reviewed journal articles have been published, with 3 more in process. Likewise, over 25 conference presentations have described the funded efforts. Inter-university collaborations with the Universities of Georgia, Michigan, Washington have taken place. Finally, 1 international patent application (CPT) is pending describing the implementation of the C-CP phases for the tandem separation/isolation/purification of both molecular (antibody) and vector species on a singular two-dimensional (2D) HPLC instrument.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/08/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RichardKennethMarcus\n"
