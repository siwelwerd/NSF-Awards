The award supports waivers of graduate student registration fees for approximately 120 students. The conference program includes many of the research topics central to Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics and Quantum Information Science. The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in atomic, molecular, and optical physics acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology. \r\n\r\nThe meeting is scheduled to be held May 31 through June 4, 2021. Originally planned to be held in Fort Worth Texas, the meeting will be held virtually due to the ongoing pandemic. The conference offers an opportunity for students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international community. Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US universities).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
