 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our economy and society rely heavily on information technology, which consumes an ever-growing amount of energy to process and store the world\u2019s information.  This makes energy-efficient, non-volatile memory systems a critical goal for future computers.  Magnets, where information is encoded in bits typically formed from ferromagnetic materials with \u201cnorth\u201d and \u201csouth\u201d poles with very much reduced size, currently store a huge amount of information.  However, these memory systems rely on magnetic fields to manipulate the poles, giving a technology with non-volatile storage but limited size and energy efficiency.  This project aims to achieve a low-current, based on materials with properties of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets, called a ferrimagnet by using all electrical means of manipulating nanoscale non-volatile magnetic memory.  A ferrimagnet has vanishing magnetization at a certain temperature which can be shifted with carefully engineered applied electric field.   This project will provide fundamental scientific knowledge and demonstration of this principle, for the fabrication of energy efficient, non-volatile, nanoscale magnetic memory and switching devices.  The project will involve graduate and undergraduate students  training and outreach activities involving collaboration with the student physics club, online spintronics seminar series and brown bag seminars. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on ferrimagnetic metal alloys and bilayers, with the overall goal of demonstrating voltage-based switching of memory elements using a detection scheme based on the anomalous Hall effect, and of spin transport sensors such as non-local spin valves. One specific focus is on a design of a new experiment to measure both the spin dephasing length and the spin diffusion length in ferrimagnetic metals. These measurements for a single material, will provide critical information for a range of spintronic systems and devices. The project will also explore voltage manipulation via electrolytic gating using an ionic gel. The project explores temperature-driven switching of the ferrimagnet as a first step toward eventual voltage-gated switching, which could also prove useful for applications in sensing. Research activities will involve characterization and development of ferrimagnetic metals, including SQUID magnetometry and thermoelectric and thermal conductivity measurements using unique micro- and nanomachined measurement tools.  The project has four main thrusts: (1) Developing, optimizing, and characterizing materials for ferrimagnetic spintronics, (2) Measuring the spin dephasing and diffusion lengths in ferrimagnetic metals, (3) Using a ferrimagnet to Realize Voltage-Driven Deterministic Magnetic Switching, and 4) Tuning spin direction in a ferrimagnetic non local spin valve.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project focused on understanding spin and potential control of spin effects in nanoscale devices formed from ferrimagnetic thin films. In these materials, two magnetic components point in opposite directions due to quantum mechanical interactions, but do not perfectly cancel under all conditions. This leads to materials with potential advantages of antiferromagnets (including potentially faster magnetic switching and protection from interference by stray fields) while keeping a key advantage of ferromagnets, the ability to control the system via the uncompensated magnetic moment. A ferrimagnetic system also typically develops a strong temperature dependence of the moment, importantly crossing through a point with zero moment, called the compensation point. The main goal of our research was to find ways to better understand and manipulate these systems to eventually build memory elements that could be useful for information technology. \r\n\n\n\n The intellectual merit work of our project encompassed growth of ferrimagnetic films via sputtering, and included work on two types of systems: one where two magnetic components are mixed together to form alloys, and a second where the two components are separated into thin films, and can only interact at the interface. The alloy approach has been explored for technologies for longer, and is known to present challenges for reproducibility of the materials due, in part, to the strong tendency for one of the magnetic components to attract oxygen. One of the main areas of new knowledge of ferrimagnetic systems that we contributed via this project was a clear demonstration that many of these challenges persist even in the seemingly simpler bilayer system. This has provided key fundamental materials knowledge that will help move the field of ferrimagnetic spintronics forward, and we continue to work along these lines. \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nWe communicated these and other Intellectual Merit results in six papers in refereed archival journals (two already published, one in the review process and three others in preparation), presenting 6 invited talks at conferences and University seminars, and via more than 5 contributed talks presented by PhD students.  \r\n\n\n\r\n\n\nThe Broader Impacts of this project included education and technical training and public outreach.
