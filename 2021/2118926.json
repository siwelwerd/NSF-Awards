 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although pandemics have threatened human civilization since ancient times, how to predict and prevent them remains a pressing challenge, calling for innovative insights and practices. Pandemics emerge through incidental \u2018perfect storms\u2019: molecular changes in pathogens, gradual trends in climate, subtle shifts in ecological interactions among potential hosts, and individual behavioral decisions by people, all colluding to make up the difference between an interesting but rare new variant of a known disease and an existential worldwide crisis. Being able to predict the emergence of pandemic threats, therefore, requires a fully integrated, multidisciplinary approach, able to consider the complexity of these realms across scales of interaction to predict and, ideally, prevent.  This workshop is one of four bringing experts from scholarly communities in the social and behavioral sciences, biology, engineering, and computer science together to discuss how to integrate the approaches taken by each community into a more effective, unified science of pandemic prediction.  The focus of this workshop is on developing understanding of how human attitudes, social behavior, and the drivers underlying both shape patterns of infectious-disease transmission and efforts at control and eradication.  This fundamental understanding in turn will facilitate pandemic prevention and control decisions that leave us better prepared when confronted with future pandemic threats.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is structured to focus on four topical areas of crucial importance, dealing with cultural transmission, information and communication, equity, and sustainability. The white paper that comes from this workshop will provide important guidance for incorporating insights into the social and behavioral sciences into predictive intelligence and pandemic prevention.   It will inform future research investments, institutional capacity-building, and other policy priorities aimed at keeping the US and the world safe from inevitable future pandemics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The workshop virtually brought together over 250 researchers and practitioners from diverse fields.</p>\n<p>Human behavior is central to the origins, transmission, and control of infectious disease. Population and economic forces, both of which are aggregate outcomes of human behavior, lead to the conversion of wildlands, expanding the human-animal interface where zoonotic spillover becomes more likely. Livelihood-related behavior exposes people to potential zoonotic spillover and mobility moves spillover infections to population centers where they can establish a foothold in human populations. Every transmission of an infectious disease is a social event: by whatever the appropriate mechanism, a susceptible individual must make contact with an infectious one. Norms, customs, social rules, and policies structure who interacts with whom and therefore leave traces of who gets sick and who is spared. Control of infectious disease depends critically on reducing effective contacts within the suspected population. Once again, cultural norms, customs, social structure, risk attitudes, and government policies play a fundamental role in the success of control and mitigation measures. Given the clear centrality of human behavior and social organization to infectious disease, it is surprising how few formal linkages exist between the social sciences and pandemic-control policy.</p>\n<p>Despite the centrality of human behavior to both the origins and control of pandemics, it is strangely absent &ndash; and frequently discounted &ndash; in both scientific and policy discussions of pandemics. A common refrain throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was some variation on the statement that \"the science is clear; it's human behavior that's the problem.\" Naturally, this statement belies the fact that there is, in fact, a science of human behavior and that if human behavior is the \"problem,\" it should be incorporated more broadly into the science of pandemics.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A major obstacle for further development of an integrative pandemic science that incorporates human behavior is the dearth of scholars with expertise in both the social sciences and some aspect of pandemic prediction and control.</p>\n<p>The Human-PIPP Workshop included four substantive sessions on topics of social relevance for pandemics. These included: (1) Cultural Transmission, Identity, and Groups, (2) Equity, Access, and Community Engagement, (3) Information, Communication, and Misinformation, and (4) Sustainability, Longevity, and Institutional Memory of Preparations. The workshop was capped off by a summary session.</p>\n<p>We concluded the workshop by identifying four <em>Grand Challenges</em> for incorporating the behavioral and social sciences into pandemic prediction, prevention, and control:</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\"><ol>\n<li><span>Incorporate the models and insights of the social and behavioral sciences into the mathematical and computational models used to forecast, predict, and develop interventions for pandemics. This goal goes beyond incorporating increasingly fine-grained mobility data into such models. Rather, it is about generating </span><span>theory-driven </span><span>models capable of reflecting, for example, scientific understanding of behavior change, social structure, and economic inequality into these important tools for pandemic prediction, prevention, and control.</span></li>\n<li><span>Develop strategies to increase trust. Trust at multiple levels is essential for pandemic control: there is the need for trust of institutions such as the different levels of government, with more abstract institutions such as science and public health, within and between communities. The breakdown of trust in US society has made controlling the COVID-19 pandemic far more difficult than it otherwise would have been. There are substantial challenges for cultivating trust in highly heterogeneous populations and, since the diversity of society is unlikely to decrease in the future, developing strategies that foster trust in heterogeneous societies should be a major priority moving forward.<br /></span></li>\n<li><span>Combat health misinformation. This involves understanding why people (or particular groups of people at particular times) are susceptible to misinformation as well as developing strategies to combat misinformation in real time. This would require going from mechanistic models of misinformation transmission, to utilizing and advancing theories in different pertinent disciplines (e.g., cognitive science, information science, psychology, public health) to identify why such misinformation spreads, and how it can be countered.<br /></span></li>\n<li><span>Developing research networks that bring together scientists from epidemiology, biology, mathematical and computational sciences, and the social and behavioral sciences. The scale and complexity of pandemics require multidisciplinary approaches to science and policy. Achieving success in answering grand challenges will require a rethinking of the social organization of relevant science. Approaches similar to the NASA matrix organization system may hold promise but what is clear is that this organization will need to span existing institutions since no one institution possesses the critical mass necessary.<br /></span></li>\n</ol></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/02/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: James&nbsp;H&nbsp;Jones</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2118926/2118926_10716269_1656792671614_report_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2118926/2118926_10716269_1656792671614_report_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Graphical Summary of Session #1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2118926/2118926_10716269_1656792671614_report_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Graphical Summary of Session #1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Graphic summary of the \ufffdCultural Transmission, Identity, and Groups\ufffd session held on March 22nd, 2021 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXf36aL380U.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Patricia Selmo</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;H&nbsp;Jones</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Graphical Summary of Session #1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2118926/2118926_10716269_1656792741331_report_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2118926/2118926_10716269_1656792741331_report_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Graphical Summary of Session #2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2118926/2118926_10716269_1656792741331_report_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Graphical Summary of Session #2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2.
