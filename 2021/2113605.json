 "awd_abstract_narration": "Statistical theory and methods play a fundamental role in scientific discovery and advancement, including in modern astronomy, where data are collected on increasingly massive scales and with more varieties and complexity. New technology and instrumentation are spawning a diverse array of emerging data types and data analytic challenges, which in turn require and inspire ever more innovative statistical methods and theories. This research is guided by the dual aims of advancing statistical foundations and frontiers, motivated by astronomical problems and providing principled data analytic solutions to challenges in astronomy. The CHASC (California-Harvard Astrostatistics Collaboration) International Center has an extensive track record in accomplishing both tasks. This research leverages CHASC\u2019s track record to make progress in several new projects. Fitting sophisticated astrophysical models to complex data that were collected with high-tech instruments, for example, often involves a sequence of statistical analyses. Several projects center on developing new statistical methods that properly account for errors and carry uncertainty forward within such sequences of analyses. Additional work will focus on developing theoretical properties of novel statistical estimation procedures to address data-analytic challenges associated with solar flares and X-ray observations. Other projects involve fast and automatic detection of astronomical objects such as galaxies from 2D or even 4D data. The PIs will develop statistical theory and methods in the context of these projects, building statistical foundations and pushing the frontiers of statistics forward for broad impact that will extend well beyond astrostatistics. The PIs plan to offer effective methods and algorithms for tackling emerging challenges in astronomy, with the aspiration of promoting such principled data-analytic methods among researchers in astronomy. Its provision of free software via the CHASC GitHub Software Library will enable the distribution and impact of the proposed methods and algorithms. \r\n\r\nThe projects reflect three broad themes: (1) Exploring fundamental statistical theory with immediate impact in astronomy, including a general approach for obtaining confidence regions by leveraging the pivot-property of maximal product spacing, which is then applied to assess the power law of solar flares, and a statistically principled correction to the use of the popular C-stat in astrophysics; (2) Assessing the misspecification of models and prior distributions in multi-stage statistical analyses, and post processing posterior draws to correct for defects in prior modeling when redoing a Bayesian analysis is impractical; and (3) Identifying breakpoints in complex models, which includes a fast algorithm for identifying astronomical boundaries and identifying breakpoints in joint spatial, spectral, temporal models. Theme 1 is more theory driven, while Themes 2 and 3 are more methods and computation driven. Together they form a rich suite of case studies for developing statistical methods for astronomical problems, ranging from new theoretical foundations to innovative modeling strategies and to efficient computational techniques.  Consequently,  the research will impact both the fields of statistics and astronomy: spurring more interest and new problems for statisticians and resolving long standing problems in astronomy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

With the increasing volume and complexity of data collected by modern telescopes, innovative methods are essential to help astronomers make sense of the information. Our research aimed to improve how we detect and understand astronomical objects, such as exoplanets and galaxies, using mathematical models, uncertainty analysis, and image processing techniques.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n\nThe intellectual contributions of this project lie in three key areas:\n\nModeling Object Boundaries in Astronomical Images: We developed a new, nonparametric method for modeling the shapes of astronomical objects. This method uses what are called Fourier descriptors to represent object boundaries in a way that is flexible and adaptable to different shapes, such as elliptical galaxies or spiral structures. Importantly, we applied bootstrapping (a statistical technique) to measure the uncertainty in these object boundaries. This means that astronomers can now better assess the precision of their observations.\nAstronomical Image Segmentation: We created a new algorithm to automatically detect and count astronomical objects in images. The method works particularly well in images that are \"photon-starved,\" meaning they contain very few visible light signals due to the vast distances of the objects being observed. This algorithm helps astronomers quickly identify objects in space and is faster than previous techniques.\nExoplanet Detection: Our work also contributed to the detection of exoplanets, planets that exist outside our solar system. By applying generalized fiducial inference, a relatively young statistical inference method, we were able to provide uncertainty estimates for key parameters involved in exoplanet detection, such as their radial velocities. These advances help astronomers better understand the likelihood of finding habitable planets in distant solar systems.\n\n\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n\nThis project has made other contributions beyond the immediate field of astronomy:\n\nNew Tools for the Scientific Community: The algorithms and statistical methods we developed have been released as open-source Python modules, making them accessible to a broad community of scientists. These tools can be used not only in astronomy but also in other fields where image segmentation and time-series analysis are important.\nTraining Future Scientists: Two graduate students were heavily involved in the project.
