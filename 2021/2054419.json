 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discrete geometry is the study of combinatorial properties of finite families of geometric objects. Results in this field often have applications to search algorithms, data classification, and optimization. The methods used to answer discrete geometry questions can be wildly different. Some are based on linear algebra, where the rigid structure of the space is important. Some are based on topology, and the results hold up to smooth deformations of the objects involved. This research project aims to develop new ways to use topological and linear algebraic methods in discrete geometry to expand the connections between combinatorics and other fields. The driving motivation is to understand what makes a combinatorial problem amenable to techniques from topology, and what makes it amenable to techniques from linear algebra. The project also includes topics that can be used to mentor undergraduate students in research.\r\n \r\nThe project focuses on questions related to finite families of convex sets. The PI plans to develop new ways to apply topological methods to Tverberg-type problems, related to a longstanding \"colorful\" version of Tverberg\u2019s theorem. The recent progress in quantitative Helly-type theorems can help build a bridge between the analytic side of convexity and linear programming, which the PI aims to formalize. Several of the questions under study aim to generalize classic results in extremal combinatorics to high-dimensional Euclidean spaces.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIntellectual merit\n\n\nOver the last year, the progress in this project has focused on the application of new topological methods to combinatorial problems. This is related to all three objectives of the proposal.\n\n\nOn one hand, the PI has been able to solve new problems mass partition results, which describe how one can achieve fair distributions of resources given geometric constraints of the partition pieces. On the other hand, the PI has also shown how some mass partitions results, which up to this point only had topological solutions, can be tackled without those techniques. This opens the door for new algorithmic approaches to this problems, so that we can tackle the computaiontal complexity of finding such fair partitions. Moreover, it opens new directions of research, as many similar problems may be solvable without topological techniques.\n\n\nBroader impacts\n\n\nIn addition to sending the results of this project for pulication to peer-reviewed journals, the PI has made them freely accessible in arXiv. The PI has communicated the results of this project in multiple conferences across the US and abroad.\n\n\nThe PI has mentored undergraduate students in research, focusing on problems related to this project. This was done in collaboration with the New York Discrete Mathematics REU. The PI has also organized a summer seminar at Baruch College that introduces students to the connections between combinatorics and linear algebra, and motivates them to apply for summer opportunities in mathematics.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/14/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: PabloSoberon Bravo\n"
