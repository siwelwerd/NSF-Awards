 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rotating a molecule without changing the chemical bonds it can form; braiding strands of hair, which is how quantum mechanics describes the structure of certain elementary particles; rearranging the nucleotides that make up the building blocks of a strand of DNA.  All of these\u2014rotations, braids, rearrangements\u2014are examples of group actions, namely families of symmetries satisfying structural constraints that arise from the context of each application.  This project studies group actions using combinatorial tools, including graphs and Young tableaux, in order to characterize their underlying algebraic structures.  Applications include other areas of mathematics (like knot theory and algebraic geometry) and other fields (like mathematical biology). The broader impacts of the project include continued leadership of the Center for Women in Math at Smith College, mentoring of students at all levels through the PI's Math Research Lab as well as professional development for graduate students and continued career advice for alumni of the Center for Women in Math.\r\n\r\nMore technically, this project addresses a set of interconnected questions about two graph-theoretic actions of permutations: 1) a skein-type action of permutations on a family of graphs called webs (of which noncrossing matchings are the best-known example), and 2) a representation constructed from graph automorphisms for a family of subgraphs of the Cayley graph of the permutation group. Each action is the nexus between several mathematical fields, giving rise to a cycle of related questions. In the first case, these are: combinatorially analyzing the transition matrices between two important bases of irreducible symmetric-group representations; describing the geometry and topology of components of Springer fibers; and constructing a basis for a vector space arising from questions in knot- and representation-theory. In the second case, they are: attacking the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture in combinatorics using a newly-established geometric correspondence; computing the (equivariant) cohomology rings of Hessenberg varieties; and describing generalized splines for different edge-labeled graphs. Recent work of Brosnan and Chow, Rhoades, and others mean that the field is poised for new advances.  The project exploits a synergistic strategy by attacking these interrelated questions simultaneously, and uses computational aspects of the work to incorporate mentoring and practical training of students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nGraphs are essential tools used to model and analyze networks of all kinds: digital, electrical, social, epidemiological, etc. The edges of a graph often come labeled with additional data that indicates the capacity of the edge; real-world applications try to optimize some aspect of the labeling. For instance, if the edge labels of a subway map indicate the capacity of each line at different times of day, we might want to maximize the total number of passengers that can be transported between two stations during rush hour; while if the edge labels of a road map indicate cost to plow the road, we might want to minimize the cost to plow paths between all essential services.\r\n\n\nThis research project attacked problems about labeled graphs using group actions to optimize different features. The first kind of labeled graph -- called webs -- arise in knot theory, representation theory, and combinatorics. The project resulted in the discovery of a new model of webs called stranding, by the PI with collaborator Russell, as well as student coauthors including Hafken, Lang, and Tashman. Stranding identifies many global properties of webs as paths through the graph, and thus led to a collection of interconnected results interpreting strandings through geometric data on objects called Springer fibers, through a kind of group action called strand flipping, and through a different kind of group action that rotates the webs.\r\n\n\nThe second kind of labeled graph -- called generalized splines -- is used in applications like data compression and data interpolation. Project outcomes include series of results by the PI and collaborators that describe degree-three generalized splines concisely, and develop tools from group actions to answer critical questions that can limit how unpredictably splines can behave.\r\n\n\nWith project support, the PI described this research as a keynote speaker at national and international conferences, as well as student-oriented workshops. During this period, the PI also supervised and trained over forty students at Smith College, primarily undergraduate and postbaccalaureate students. Published outcomes include eleven papers accepted, in press, or published; one other paper submitted and under review; and six others in progress.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/23/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JuliannaTymoczko\n"
