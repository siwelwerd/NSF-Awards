 "awd_abstract_narration": "The future of materials is often thought to entail bottom-up construction of three-dimensional systems to the highest possible precision. Biomolecules intrinsically program their own structures, interact with high precisions and are able to self-organize in complex structures. This project relies on these capabilities and aims to use the informational character of DNA to program biomolecules so that predesigned, highly-precise, 3D arrangements can be achieved. Such developments would benefit a range of scientific and technological fields including soft materials, biomedical interfaces, drug delivery, computational devices, and centuries-long information storage. The project merges chemistry and biochemistry with theoretical computer science and mathematics from three universities so that exceptional opportunities will be provided for interdisciplinary student training.\r\n\r\nThis project is designing DNA-heteromatter motifs and demonstrate algorithmic DNA self-assembly that is authentically three-dimensional. A prototype of 10x10x10 storage units is being built whose seed is made of three DNA origami-based planes, and the cube is filled with algorithmically-arranged tensegrity triangle blocks. The project will develop methods for storing and retrieving 3D information that is algorithmically derived. These methods are based on X-ray ptychography, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM), and high-throughput DNA sequencing to ensure that the designed systems will be readable and usable for centuries. Through mentorship and training, the project is helping to reduce the diversity gap between the national population and tenured faculty at research institutions by providing professional development to undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral participants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
