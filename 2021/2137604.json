 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carlos Yero is awarded an NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at Old Dominion University.  Yero will lead two experiments at Jefferson Laboratory in Newport News, Virginia, that will investigate the short-range correlations between pairs of nucleons (neutrons and protons) to better understand the short-range part of the nucleon-nucleon interaction.  One experiment will measure electron scattering from Ca-40 and Ca-48, two isotopes of calcium, to explore how the pairing up of neutrons and protons is affected by the eight extra neutrons in Ca-48.  The other experiment will measure electron scattering from deuterons, which are made from a single neutron bound to a single proton and are the simplest of all nuclei.  The deuteron experiment will be done at very high momentum and provide information on the nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction over very small distances.  Yero will involve high school and undergraduate students in this research through the Old Dominion University HALES and REYES outreach programs, both through research mentorships and through lectures in both English and Spanish.\r\n\r\nAt extremely short range, pairs of nucleons interact very strongly, and briefly fluctuate into a Short Range Correlation (SRC) pair with very large relative momentum. These pairs are predominantly proton-neutron pairs. They account for all of the high-momentum nucleons and most of the kinetic energy in the nucleus. Studying the abundances and properties of these SRC pairs will inform researchers about nuclear structure, nucleon structure modification in the nucleus, and the NN interaction at very short distances.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The <em>CaFe </em>experiment explored the pairing mechanisms of short-range correlations (SRCs) in a&nbsp; variety of nuclear targets (Be-9, B-10,11, C-12, Ca-40,48, Fe-54, Au-197), where the effects of adding either only protons or neutrons is&nbsp; currently being investigated in detail. The&nbsp;<em>deuteron repulsive core</em>&nbsp;experiment explored the proton-neutron interaction at very short distances (&lt; 1 Fermi) where the force is extremely repulsive and not well understood, both theoretically and experimentally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Very preliminary results from <em>CaFe</em> experiment &nbsp;[see Fig. 1 (top)]&nbsp;show relatively good agreement in the shapes between the data and theory calculations for both the mean-field or MF &nbsp;(&lt; 250 MeV/c) and SRC&nbsp;(~350-700 MeV/c) recoil neutron momentum. For SRC, the ratio is relatively&nbsp; constant which is indicative of the universal behavior of SRCs, a property known as scaling, where 2 nucleon-SRC pairs essentially exhibit the same behavior&nbsp; regardless of the nucleus they are in. The mean field part, however, is less understood, and would need to be further investigated. The Fig. 1 (bottom) panel show the SRC ratio of Ca-48/40 which seems to be near unity. This is a very interesting and surprising results as it would seem to indicate that&nbsp; adding +8 additional neutrons (Ca-48) to the nuclear shells has no effect on the number of high-momentum protons observed (hence the ratio ~1). This means&nbsp; that the outer-shell neutrons exhibit very weak or no cross-shell pairing with the protons in the lower energy shells.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The very preliminary online results from the <em>deuteron repulsive core</em> experiment [see Fig. 2] show raw absolute cross sections (or probability of interaction) compared to a&nbsp; theoretical model by J.M. Laget (2005). These cross sections still need significant additional corrections, but at&nbsp; least it gives us an idea of the quality of the data that was taken. A relatively good agreement&nbsp; can be observed between the online data and our previous measurements up to a finite range in missing momenta. The theory calculations, however, are unable to describe the data as&nbsp; shown by the rapid fall-off of the cross-sections compared to the data.&nbsp; These data in the overlap region would need to be combined to improve the statistical uncertainties. Additional theoretical calculations using other nucleon-nucleon interaction models are still needed for additional&nbsp; comparison.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In summary, both of these experiments show promising initial results which are pushing the boundaries of our understanding of short-range nuclear physics and have the potential of making new and interesting discoveries in this field.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/25/2024<br>\nModified by: Carlos&nbsp;Yero</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137604/2137604_10836903_1706241892248_deut_online_prelim--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137604/2137604_10836903_1706241892248_deut_online_prelim--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Deuteron Repulsive Core Experiment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137604/2137604_10836903_1706241892248_deut_online_prelim--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Deuteron Repulsive Core Experiment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Very preliminary online absolute deuteron break-up cross-sections compared to existing data (Yero et. al., 2020) and theoretical calculations by Laget (2005).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carlos Yero</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carlos&nbsp;Yero\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Deuteron Repulsive Core Experiment</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137604/2137604_10836903_1706240733619_cafe_prelim_nsf--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137604/2137604_10836903_1706240733619_cafe_prelim_nsf--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"CaFe Experiment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2137604/2137604_10836903_1706240733619_cafe_prelim_nsf--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"CaFe Experiment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1: (top) Ratio of nucleus A to C-12 counts at the MF (left) and SRC (right) kinematics.
