 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project that is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation\u2019s Directorate of Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (UKRI/NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement. This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget and the investigators associated with its own investigators and component of the work.\r\n\r\nThis research addresses the influence of reactive halogens on the oxidation capacity (the reactivity) of the atmosphere. A measurement campaign will be conducted at the BIOS Tudor Hill Marine Atmospheric Observatory in Bermuda to measure reactive gaseous halogens (bromine, chlorine, and iodine species) and their aerosol-phase counterparts. The results of this research will improve the process level representation of reactive halogen chemistry in atmospheric chemical transport models, increasing the ability to accurately predict the concentrations of pollutants such as ozone in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe observations supported by this effort will include what are expected to be the most abundant reactive gaseous bromine, chlorine, and iodine species (HCl, BrO, ClNO2, IO, among several others) and their aerosol-phase counterparts (Br-, Cl-, I-) from which the gas-phase species are derived. For gas-phase species, three different observational techniques (CIMS, LP-DOAS, TILDAS) will be employed, allowing for comparison of the measurements of some key reactive halogens while also expanding the suite of measured halogen species. A chemically detailed representation of the halogen chemistry will be included into the GEOS-Chem model as part of this project. This project will support three U.S. graduate students and one U.K. graduate student, providing these students with experience in field work, global modeling, and international collaboration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

ASU BIOS Data Labs are digital resources providing curated oceanographic and atmospheric datasets along with supporting media for educators. The goal was to enhance data literacy by making large datasets more accessible and relevant to students studying broader ocean and atmospheric phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecific Objectives:\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nDevelop an interactive data module for students to confidently download, manipulate, and analyze datasets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nEstablish a community of practice to test, refine, and integrate the data labs into university, college, and community college curricula, including field courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nCo-design a user-friendly interface enabling students to explore NOAAs Global Monitoring Laboratory ozone data repository.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nCreate a DataTaste feature to scaffold data visualization confidence in a student-led, stepwise manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nDesign a DataByte lesson that allows students to download and analyze curated datasets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nProvide tools for students to locate seasonal air masses and analyze historical ozone trends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nOptimize the modules design and web user interface and develop an implementation plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nDisseminate the module to a broader educational audience.\r\n\r\n\r\nSignificant Results:\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nTwo interactive data modules were developed, tested, and refined based on user feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nA community of practice consisting of ten professors from community colleges, colleges, and universities was formed to implement the module in classrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nThe user interface was optimized, migrated to ASU BIOSs Drupal format, and refined for ease of use and formative assessment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nA DataTaste feature was introduced to provide students with additional scaffolding before downloading their own dataset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nA DataByte was built and tested, facilitating the download of .csv ozone datasets for analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nA concluding module section was designed to help students explore seasonal ozone trends in Bermuda and Hawaii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nThe module continues to be revised as it is utilized annually in multiple courses at ASU BIOS and within the community of practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Outreach and Community Engagement\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nData Workshops: Hosted one interactive workshop for ten community college professors at ASU BIOS where this module was tested and refined with support of additional funding from NSF OCE-1948162.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nPartnership with Local Schools: Developed an educational partnership with Delaware Valley University, integrating this module into their annual field Chemistry course at ASU BIOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

Infrastructure and Capacity Building\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nOpen-Source Data Sharing: Published educator-friendly datasets in publicly accessible repositories to facilitate future research collaborations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nCollaborations with Experts: Partnered with the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Office (BCO-DMO) to learn more about best practices in creation of data modules.\r\n\r\n\r\nImpact and Future Directions\r\n\n\nThis project has had a lasting impact on STEM education. By integrating research with outreach and training the module has supported over 300 students to date.
