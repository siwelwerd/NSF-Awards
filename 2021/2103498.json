 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of portable technology solutions to allow Americans with disabilities to interact with the environment around them to increase their freedom and mobility. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 26% of Americans have a disability.  Current assistive technology is limited in what it can do because of the constrained processing powers that may be fitted in the confines of a portable device.  The proposed technology provides a means for transferring heavy processing to cloud-based servers that can draw on sufficient power to do the necessary work on a continual basis. The individual devices will be combinable and customizable in order to meet the individual needs off each user and to allow for maximum usability and value.  Technologies currently exist to aid people with disabilities to interact with their environment, however, the uptake of these devices has been very limited. The goal of this project will be to identify the reasons for this gap and use the data to ensure solutions meet the needs of the disabled community. The proposed solution will create individualized personal environmental support for the users to improve their mobility.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of advanced technologies in 5G, the Internet of Things (IoTs) and smart city applications. Currently, many cities have taken on smart city and urban computing initiatives where a set of disjointed sensor networks have been deployed in various parts of the city. These include: motion sensors, video cameras, biological sensors, audio recorders, fire detectors, gunshot location systems, and other monitoring tools.  The proposed technology is based on a cyber-physical system framework to bridge the physical space, cyberspace infused and Internet of Things (IoT). For example, people with vision loss or other special needs may have difficulties in perceiving signals directly in physical space, but they may be able to make these connections in cyberspace. These cyber connections and real-time information exchanges may enable and enhance their interactions in the physical space and allow them to be more aware of the environment around them.  This project may be accomplished by integrating existing technologies and commercialized electronics, such as a 5G network, WIFI, GPS, computer vision and a wider range of sensor devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
