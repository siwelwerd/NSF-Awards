Food deserts are areas with limited access to nutritious and affordable food. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported in 2010 that 23.5 million people in the U.S. live in food deserts. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #2 Zero Hunger is to \u201cend hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture\u201d. The workshop will bring together diverse entities and groups to identify strategies and deliverables that are ready for acceleration to maintain the food supply chain in response to rapidly changing environmental stressors such as limited water and energy. \r\n\r\nThis workshop aims to advance a technical framework for the acceleration of use-inspired convergence research in this area of national importance by bringing together practitioners from public and private institutions including Minority Serving Institutions of higher education, industrial and academic research organizations, and other stakeholders. An ecosystem approach to re-envision our science and technology research approach to sustainable food supply is the main focus of the workshop and seeks to identify a path to sustainable systems that enable food security in extreme environments and food deserts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The increasing demand for water, food and energy resources in the face of a changing climate and continued population growth, make these vital resources increasingly scarce. Moreover, changes in climate, land use, resource consumption, and population growth are pushing some regions to no longer be able to support regional food requirements, contributing to large-scale human migration in parts of the world.

By 2050, a global population of 9 billion will increase water demands by 55%, energy needs by 80%, and food demands by 60%.
