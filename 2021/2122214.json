 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Track 2: IEP aims to increase the number of Associate of Science degree STEM graduates. This will be achieved through revising a developmental math course onto a problem-based learning theory, which is supported by research to increase course success and student retention. The project is led by San Jacinto College (SJC), a Hispanic Serving Institution two-year community college located in the Houston metropolitan area where academic attainment is low. STEM education is a priority and students of Hispanic or Latino origin comprise 59% of all STEM majors. Houston\u2019s energy, medical, and aerospace industries rely on STEM graduates, and need a more qualified and diverse STEM workforce. This project will pilot redesigned curriculum for a development math course which has an in-class transition from a non-credit bearing developmental introductory algebra course to a credit bearing college algebra course. The intent is to retain STEM majors and influence their progression in STEM pathways. Expected outcomes include improving pilot course completion success rates for minority students; increase graduation rates of STEM majors; increase percentage of students enrolling in a STEM pipeline science course after pilot course completion; engaging more students in STEM research; increase project impact through the Rice University Summer Institute in Math that provides math faculty professional development in problem based learning techniques and hosting a public website of project results. \r\n\r\nThis project hypothesizes that community colleges that adopt curriculum built on the problem-based learning theory co-designed by a four-year research university will improve student engagement, retention, and academic success for underrepresented minority STEM students. The project has three goals: (1) provide science-based learning strategies in developmental math to improve student engagement and retention, (2) improve faculty awareness of teaching and learning strategies in a unique co-teaching model, and (3) increase student success rates to positively impact the students\u2019 decision to persist into science courses for STEM majors. Two core components are the (1) creation of a Summer Institute in Mathematics (SIM) for SJC faculty, facilitated by Rice University\u2019s Tapia Center for Excellence and Equity and (2) implementing a new SJC math curriculum, where student participants\u2019 classroom involvement grows and an increased focus on key math content needed for subsequent science coursework is employed. SIM will focus on evidence-based theories via intensive pedagogy sessions for SJC math faculty, provide dedicated time for curriculum development, and offer research lab tours at Rice to observe math principles in current research advancements, with the intent to implement innovative curriculum early in the STEM pathway. A mixed-methods evaluation will be facilitated to gauge the effectiveness of the intervention to assist program administrators to identify the most advantageous aspects of this intervention for SJC faculty and students. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of the HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research (i) on engaged student learning, (ii) about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, and (iii) that improves our understanding of how to build institutional capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also draw from these approaches to generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nStrategically spearheaded through a collaborative partnership between San Jacinto College (SJC) and Rice University, the AIM for STEM (Incorporating Research-Related Activities in Developmental Math to Increase A.S. STEM Graduates) program offered a three-year immersive and experiential pedagogical experience for selected community college faculty members. Fundamentally, AIM for STEM aspired to increase preparedness among community college students enrolled in remedial mathematics through the delivery of engaging coursework to accelerate academic advancement and encourage retention and eventual transfer to a four-year institution. As a facet of AIM for STEM, the Summer Institute in Mathematics (SIM) provided intensive and highly structured professional development for participating faculty members, facilitated by tenured educators, Dr. Paul Hand (Co-Principal Investigator) and Ms. Karen Kassekert. Annually, SIM was offered as a multi-week experience for faculty members on-site at Rice University in Houston, Texas, where competitively selected participants were provided with guidance to develop a mathematics curriculum focused explicitly on Project-Based Learning (PBL) and infused with real-world applicability. Purchasing a vehicle, a home, and financing travel were among the projects developed for implementation by the cohort during the summer 2024 SIM, for example. Importantly, each problem was geared towards engaging students in PBL, while underlining the importance of mathematics in daily decision-making. Thereafter, during the fall academic semester, faculty members introduced and implemented this innovative curriculum in their classrooms. An external evaluator was secured to collect mixed methods data throughout the established period of performance to infer the efficacy of this intervention for both faculty members and students.\r\n\n\nThe initial pilot year of SIM methodically introduced faculty members to curriculum development through a series of lectures and campus-based experiences at Rice University intended to heighten interest in STEM. Analogous to the first year, facilitators integrated lectures and other programming focused on STEM throughout the second summer. Moreover, during year two of SIM programming, faculty members were selected as either leaders or participants. SIM leaders were pivotal in providing critical feedback during the formative stages of curriculum (i.e., project) development; the previous experience they garnered as participants of the program was leveraged to assist their peers in identifying workable solutions and a sound framework. SIM participants worked cohesively with leaders assigned to each group to craft a project for classroom implementation. The culminating year largely mirrored summer 2023, and also concluded with integrating curriculum in classrooms across San Jacinto College. SIM was supplemented each year by distinguished guest lecturers including the Maxfield-Oshman Professor in Engineering and winner of the National Medal of Science, Dr. Richard A. Tapia, and a finale event that invited former and recent SIM leaders and participants, and SJC dignitaries, to a forum intended to feature the deliverables yielded as a result of programming. In addition, following the conclusion of SIM each year, a comprehensive report was developed by the external evaluator for dissemination to facilitators, the PI, and NSF. The report offered invaluable insight through quantitative and qualitative data analysis that enabled those leading the AIM for STEM program to make needed modifications to programming prior to subsequent years. Meticulous analysis of the data quantitative data yielded through the issuance of both pre and post-surveys for both faculty members and students suggested an overall efficacious intervention that not only increased self-efficacy among faculty members but amplified student interest in STEM learning. Qualitative data yielded from conducted focus groups with faculty members each year also demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction with both the AIM for STEM program and SIM and intimated an appreciation for the opportunity to work in parallel with eminent educators representing both San Jacinto College and Rice University.\r\n\n\nFollowing the completion of this period of performance for the SJC HSI Implementation and Evaluation (IEP) Project: Incorporating Research-Related Activities in Developmental Math to Increase A.S. STEM Graduates (AIM for STEM), the external evaluator will continue to work collaboratively with the Principal Investigator, Dr. Rachel Garcia, to draft a manuscript for peer-reviewed publication in the Journal for STEM Education Research, or a similar publication. The manuscript, currently in development, will focus explicitly on salient outcomes resulting from this intervention. More specifically, the publication will outline (in a mixed methods format) the quantitative and qualitative yielded since program inception. In addition, the publication will describe identified best practices that can be seamlessly leveraged by other institutions developing and implementing similar STEM-focused programming. Furthermore, this publication will highlight the critical importance of mentoring, peer-to-peer networking, immersive faculty professional development opportunities, and strengthening self-efficacy among faculty and students in mathematics to bolster student classroom success and retention.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RachelGarcia\n"
