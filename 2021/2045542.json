 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organized tropical convection can produce modes of variability on the intraseasonal timescale. Two prominent tropical modes are the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and the convectively coupled equatorial waves (CCEWs). They can generate disturbances that influence the extratropical atmosphere (i.e., the mid-latitude storm track and extreme weather events). Conversely, midlatitude atmospheric disturbances can propagate into the tropics to influence the MJO and CCEWs. This project aims to improve our understanding of the tropical-extratropical interactions associated with the MJO and CCEWs. Emerging results have the potential to improve subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction, enhance the nation\u2019s capability for weather forecasting, and advance our understanding of climate change. The project activities include the training of underrepresented students in research and broadening interests in atmospheric science among K-12 students in Oklahoma. These activities will inspire the next generation of diverse scientists.\r\n\r\nThe underlying mechanisms of the tropical-extratropical interactions associated with the MJO and CCEWs are still unclear. The main research goal is to understand the physical processes underlying these interactions from the energetics perspectives. The project intends to reveal (1) the atmospheric energy variability associated with tropical-extratropical interactions, (2) the role of energy exchanges among weather-to-climate timescales, and (3) how much of the tropical and extratropical kinematic and thermodynamic variabilities are sustained by their interactions. The investigator will analyze reanalysis and satellite data using various diagnostic techniques to understand the mechanisms that maintain global energy anomalies associated with the MJO and CCEWs. The project will integrate a K-12 summer in-person course that blends art and science to educate about the global atmospheric circulation including tropical-extratropical interactions. The developed educational activity modules will be shared online and through K-12 teacher training workshops. These research and educational activities serve as the foundation of the investigator\u2019s career-long vision to advance and broadly disseminate the knowledge of tropical-extratropical interactions.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the division of Atmosphere and Geospace Science (AGS) under the Climate and Large-Scale Dynamics (CLD) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
