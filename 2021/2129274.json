 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ocean life is being impacted by global climate change with the effects of increases in seawater temperature and ocean acidification on marine species and ecosystems being particularly apparent. Continued monitoring and analyses of the impacts of climate change are critical to our understanding of the current situation, as well as our ability to provide accurate predictions and to design and implement appropriate adaptation strategies. This project provides such infrastructure capacity through the establishment of a marine mesocosm facility at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS: http://www.bios.edu). Marine mesocosms, or a series of outdoor experimental aquaria systems with flowing seawater, help scientists examine species and their natural environment under controlled conditions. They provide an important bridge between strongly controlled single species laboratory- based experiments and largely \u2018un-controllable\u2019 in situ (in nature) experiments and observations, thereby offering a more realistic understanding of how environmental changes affect organisms and, consequently, community structure and ecosystem functioning. The facility will have the ability to accurately manipulate and measure environmental parameters, such as seawater temperature, flow rate, ocean acidification, and light, which are essential for making realistic predictions on global change impacts to marine ecosystems. The new facility will have a far-reaching impact on the research capacity of the marine sciences community through the promotion of collaborative and interdisciplinary research between BIOS and overseas scientists. The facility will also expand hands-on education opportunities by training undergraduate and graduate students to conduct and analyse complex multi-stressor studies. Local and visiting K-12 programs and public outreach will benefit from demonstrations and tours that communicate the research undertaken and technology utilized, as well as teaching modules, internships, and work shadow opportunities. In addition, dissemination of the research will demonstrate how global change facilities provide scientists with greater insights on how climate change will affect the marine environment. \r\n\r\nThis award provides funding to develop the Bermuda Marine Mesocosm Facility (BMMF), an infrastructure that is robust, easy to handle, versatile, and enables a wide range of near-natural organism- and community-scale single- and multi-factor manipulation experiments, which are vital to bridge the gap between research on physiological responses of marine organisms and community/ecosystem impacts. The main facility components of the BMMF include robust temperature control units for all basins of flowing seawater, which is fundamental for all experiments on marine organisms; a CO2 supply and monitoring system; and a number of supplies that increase the versatility of the facility: controlled seawater supply, natural and controlled sunlight, an increase in the number of basins and improvements to design, and a floating dock for immediate access to the marine environment. Together, these components will enable a wide range of experimental designs (from flume experiments to highly replicated organism-based experiments) to study marine ecosystem responses across various levels under both natural conditions and global change scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
