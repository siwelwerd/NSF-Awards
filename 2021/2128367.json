 "awd_abstract_narration": "A photonic crystal is a periodic structure for manipulating light propagation and optical applications, which is analogous to semiconductor crystals such as silicon for electronics. A perovskite is a semiconductor material with potential applications in solar cells and other devices. In this project, PIs will combine perovskites with photonic crystals for light generation and absorption. The perovskites will be confined inside tiny tubular material in order to improve their stability when they are under harsh environment such as intense light, moisture, and oxygen. The photonic crystal will be made in a way that light will be localized and amplified even if the photonic crystal has a fabrication imperfection. If successful, the project will lead to high-efficiency integrated lasers and solar cell devices. This project will enhance the abilities in the education arena by enriching program offerings for graduates and undergraduates, adding new capabilities in scientific research, expanding the range of laboratory exercises available to students, and training them as competitive next-generation workforce in nanotechnology and photonics technology. It also includes outreach activities targeting the general public via the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History. \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical part\r\n\r\nThe objective is to design, fabricate and characterize meta-photonic devices with high absorption and topological photonic devices using encapsulated perovskites in NiO nanotubes with a topological configuration that is immune to local disorders. Three approaches will be used: PIs will study the photo-stability of perovskites/NiO nanotubes under multiple-photon exposure, and their photoluminescence and electroluminescence in light emitting devices; Bound states in the continuum in the graded photonic super-crystal will be applied to the design of the resonant cavity with a very high quality factor for the lasing of the active medium of perovskites/NiO nanotubes. Disorders or broken in-plane inversion symmetry will be incorporated into asymmetric graded photonic super-crystals to achieve quasi bound states in the continuum that will be immune to the fabrication imperfection of NiO nanotubes; High-order Mie-resonances in individual NiO nanotube and bound states in the continuum will be utilized to achieve the broadband high absorption in perovskite/NiO nanotubes patterned in asymmetric graded photonic super-crystal. The goal is to achieve high-efficiency solar cells and electrically pumped laser in perovskite/NiO nanotubes patterned in the graded photonic super-crystal. The proposed research will have a significant impact on lasing medium in stabilized perovskites, micro/nano-cavity lasers, integrated optical circuit, miniature optical devices, and photovoltaic devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
