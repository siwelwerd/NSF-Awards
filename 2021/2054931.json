 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will enable mathematics instructors to build new knowledge and skills in an emerging area of STEM education research known as embodied mathematical imagination and cognition (EMIC). A sample illustration of the idea of EMIC entails having learners move their bodies in a way that represents an underlying mathematical concept such as rotation. Similarly, learners might manipulate other physical objects to represent more complex transformations; and the idea extends to virtual manipulations and simulations. This area of research has informed the design and creation of new resources, activities, and methodologies that can promote teaching and learning of a breadth of mathematical content, including concepts such as ratio, slope, and frequency, or tools to express equality or other algebraic relationships, or even theorems from geometry and complex analysis. Through this professional development experience undergraduate mathematics faculty and graduate students will weave ideas from the recently published Mathematical Association of America Instructional Practices Guide with EMIC research results.\r\n \r\nThe fifty participants of this two and a half-day workshop will (1) become familiar with EMIC research, (2) engage in a variety of EMIC activities, (3) create/build EMIC activities and materials for their own classrooms, including lesson plans and assessment strategies, and (4) seed a national community of practice of EMIC-informed undergraduate mathematics instructors. Selected products will be available to the wider mathematics education community via a website created for this project.  The workshop presents an opportunity to bridge research and practice at the collegiate level by introducing faculty to embodied activities and related research as well as providing a space to create their own activities that meet the needs of their own students. These embodied activities offer promise to help learners delve deeply into mathematical ideas that may sometimes be obscured by the algorithms and procedures they are taught. The workshop will also allow the project team to increase the number and diversity of the community of investigators who are bridging research and practice related to embodied cognition and design.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The workshop was held on September 25-26, 2021; we had 42 participants, 4 invited speakers, and the 7 members of the leadership team. The goals of this project were for participants to (1) become familiar with EMIC research, (2) engage in a variety of EMIC activities (as we have done at PME-NA), (3) create/build EMIC activities and materials for their own classrooms, including lesson plans and assessment strategies, and (4) seed a national community of practice of EMIC-informed undergraduate mathematics instructors.</p>\n<p>Participants learned about EMIC research and engaged in activities facilitated by the invited speakers and the leadership team. Nathalie Sinclair (Simon Fraser University) discussed EMIC and Design Practices using IPAD apps that she created. She emphasized the role of touch and sound in learning. Brooke Ernest (California State University - Channel Islands) discussed EMIC and Classroom Practices by sharing several projects that she has implemented in a projective geometry course. She emphasized the role of imagination in learning mathematics. Molly Kelton (Washington State University) discussed EMIC and Assessment Practices using museums as the setting. She emphasized how embodied activities could serve a role in equitable assessment. Finally, Francisco Ortega (Colorado State University) discussed the role of&nbsp;gesture in augmented realities. Each of the leadership team members also presented evidenced-based activities and research. For example, Candace Walkington shared her research and activities related to collaborative environments where the participants used Oculus goggles to engage in a data science related activity.</p>\n<p>Participants were also part of a working group. One working group, consisting of 9 participants, focused on mathematics for PK-6 prospective teachers, another group of 16 participants focused on mathematics for 7-12 prospective teachers, and the third group, consisting of 17 participants, focused on collegiate mathematics. In teams the participants imagined and designed embodied activities for the virtual and physical world that they could implement into their courses.</p>\n<p>Because the workshop was virtual, we did not meet for as long as if we had met face to face. As such the participants did not actually build the activities like we had planned.
