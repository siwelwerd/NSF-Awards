 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is the National Member Organization representing the United States in the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), an international research institute located in Laxenburg, Austria. The NAS carries out its membership responsibilities through the U.S. Committee for IIASA, housed in the Board on International Scientific Organizations (BISO). These responsibilities take two forms: participating in governance of the Institute through participation in the IIASA Council and direct interaction with the organization; and facilitating and encouraging U.S. interest in IIASA's activities. The goals of this award, to be performed by BISO and the U.S. Committee for IIASA, reflect both the IIASA Strategic Plan, 2021-2030 and the BISO Strategic Plan, 2019-2024, and are to help build and promote strong science programs at IIASA, and to strengthen and promote a strong U.S.-international, IIASA-related network. \r\n\r\nIIASA has made and continues to make important contributions to complex global issues by using a systems analysis approach to advance and inform both science and policy and covering topics of societal importance such as food and water security, biodiversity and sustainability, systemic risk and resilience, and climate change and population.  IIASA\u2019s goal is for its research to be used for policy solutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
