 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professor Stephen Naculich at Bowdoin College.\r\n\r\nTheoretical elementary particle physics seeks to develop mathematical models that can explain the nature and behavior of the smallest constituents of matter (the so-called \"elementary particles\").  As part of his research, Professor Naculich aims to develop more efficient mathematical tools for calculating the predictions of existing models that describe the behaviors of quarks and gluons, particles that are important for understanding the strong interaction, and extending these methods to more general theories.  A second goal of this research is to explore links between these sorts of theories and theories that describe the behavior of gravitons, the particles responsible for the force of gravity.  The insights gained through this research will be disseminated through journal publications, seminars, and conference proceedings.  As a result, this research will advance the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.  This project is also expected to have significant broader impacts, since it integrally involves participation by undergraduate students.  It will therefore contribute to their education by providing hands-on training in research methods in theoretical physics.  Such involvement will encourage and prepare highly-talented students for graduate study and careers in critical scientific fields.\r\n\r\nIn more technical terms, this project will focus on the structure of perturbative scattering amplitudes in gauge theories and gravity, and the relations between them.  In particular, the project will explore the Regge (or very high energy) limit of scattering amplitudes in nonplanar supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to all orders in the loop expansion,  combining group theory methods, explicit loop-level results, the known structure of infrared divergences, and eikonal methods.  It will also investigate, using similar tools, the Regge limit of scattering amplitudes in gravity and supergravity, and its connection with the two-body problem in general relativity and gravitational wave generation.  Finally, this research will involve the continued exploration of the recently discovered \"color-factor symmetry\" of tree- and loop-level gauge-theory amplitudes, and its relationship to color-kinematic duality in general gauge theories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis grant has supported research that is part of an on-going effort by the world-wide community of theoretical elementary particle physicists to develop mathematical models to explain the nature and behavior of the smallest constituents of matter (elementary particles). More specifically, this research has aimed at achieving a deeper understanding of, and at developing more efficient mathematical tools for calculating the predictions of, existing models of quarks and gluons called \"gauge theories.\" A second goal of this research has been to elucidate more fully the predictions of the theory of gravity, which at the fundamental level involves the behavior of particles called gravitons. A final goal has been to uncover unexpected links between gauge theories on the one hand, and gravitational theories on the other.\n\nOne of the methods of studying these models is to calculate \"scattering amplitudes\" which are used to find the probabilities of various events that can occur in an experiment. Typically the largest contribution to a scattering amplitude is the so-called \"tree-level approximation\" but substantial contributions can also come from \"higher-loop corrections.\" The calculation of both tree-level and higher-loop amplitudes is traditionally done using a tool called a \"Feynman diagram,\" and can be extremely complicated, if not prohibitively difficult. Over the last couple of decades, alternative approaches for calculating amplitudes have been explored.\n\nThis grant has resulted in several findings, described below, all of which have been communicated to the larger particle theory community in the form of three papers published in refereed journals, and in seminars delivered at other universities and at international workshops and conferences. Two of the three findings described involved the participation of undergraduate students.\n\nIt is well known that the behavior of scattering amplitudes becomes much simpler when the energies of the scattered particles become large, in the so-called \"Regge limit.\" Under a previous grant, a relationship was conjectured between supersymmetric gauge theory amplitudes and supergravity amplitudes in the Regge limit, which agreed with known results at one and two loops. One of the findings of the current grant was to establish the validity of the conjectured relationship at three loops. Also, it was also shown that one-, two-, and three-loop supergravity amplitudes in the Regge limit can be expressed as a modified sum of ladder and crossed-ladder diagrams, which can be related to the so-called \"eikonal\" representation of gravity amplitudes.\n\nUnder a previous grant, tree-level gauge-theory scattering amplitudes were discovered to possess a property called \"color-factor symmetry\", which leads to algebraic relations (called Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relations) between certain amplitudes. Color-factor symmetry was proven using a technique called the \"radiation vertex expansion\". A second finding of the current grant was to develop a new and much more efficient proof of tree-level color-factor symmetry using the so-called \"perturbiner\" approach, related to the Berends-Giele recursive method. It is hoped that color-factor symmetry could also be shown to apply to loop-level gauge theory amplitudes, thus casting light on the still mysterious color-kinematic duality.\n\nUnder a previous grant, a recursive method was developed to derive loop-level relations among gauge theory amplitudes based purely on group theory. This method was used to derive new constraints for amplitudes at all loop orders for four-point amplitudes for the group SU(N). A third finding of the current grant was a refinement and extension of this recursive method to derive new constraints for amplitudes at all loop orders for four-point amplitudes for the groups SO(N) and Sp(N). All of these constraints could be used to streamline calculations of scattering amplitudes at high loop orders.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: StephenGNaculich\n"
