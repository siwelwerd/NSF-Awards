 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part I: Nontechnical\r\nAntarcticas ice sheets constitute the largest ice mass on Earth, with approximately 53 meters of sea level equivalent stored in the East Antarctic Ice Sheet alone. The history of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet is therefore important to understanding and predicting changes in sea level and Earths climate. There is conflicting evidence regarding long-term stability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, over the last twenty million years. To better understand past ice sheet changes, together with the history of the Transantarctic Mountains, accurate time scales are needed. One of the few dating methods applicable to the Antarctic glacial deposits, that record past ice sheet changes, is the measurement of rare isotopes produced by cosmic rays in surface rock samples, referred to as cosmogenic nuclides. Whenever a rock surface is exposed/free of cover, cosmic rays produce rare isotopes such as helium-3, beryllium-10, and neon-21within the minerals. This project will involve measurement of all three isotopes in some of the oldest glacial deposits found at high elevation in the Transantarctic Mountains. Because the amount of each isotope is directly linked to the exposure time, this can be used to calculate the age of a surface. This method requires knowledge of the rates that cosmic radiation produces each isotope, which depends upon mineral composition, and is presently a limitation of the method. The goal of this project is to advance and enhance existing measurement methods and expand the range of possibilities in surface dating with new measurements of all three isotopes in pyroxene, a mineral that is commonly found throughout the Transantarctic Mountains. This technological progress will allow a better application of the surface exposure dating method, which in turn will help to reconstruct Antarctic ice sheet history and provide valuable knowledge of former ice-extent. Understanding Antarcticas ice-sheet history is crucial to predict its influence on past and future sea level changes. \r\n\r\nPart II: Technical Description\r\nMeasurements of in-situ produced cosmogenic nuclides in Antarctic surficial rock samples provide unique time scales for glacial and landscape evolution processes. However, due to analytical challenges, pyroxene-bearing and widely distributed lithologies like the Ferrar dolerite of the Transantarctic Mountains, are underutilized. This proposal aims to changes this and to improve the cosmogenic nuclide methodologies for stable isotopes (21Ne and 3He) and radioactive nuclides (10Be) in pyroxenes. Proposed methodological improvements will be directly applicable to erosion rates and deposition ages of important glacial deposits, such as the controversial Sirius Group tills, and also to younger glacial features. Bennett Platform is the focus of this study because it is one of the southern-most Sirius Group outcrops along the Transantarctic Mountains, where cosmogenic ages are sparse.\r\n\r\nPreliminary measurements demonstrate large discrepancies between 3He and 21Ne age determinations in Sirius Group pyroxenes. One possible explanation is composition dependence of the 21Ne production rates. Coupled measurements of 3He, 21Ne, and 10Be in well-characterized pyroxene mineral separates from Ferrar dolerite will be used to better constrain the production rates, major element and trace element dependencies, the assumptions of the method, and ultimately advance the application of cosmogenic nuclides to mafic Antarctic lithologies. \r\n\r\nThe main goals of this study are to improve measurement protocols for 10Be in pyroxene, and the determination of the composition dependence of 21Ne production rates by measuring mineral compositions (by electron microprobe), and nuclide concentrations in mineral pairs from young lava flows. Further aims are the validation of the nucleogenic contributions and the effects of helium diffusive loss through measurements of 3He/21Ne production ratios, combined with measurements of shielded samples of the Ferrar dolerite. Combined measurements of 3He, 21Ne and 10Be in pyroxenes have rarely been published for individual samples in Antarctica. The new and unique measurements of this study will advance the applicability of in-situ produced cosmogenic nuclides to both young and ancient Antarctic surfaces. The study will be performed using existing samples: no field work is requested.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
