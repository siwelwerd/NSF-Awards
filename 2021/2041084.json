 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this CAREER project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Ga\u00ebl Ung of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Connecticut is developing molecules capable of emitting circularly polarized light, light possessing right-handed or left-handed rotation with respect to the direction of propagation. This next-generation light source provides potential opportunities to enhance optical three-dimensional displays, bio-imaging, and security inks. The goal is to obtain molecules emitting strong circularly polarized luminescence in the visible and near-infrared region. This  is to be achieved by rigorous evaluation of the relationship between chemical structure and circularly polarized luminescence properties. This project is tied to a research program supporting low-income first-generation college students who typically work part- or full-time to sustain themselves, allowing them to be as successful as other students who can afford to take research in STEM fields without sacrificing financial stability.\r\n\r\nIn this project, Dr. Ung and his group examine the effect of symmetry, structural rigidity, and coordination geometry on the circularly polarized luminescence of lanthanide complexes. Modular ternary lanthanide complexes supported by chiral hexadentate ligands have been designed for the structure-function study. Two specific groups of lanthanides will be studied, either emitting in the visible region, or in the near-infrared region of the spectrum. An appropriate combination of chiral ligand and sensitizer will allow for the synthesis of molecules exhibiting strong circularly polarized luminescence. The team will also examine the effect of ligand substitution on the circularly polarized luminescence of chiral copper complexes, providing a more sustainable alternative for the development of circularly polarized emitters.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
