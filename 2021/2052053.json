 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This project will enable improved image quality and/or shortened scan time, increasing the throughput, and decreasing the cost of this modern diagnostic tool. Potentially, this technology will improve patient access to MRI.  \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project advances magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by constructing nonlinear metamaterial (NLMM)-enhanced surface coils to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The coupling between the NLMM and the surface coil will be investigated to optimize the SNR enhancement and avoid potential image artifacts through theoretical modeling and numerical simulation. The fabrication and implementation of the NLMM-integrated surface coil will be studied via the marriage of novel additive manufacturing and conventional screen-printing technology for mass production of such devices. The NLMM-enhanced surface coil performance will be optimized with the tandem development of image reconstruction algorithms to generate an improved MRI image acquisition by taking the field gradient induced by the NLMMs into account. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide highly integrated NLMM-enhanced surface coils to significantly improve SNR of MRI.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
