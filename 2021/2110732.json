The American Control Conference is internationally recognized as a premier scientific and engineering conference, dedicated to the advancement of control theory and practice. \r\n\r\nThe 2021 ACC technical program will comprise physical, virtual, or hybrid activities, including presentations in regular and invited sessions, tutorial sessions, and special sessions along with workshops and exhibits. Control theory and control applications considered in this conference, including energy, transportation, manufacturing, span research areas relevant to the mission of the National Science Foundation. This award will expand the opportunities in the fields of control science and engineering for women, minorities, persons with disabilities, veterans, first-generation students, and students from non R1 institutions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
