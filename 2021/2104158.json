 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the popular integration-based techniques for fluid flow visualization, line-based techniques have made significant advances over the years, providing a sharp contrast to surface-based techniques. Surface-based flow visualization is often regarded as one of the most challenging problems in scientific visualization. Flow surfaces can provide better illustrative capabilities and much-improved visualization compared to flow lines. However, existing surface-based flow visualization methods face substantial challenges related to surface selection, visualization, and analytics, calling for creative ideas and enabling solutions. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a machine learning-assisted visual analytics approach for understanding three-dimensional complex flow surfaces. The project contributes to the state-of-the-art flow visualization by providing end-to-end solutions that introduce an innovative deep learning approach to surface feature learning, investigate a new template-based visual interface for flow surface exploration, and explore occlusion reduction and relationship interrogation via visual transformation. The team will work with domain experts and apply the proposed solutions to study cardiovascular flow, aligning with the NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare.\r\n\r\nUnderlying the proposed work is a novel data-driven and user-centric approach for surface selection and exploration. The project will develop a new framework that supports (1) selection of representative surfaces through feature learning, projection, and clustering powered by graph neural networks, (2) exploration of surface patterns via a principled vocabulary-based method for shape-invariant partial flow surface querying and matching, and (3) comparative analytics of flow surfaces for studying seeding sensitivity or variability via a river-like visual metaphor. Research results will be evaluated through comparison against existing methods, assessment by domain experts, and a formal user study. Furthermore, for cardiovascular flows the project will investigate the hemodynamics of aortic dissection and intracranial aneurysm for solution validation. The project outcomes include (1) source code that implicitly learns surface features using graph neural networks, (2) a surface shape database based on the universal alphabet, and (3) an educational tool for teaching and learning flow surfaces. The general approach will impact other fields of study, including machine learning for visualization, shape analysis, visual analytics, and visualization in education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
