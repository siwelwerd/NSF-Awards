 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maintaining a successful workforce pipeline in modern micro/nanotechnology is a critical national need.  This project is designed to fill a demonstrated micro/nanotechnology industry need for job-ready cleanroom-manufacturing technicians.  Although community college students could help meet these industry needs, many community colleges lack access to semiconductor cleanroom facilities.  As a result, students at these institutions are unable to develop the cleanroom skills needed for entry into high-tech manufacturing positions. This project intends to provide community college students with access to onsite learning in manufacturing cleanroom facilities at the California Nanosystems Institute and the NSF-funded Nanofabrication Facility.  Through these experiences and related coursework, they will develop the knowledge and skills needed for work in cleanroom facilities.  The project can contribute to the local economy by increasing the number of competitive local applicants for cleanroom technician positions, which can in turn lower the need for on-the-job training and decrease employee turn-over.  \r\n\r\nThrough this project, Santa Barbara City College and the University of Santa Barbara will build a partnership to provide community college students with access to and training within cleanroom facilities. At these facilities, both community college faculty and students will be trained in cleanroom techniques.  They will also tour local manufacturing facilities to experience real-world applications of cleanroom technology. Santa Barbara City College faculty members will participate in regular Industry Advisory Board discussions, creating an avenue for two-way dialogue to align industry needs and college curricula. Students will be able to earn industry-vetted certificates that comply with those set by the semiconductor industry-standards organization, SEMI. By providing community college students access to cleanroom facilities, the project can prepare students for high-tech manufacturing positions. This project intends to lay the foundation for building a robust regional workforce pipeline to serve the larger micro/nanotechnology industry.  This collaborative partnership involving a community college, a four-year institution and local industry partners to develop an industry-backed curriculum is a model that could be adopted or adapted elsewhere. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
