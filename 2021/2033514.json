 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Hawaii, in collaboration with Montana State University and the University of Nevada Reno, will host a workshop to gather the necessary baseline data to characterize cyberinfrastructure (CI) capabilities across EPSCoR jurisdictions and institutions. As these resources are required to drive data and compute-intensive science forward, this workshop will address the issues of historical underinvestment in CI resources and services in EPSCoR jurisdictions and the uneven distribution and availability of these resources across the nation. Activities and deliverables of this workshop aim to enhance CI access and capability for research and education across EPSCoR jurisdictions, including under-resourced institutions. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this workshop are to increase knowledge of, and aid access to, CI capabilities across EPSCoR jurisdictions and beyond. Data generated by participants will allow insights into existing gaps, priorities, and challenges at local and national levels. First, participants will use the Research Computing and Data Capabilities Model (RCDCM) assessment tool paired with trainings to generate baseline CI data and ideas on how to increase CI access, planning, and partnerships. The workshop will include facilitated discussion, a case-study panel on regional collaboration, and group working sessions. The resulting open access report, publication, and related outreach activities will present aggregated and analyzed baseline data, interpreted findings, and planning and partnership initiatives to advance knowledge and understanding of participating EPSCoR institutions\u2019 CI capabilities and intentions. The workshop will be co-located with the EPSCoR Project Directors and Project Administrators meeting in Portland, Maine (or online, per circumstances).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
