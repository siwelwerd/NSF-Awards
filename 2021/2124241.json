This need is accentuated by the fact that after decades of aggressive miniaturization, electronic devices are currently reaching the end of the road for traditional materials as we \u201crun out of atoms\u201d. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, a relatively new class of materials consisting of few-atom-thick sheets, provide a platform to address these challenges. Particularly interesting are 2D transition metal carbides, known as MXenes, composed of two to four atomic layers of transition metals separated by an atomic layer of carbon. MXenes are studied for various applications, including energy storage and generation, blocking electromagnetic waves, and antenna. Despite significant progress, room temperature magnetism, important for quantum computation, computer memories, and spintronics, has remained elusive. With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, Professor Babak Anasori at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis and Professor Alejandro Strachan at Purdue University and their research groups will design and fabricate novel 2D MXenes that contain rare-earth elements, such as neodymium and gadolinium, and develop a fundamental understanding of how such elements can be used to control the electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of these materials. Computational modeling is used to guide the experimental design of these new materials and reduce the number of experiments to the most promising candidates. The team hypothesizes that the use of rare-earth elements in MXenes can lead to the first room-temperature 2D magnets. To accelerate innovation, all experimental and theoretical results produced and models developed will be made accessible for the researchers and educators for online computing. The microscopic images of nanomaterials and 2D materials have been used in many nanoart visualizations, such as NanoArtography, to promote STEM. The nanoart images will be integrated into local nanoscience outreach activities, such as Purdue\u2019s NanoDays, to motivate art-enthusiastic children to have a chance to learn about the science and engineering behind nanoart images.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\n2D transition metal carbide MXenes have become one of the largest 2D material families over the past decade. MXenes have metallic electrical conductivities, are hydrophilic, and capable of intercalating a host of ions and organic molecules, leading to outstanding performance in applications such as energy storage, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, wireless communications, catalysis, and biomedicine. Double-transition metal MXenes are a subfamily of MXenes that enable significant tunability in properties by changing the MXenes transition metal compositions. The research, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, aims to design, synthesize, and characterize a new family of 2D double-transition metal carbides: rare-earth (RE) f-element 2D MXenes opening the possibility of magnetic properties. This will be accomplished via a synergistic combination of theory and experiments. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of how different rare-earth elements can be incorporated into MXenes and use it to control the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of these novel phases. The limiting factor hindering f-element MXenes is their synthesis that requires the design of novel f-element MAX phase precursors among the large compositional space. This project uses high-throughput first principles and thermodynamic calculations to identify stable precursors and their MXenes and use data science tools to guide experimental efforts. Rare-earth f-element MXenes can have radically different properties that have never been measured in regular MXenes and are absent in other 2D and bulk materials. Rare-earth MXenes can have potential applications from EMI shielding, optoelectronics, and catalysis to quantum computation, spintronics, and magnetoelectronics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
