 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a one-day meeting \u201cThe Rising Stars in Cell Biology Symposium\u201d to be held on April 29, 2022 at Johns Hopkins University. The purpose of the meeting is to provide an opportunity to early career scientists (undergraduate, post baccalaureate, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows) from diverse backgrounds within the greater Baltimore area to present their research and network with their peers. The format of the meeting will comprise of one keynote talk, selected oral presentations, poster sessions, and career development platforms. In the short-term, this meeting will provide an opportunity to trainees to highlight their exceptional research, boost their confidence, expose them to a wide array of leading-edge research within cell biology, which may lead to increased recruitment of under-represented minority (URM) students into graduate programs or postdoctoral positions across the participating institutions. In the long-term, this meeting will attract URM scholars to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), specifically to life sciences and to generate a vibrant and supportive environment that encourages retention of URM scientists in academia.  \r\n\r\nThis meeting is motivated by the recognition of socio-economic disparity and the need for opportunities truly available to URM scholars. The award will defray the basic organizing expenses to reach a wide group of trainees as well as institutions that predominantly serve URM scholars in the greater Baltimore area. In particular, the award will provide support for the meeting participants in the form of travel vouchers, working meals, poster printing, and childcare assistance. Availability of opportunities provided by the meeting will showcase the trainees\u2019 work and form a peer network, which will encourage URM scholars to continue their academic pursuit and help increase diversity at higher ranks within academia. Additionally, with the participants from diverse backgrounds but sharing the common interest in cell biology, this meeting is expected to foster scientific collaborations at the forefront topics and advance research forward.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Despite the difficulty of the pandemic time, the Symposium proves to be a great success on several measures.</p>\n<p>First, the symposium had a great turnout and drew the representations from a very diverse background. Out of the 106 registered participants, 85 showed up in the symposium, representing 8 institutions (i.e., JHU., U. Maryland at College Park, U. Maryland at Baltimore County, NIH, Morgan State U., Howard U., George Washington U., and George Mason U). The only reason for no show-up was that they unfortunately got Covid during the re-surge of the pandemic in the late April. URMs constitute about 1/3 of the participants and 1/2 of the oral presentations. Females constitute 1/2 of the speakers and approximately 1/2 of the participants. And about 1/2 of the participants are non-JHU trainees. While majority of the trainees were graduate students and postdoc, about 1/3 of the participants are undergraduate students and postbacs. Out of the 9 selected talks, 5 were given by non-JHU trainees, 7 were presented by senior graduate students and postdocs, and 2 were given by postbacs. The symposium presented a unique platform promoting diversity in STEM.</p>\n<p>Second, both the talks and the poster sessions were packed with enthusiastic participants who showed great curiosity and high-level of research and Q&amp;A. Dr. Kandice Tanner from NIH delivered a passionate and inspiring keynote speech. She not only presented her research in cancer biology at the highest level but elaborated how as a Black woman she managed to succeed in scientific inquisition. She had extensive interactions with the trainees during her talk, poster sessions, coffee breaks and lunch. Many trainees, especially URMs, looked up to her and became more motivated in achieving higher education and research. Additionally, the 42 poster presentations in two sessions were well-attended and fostered extensive and lively discussions that extended well into the working lunch and breaks. 89% of attendees responded with &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for the survey question of &ldquo;Did you learn about any new research areas you would consider exploring in future?&rdquo; The symposium therefore promotes the awareness in the new research and foster collaborations and networking.</p>\n<p>Third, the after-meeting attendee survey overwhelmingly favors this symposium and hosting future ones.
