 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award leverages new fundamental understanding of human cognition and the extraordinary capabilities of current technology to support our Nation's capacity to nurture lifelong learning, advance economic competitiveness, and provide meaningful paths for careers subject to industrial transformation.  This workshop convenes experts in all elements of education at the human-technology interface (HTI) to address topics including: regional, socioeconomic, demographic, and other disparities in technology access and associated solutions; capabilities to address learning difficulties, variability in learning modalities, cognition development, and other needs driving customized education; opportunities for convergent research at the interface of neuroscience, education, and remote technology; industrial workforce development needs, transformations, and partnerships; and associated translational pathways for new solutions. This project advances our understanding of the landscape for next-generation leadership of the Nation's educational ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis project advances understanding in several technical disciplines, including: cognition variation by learning modality and associated assessment; transferability and generalizability of processes with varying levels of technology engagement; adaptive testing (customized automated evaluation processes); and scalability.  In addition to synthesizing current research in technologies and cognition, the workshop will explore promising practices in cohort formulation, implementation, and assessment; experiential education and integrated learning; inclusion, belonging, and other social processes driving educational outcomes; and other elements of holistic education to identify best practices toward translation at scale.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
