 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate research experiences and inquiry-based laboratories increase student retention, graduation rates, and motivation to pursue advanced degrees and careers in STEM fields. However, many undergraduate courses and labs are not structured to engage students in active learning and authentic research, and the lack of such innovative learning environments presents a key barrier to student success. This project will build on a curricular model developed at the University of Houston (UH) to bring cutting-edge research into undergraduate classes and prepare a STEM-literate workforce equipped for innovation. The Environmental Sampling Research Module (ESRM), which was designed, developed, and successfully implemented at UH over the past nine years, will be disseminated across a range of institutions, student types, and courses to engage students in interdisciplinary, collaborative research that populates a growing database of the geographic distribution of environmental contamination. A novel aspect of the project is a learning activity focusing on entrepreneurship, which will teach students how to bring their data to market. This topic is not common in academic science curricula.\r\n\r\nIntegrating education, research, and entrepreneurship, the ESRM will provide opportunities for students to engage in the process of scientific discovery by contributing to research data, mining their own and shared data, and marketing the products of their research. Six institutions will collaborate in the project: UH (Texas), Alvin Community College (Texas), Louisiana Tech University (Louisiana), Prairie View A&M University (Texas), Rochester Institute of Technology (New York), and Southern Utah University (Utah). (Three of those are on the Gulf Coast, where recent environmental disasters will provide valuable data on soil and water pollution and microbial remediation.) Activities of the project team will include developing interdisciplinary learning modules that use computational tools, comparative data analysis, genome-spatial analysis, and entrepreneurial applications; holding workshops to train faculty; mapping ESRM learning activities to interdisciplinary skill sets; and developing a web portal to disseminate the learning activities, the expanded ESRM database, information about students' research, and published papers. The project will contribute to STEM education research by exploring (1) how the adaptations of the ESRM benefit diverse students, institutions, and faculty and (2) how students' participation in collaborative, multi-institutional research experiences and exposure to authentic research questions influence their engagement and interest in STEM fields.",

This Environmental Sampling Research Module (ESRM), developed by the project&rsquo;s principal investigator, Dr. Rupa Iyer, has been successfully integrated into the University of Houston's undergraduate laboratory curriculum for 14 years. The core purpose of the ESRM is to provide flexible and adaptable research experience to enhance STEM motivation, retention, and competency with crucial skill sets. The ESRM engages students in hands-on research to isolate and identify organophosphate (OP) degrading bacteria and to populate a database with the geographic distribution of OP degrading activity. Students use their data to complete a series of STEM exercises that cover statistical analysis, bioinformatics, phylogenetics, and degradation kinetics to compare data within the databases and explore potential commercial applications. Contributing to the database and mining their data enhances STEM skills, gives students a sense of ownership in the research and better understanding of how it can translate into a product.</p>\n<p>This project had four overarching goals: (1) Use the ESRM databases to develop inquiry-based curricular learning material for training in interdisciplinary techniques. (2) Multi-institutional dissemination and integration of the ESRM to engage students in collaborative research. (3) Enhance STEM learning skills for real-world applications. (4) Develop a platform for education and research collaboration.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p>\n<p>The broader impacts of this project centered on multi-institutional collaboration among institutions that serve diverse, underrepresented, and isolated communities, geographic areas, and student types. This project involved the participation of two Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs) and community colleges, Alvin Community College and El Paso Community College, a Historically Black College and University (HBCU), Prairie View A&amp;M, three rural state universities, Tarleton State University, Southern Utah University, and Louisiana Tech University as well as one private university, the Rochester Institute of Technology. Survey results of 285 respondents suggest underrepresented groups in STEM were positively impacted, with 45% being minorities, 60% women, and 23% first-generation students. Project faculty worked to implement the ESRM across as many courses (Biotechnology, Microbiology, Soil Fertility, Soil Morphology, Environmental Genomics, and Environmental Sampling) and student types (freshman to senior, STEM, and non-STEM) as possible to maximize participation in the collaborative research experience. In addition, during and after the COVID outbreak, project faculty worked to adapt the ESRM and their curricula to hybrid or online formats. Online support materials, instructional videos, and an electronic lab notebook were designed for full online implementation. This development will help institutions unable to perform wet lab activities implement the ESRM in the future. Most partners found the experience adaptable with their existing curricula and sustainable moving forward. A total of six institutions out of eight retained the ESRM upon the conclusion of the project.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p>\n<p>The project's intellectual merit was shown in its capacity to advance STEM research knowledge, knowledge of the applications of said research, and foster faculty teaching development. Surveyed students reported a significant increase in their understanding and competency of biotechnology-related proficiencies, with a majority attributing this growth directly to in-lab practice, the supplemental STEM exercises, and their own data-driven experience with the project web portal. In addition, their overall ESRM experience increased their interest in the course material, the research process, and, more broadly, STEM in general. Our evaluation team found that course learning outcomes significantly impacted students representing historically marginalized groups in STEM. Formal testing also revealed several significant and marginally significant differences based on student gender and race, with the wet lab, curriculum, and web portal having an enhanced, positive impact on female students and students of color. Faculty partners benefited significantly from their experience and student feedback.
