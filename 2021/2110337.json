 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Coastal Pioneer Array was commissioned in 2016 and is located off of the coast of New England. It was developed as a relocatable asset, deployable over time periods appropriate to the scientific questions at hand. It has been four years since the commissioning and now is the appropriate time to consider the next location for the Pioneer Array. The proposed project will assist NSF in determining the next location for the Pioneer Array. The Sequestial Labs proposed would increase community participation in the scientific endeavors funded by NSF. The workshops are directly related to NSF\u2019s objective to enhance infrastructure for research and education and the outcomes would contribute to enhancing oceanographic science and would have important scientific, educational, and societal benefits. \r\n\r\nThe PI requests funding to hold community Sequential Lab events (Micro Labs and Innovation Labs) that will bring ocean scientists, educators, and other stakeholders together virtually to evaluate future location options for the Pioneer Array. These Labs will inform the selection of the next Pioneer Array site, as well as identify new science opportunities that can be offered by the next site. This information will assist the National Science Foundation and the OOI Program informing design decisions regarding sensor configurations of the future Pioneer Array. The Labs will be modeled after the Ideas Lab approach that has been effective in promoting innovation, collaborations, and idea sharing. The services of a facilitator will be utilized to design and deliver the Sequential Labs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Ocean Obsevatories Initiative (OOI) Pioneer Array was conceived as a coastal array suitable for moderate wave and current regimes on the continental shelf and upper slope. The Pioneer Array is currently located off the coast of New England, about 75 nautical miles south of Martha's Vineyard.\n\nThe Pioneer Array was developed as a relocatable asset, deployable over time periods appropriate to the scientific questions at hand.  It has been more than five years since the commissioning of OOI and now is the time to consider a new location for the Pioneer Array.  The first step in the relocation process is selecting the next site for the Pioneer Array and then identifying ways to optimize the Array design for its new site. \n\nA Virtual Sequential Labs approach was proposed to help guide the selection of the new Pioneer Array location.  The approach consisted of two phases that brought ocean scientists, educators, and other stakeholders together virtually (due to the COVID-19 pandemic) to evaluate 1) future location options for the Pioneer Array and 2) new design considerations that can enable exciting research endeavors at the new location. Each phase included a 90-minute Micro Lab and a multi-day Innovations Lab.  \n\nThe 2-Phase Lab approach was successful in informing a science-driven selection of the next Pioneer Array location at the Southern Mid-Atlantic Bight (S-MAB).  Members of the science community provided important feedback on priority science questions, that could best be addressed using ocean-observing platforms at the new location.   They provided recommendations that will expand the potential for new discoveries by highlighting the features of the Pioneer Array's sensor configuration that will optimize its observatory capabilities.\n\nThe Southern MAB region offers opportunities to collect data on a wide variety of science questions that span across the major observatory science themes including:\n\nOcean-Atmosphere Exchange and Coastal Storm Response\nClimate Variability and Ecosystem Response\nCoastal Ocean Dynamics and Biogeochemical Cycling\nSeafloor Processes\nPhysical Oceanography of the Shelf\nInteractions of Physical and Biological Processes\n\n\nResearchers and educators will be offered exciting research and discovery opportunities at the S-MAB site. There will be new opportunities for expressing the importance of the oceans to students and the general public. The Pioneer Array at its new location has the potential to expand observations and will enhance the partnerships and collaborations that are possible.  Important stakeholders that include fisheries and wind energy groups, as well as regional consortia will have access to newly available data. \n\nThe Innovations Lab participants helped to identify sensors and instruments that would be needed to make the measurements to address the high priority science questions. They offered feedback on sensor positioning, platforms, and sampling strategies. \n\nThe Innovations Lab approach provided an essential first step in the Pioneer Array relocation process.  Over the next two years, the OOI/CGSN team will begin work to design the Pioneer Array configuration for the S-MAB location.  The recommendations offered from the Labs provide useful considerations for optimizing the Array so that its data can address the broadest range of priority science questions.  \n\nThe Phase II Innovations Lab demonstrated that there is strong community interest and excitement in moving the Pioneer Array to the new S-MAB region.  There is strong potential for building new partnerships with government organizations, non-profits, the private sector, and educational institutions.  In the coming years, the OOIFB will work with the science community to explore ways to build these potential new partnerships that were identified in the Labs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Annette M Desilva"
