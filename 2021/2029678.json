 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although children existed and contributed to prehistory, much of the research on human evolution still focuses on adult behavior. Children\u2019s cognitive and physical abilities differ from those of adults, and therefore, researchers can expect to find variation in how individuals at different phases of development engage in evolutionarily important tasks such as stone toolmaking. Stone toolmaking is widely hypothesized to have played a role in human cognitive evolution, with ties to higher order brain functions such as planning, executive control, working memory, and language. Experimental archaeological methods are particularly well-positioned to investigate questions of age-related differences in learning stone toolmaking because it allows researchers to recruit living subjects, as opposed to analyzing archaeological remains, and examine how participants of different ages engage in a stone toolmaking task. Here, the focus is not just on the tools, themselves, but also on participants\u2019 behavior in making the tools and what sort of processes and conditions contribute to effective learning of the skill. This dual perspective promotes insight into the behavioral context surrounding stone toolmaking and can inform future research on the evolution of behaviors, such as teaching, that are fundamental to the human experience.  \r\n\r\nThis doctoral dissertation project investigates developmental differences in stone knapping (shaping) skill acquisition between adult and child subjects. Using experimental archaeological methods, 45 adult and 45 child participants will be trained in an Oldowan-style, \"least effort\" flake production task and compared using metrics of flaking success and individual differences in cognitive ability, physical strength, and personality characteristics. Individual differences data will also be used to investigate within group variation in behavioral correlates of successful skill acquisition for both adult and child participants. Addressing an understudied area of research on human origins, results of this project will have implications for the evolution of the human capacity for cumulative culture and may serve as a reference point for existing archaeological assemblages that show evidence of skill differentials between lithic artifacts. Additionally, this project will serve as a form of science education outreach as part of its design is as an archaeology-themed summer day camp for the children participating in the study.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

During this project, I recruited 50 participants (20 children, ages 8 ? 14 years, and 30 adults, ages 18 years and older) and asked them to complete a series of psychometric, motor, and stone toolmaking tasks. The goal of the research was to investigate how children and adults might learn how to make stone tools differently based on differences in their cognitive (e.g. executive function) and motor (e.g. upper body strength) abilities. To explore this question, participants engaged in five consecutive days of stone toolmaking and psychometric and motor testing. Each day consisted of 30 minutes of stone toolmaking practice, for a total of 2.5 hours across the five days, and a different psychometric or motor test. Participants were equipped with gloves and safety goggles of age-appropriate sizes and leather lap pads during stone toolmaking practice. Adult participants were awarded $70 at the completion of their five sessions ($10 per day plus a $20 completion bonus).

Pieces of all types were weighed and measured along their maximum linear dimensions (length, width, and thickness). Whole flakes were further measured along their technological dimensions, with respect to a landmark on the flake called the point of percussion, and the length, width, and exterior angle of their platforms were also recorded. In total, 8,898 detached pieces were weighed and measured. In addition to taking measurements on participants? detached pieces the research team also weighed and took the maximum linear dimensions of the cores from which the detached pieces were removed. Prior to data collection, the initial weights and maximum linear dimensions of the same cores were measured so that core shape and reduction intensity could be calculated at the experiment?s conclusion. For the psychometric and motor testing, all measures were scored and scaled, if necessary, and recorded in a central spreadsheet. All data were then analyzed with a series of statistical tests using SPSS software.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From this analysis, I identified three measures of stone toolmaking skill: reduction intensity of the cores, number of whole flakes produced, and the utility of the whole flakes produced, as determined by a previously calculated utility score. Between the two groups, adult participants more intensely reduced their cores and produced a greater number and more useful whole flakes than did children participants. Across the five days of data collection, all participants experienced a learning effect of core reduction intensity. Children also experienced a learning effect in the number of whole flakes produced. Neither group experienced a learning effect in the utility of whole flakes produced, meaning that the quality of whole flakes did not improve over the training period. With regard to the psychometric and motor testing results, participants? grip strength did positively correlate with their degree of core reduction intensity. Children who reported a higher Conscientiousness score in the Big Five Inventory (BFI) were also more likely to more completely reduce their cores.
