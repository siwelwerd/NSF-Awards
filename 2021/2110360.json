 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's \"Windows on the Universe\" Big Idea. The impact of the field of gravitational wave detection in recent years is difficult to overstate. Results from the Advanced LIGO detectors have regularly captured the imagination of the public, making headline news while providing vital new data to enable studies at the forefront of scientific knowledge. Regular detections of binary black hole systems have allowed scientists to compile a catalog of previously unknowable celestial objects. Precise measurements of the gravitational waveforms from the detected events allow us to probe the details of fundamental theories underpinning our understanding of the universe. The work supported by this award is directly aimed at improving the LIGO detector sensitivity in the future, as well as developing technology for and informing the design of the next generation of gravitational wave detectors. These goals will have a direct payoff in the form of continued discoveries and better science products. The USA has long been recognized as a leader in the field of gravitational wave astronomy. Continued research to push the boundaries of what is possible with gravitational wave detectors is necessary to maintain this position over the next decades. The majority of the work supported by this award will be performed by graduate students and undergraduate students, providing them with excellent training opportunities to develop their skills, therefore enriching the future American scientific workforce. The subject of the research is also a very fertile ground for outreach to the wider public, which is one of the best ways to broaden participation in science across society.\r\n\r\nThis award supports both simulation and experimental project components. The simulation component is aimed at characterizing the low frequency (<30Hz) noise of the Advanced LIGO interferometers, and using the knowledge gained to inform the design of future upgrades. Characterizing the low frequency detector noise is very challenging because it is a combination of many individual noise sources, and because even these individual noise sources are cross-coupled and difficult to model and estimate. However, new simulation tools are being developed that have the capability to untangle these noise contributions, and this project will apply these tools to tackle this problem. The same tools will also be used to support commissioning of the Advanced LIGO detectors in the lead up to the next two observing runs, both of which will include new hardware and configuration upgrades to the interferometers. The experimental component of this project includes the development of a new method for sensing misalignment and other optical imperfections in laser interferometers, which has some practical advantages over the currently used schemes. Detailed comparisons will be made between the different methods in tabletop laser interferometry experiments, in order to inform design choices for the gravitational wave detectors of the future. Also supported is a project to experimentally demonstrate the interferometric performance of new beam shapes (higher-order Hermite-Gauss modes), which have the potential to reduce the impact of one of the fundamental noise sources in laser interferometers: thermal noise.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

During this period the LIGO detectors received several major upgrades. Perhaps the most significant of these was the addition of frequency-dependent squeezed light, which uses careful manipulation of the quantum vacuum fluctuations to improve the detectors&rsquo; sensitivity to gravitational waves across the whole frequency band of interest.<br /><br />The installation of the new hardware for this upgrade was coordinated by the LIGO Laboratory, but also included the design, fabrication and delivery of ultra-low optical loss Faraday isolator components by the PI of this award&rsquo;s group. After the installation of new hardware always comes a period of fine tuning or &ldquo;commissioning&rdquo; of the interferometers, to first reach and then surpass previous performance metrics. This award supported work by graduate students to develop simulation models of the interferometers to better understand the details of the detector state, and to inform on-site commissioners in their decision making on how to adjust interferometer parameters to improve performance. Notably, this included a 3 month on-site visit to LIGO Livingston Observatory by a senior graduate student supported by this award. Simulating the observatories at the level of precision needed is an ongoing task, that is now carried forward in part by another graduate student who was supported by this award, and who plans to make a 3 month on-site visit to LIGO Hanford Observatory in Spring 2025.<br /><br />At the time of writing, LIGO&rsquo;s fourth observing run is underway, and other new technologies are being considered for upgrades both before and after the fifth observing run. The LIGO detectors are currently limited in their most sensitive frequency band by thermal motions of the molecules making up the mirrors that reflect the laser beams. The US-based research community is primarily pursuing advanced optical materials to improve this noise source for future detector upgrades. Work done under this project represents the only US-based research in an alternative direction: using different laser beam shapes to mitigate the thermal noise effect. This award supported graduate student Liu Tao in building an experimental testbed to generate higher-order Hermite-Gauss laser modes at high purity, which could be used to lower thermal noise in future LIGO upgrades. Liu published extensively on his research, elegantly showing how critical sensing signals in laser interferometers work with these modes, and performing precise measurements to confirm theoretical predictions. This potential upgrade technology is now far better understood in the context of LIGO than ever before.<br /><br />Another important noise source in Advanced LIGO arises from limitations in our ability to precisely sense and control the alignment of the interferometer mirrors. Graduate and undergraduate students working under this award performed experimental comparisons between a new technique to sense misalignment (previously developed by the PI's group) with the currently used quadrant photodetector-based approach. Specific noise couplings were investigated for both techniques, leading to a better understanding of potential improvements in the future with an augmented alignment sensing scheme. The concept behind the new technique was also extended to sense laser mode mismatches. Graduate student Raed Diab performed finite element modeling of fast-switchable electro-optic lens designs, and collaborated with a research group in Padova, Italy, on experimental demonstrations of this new technique. The new alignment sensing techniques developed here may help in the future to reduce detector noise at low frequencies, where more massive black hole signals dominate the signal spectrum. The new mode mismatch sensing technique may also further improve quantum noise limited sensitivity in future detectors, by improving the efficiency with which squeezed vacuum states couple into the interferometer.<br /><br />Aside from the contributions to Advanced LIGO detector science, the award has also had a significant impact on the STEM workforce. The award has supported a diverse range of young scientists: five undergraduate researchers, one of whom is already pursuing physics PhDs, and three of whom are applying for physics graduate school at the time of writing; three graduate students, one of whom recently graduated with his PhD and is now in a postdoctoral researcher position in the US, and one of whom targets graduation in Summer 2025.
