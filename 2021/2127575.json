 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strings are fundamental objects in many important computer science\r\napplications, such as text/speech processing, bioinformatics, data\r\nstorage and access, and communication systems. However, processing\r\nstrings presents various challenges in computation and communication.\r\nFor example, many of today's applications involving strings are\r\nimplemented on large data sets, and the known algorithms are often too\r\ncostly in both time and space. Similarly, when strings are transmitted\r\nbetween systems, errors like insertions and deletions occur frequently,\r\nwhich can lead to problems from a simple misunderstanding to a severe\r\nsystem failure. These challenges are usually addressed by high cost\r\nsolutions, where one either requires a large amount of resources for the\r\nalgorithms, or expensive hardware that keeps systems strictly\r\nsynchronized. The overarching goal of this project is to understand the\r\nfundamental question of how to more efficiently compute different\r\nstring measures, and transmit strings reliably in the presence of\r\ninsertions and deletions. This will lead to a deeper theoretical\r\nunderstanding of the nature of various string measures and errors, as\r\nwell as potentially much more efficient solutions in practice. Examples\r\nof benefits include algorithms that use much less resources for handling\r\nlarge data sets, and more reliable communication systems in adversarial\r\nenvironments. The project also has plans for mentoring PhD students,\r\nintegration of the research topics into courses taught to students from\r\na variety of different backgrounds, and support of under-represented\r\ngroups of students in computer science.\r\n\r\nThe project contains two sets of specific goals. The first set of goals\r\nseeks to understand how to design efficient error-correcting codes for\r\ninsertions and deletions. These include codes and document-exchange\r\nprotocols over the binary alphabet with asymptotically optimal\r\nparameters; codes that form a linear subspace or have a low density\r\nparity check matrix, which allow fast encoding and decoding; list\r\ndecodable codes that can correct a larger fraction of errors with\r\noutputting a small list of possibly correct messages; and locally\r\ndecodable codes that can correctly recover any target message bit with\r\nonly a few queries of the codeword. The second set of goals investigates\r\nthe space complexity of various string measures, such as edit distance,\r\nlongest common subsequence, and longest increasing subsequence.\r\nSpecifically, the goal is to both design algorithms that require much\r\nsmaller space to compute or approximate these string measures, and to\r\nprove better space lower bounds in various models. These two sets of\r\ngoals are also naturally connected, since the codes in the first part\r\ncan often be used to give space lower bounds in the second part. The\r\nstudy of these topics will be based on techniques from several different\r\nareas such as probability theory, information theory, combinatorics,\r\nalgorithm design, communication complexity, and pseudorandomness, and\r\nwill further foster the interactions among these areas towards\r\nbreakthroughs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
