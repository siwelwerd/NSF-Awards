 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Missouri State University at Springfield is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs to improve research by Dr. Tiglet Besara and colleagues Nikolay Gerasimchuk, Gary Michelfelder, Fei Wang and Natasha DeVore. The institution is acquiring a single crystal diffractometer difffractometer (SCXRD). In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, geology and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution as well other departments such as Physics, Astronomy, Materials Science, Geography, Geology and Planning. The instrumentation provides direct research experience for students in a variety of courses distributed in various departments. The institution serves as a hub for materials characterization and provides crystallography services free of charge to nearby institutions such as University of Missouri-Kansas City, Missouri University of Science and Technology, University of Arkansas and the University of Central Arkansas.\r\n\r\nThe award of the X-ray diffractometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The science enabled by this instrument provides relevant societal benefits through the development of new materials to address energy production, new catalysts to improve the synthesis of commodity and industrial chemicals. The instrumentation is also used for studying the growth of functional and quantum materials and exploring and developing intermetallic materials for energy related applications. In addition, it benefits structural biology studies of heme orphan cytochrome P450 and peroxidase proteins and the characterization of synthesized oxime-based ligands and their metal complexes for possible biomedical applications. The diffractometer is also used to characterize minerals and volcanic materials, and halogen and hydrogen bonding in carbon-hydrogen compounds to manipulate arylene ethynylene structures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
