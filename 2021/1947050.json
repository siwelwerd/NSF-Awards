 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current power grid faces the long-term challenge of efficiently integrating renewables and distributed energy resources (DERs) due to demand inflexibility, legacy grid operations, and uncertainties caused by human behavior. This challenge becomes more acute as energy generation becomes \u2018greener\u2019 and more distributed, and as electric vehicles proliferate. The Distributed Energy Resources Connect (DERConnect) infrastructure project envisions a unique open-access and remote access national testbed facility that will accelerate the development of methods and tools that incorporate real-time data analytics, machine learning, and distributed control algorithms into future grid architectures under dynamic conditions. DERConnect represents a first-of-its-kind complete integrated grid system, enabling the exploration of joint optimization of grid operations and communications infrastructure in both normal and adversarial operating conditions. The project aligns well with the nation's high-priority goals of clean and efficient energy.\r\n\r\nAs noted in 2017 and 2019 National Renewable Energy Laboratory workshops, the major limitation in developing new power grid technologies is the lack of large-scale environments to test and validate effective control algorithms. The DERConnect testbed being created in this project will integrate a combination of DERs, including photovoltaics, battery energy storage, electric vehicles, hardware emulators (to emulate solar and wind energy sources), and controllable building subsystems such as lighting and heating, ventilation and air conditioning  subsystems using a combination of simulation, emulation, and physical hardware. The DERConnect will permit researchers to explore innovative distributed control algorithms and tools for complex, accessible, and trustworthy cyber-physical systems, and to study the interplay between humans, technology, access to information and incentives.  The infrastructure facility addresses a high national need and offers stakeholders the ability to conduct research on the control and operation of multiple and diverse DERs in a realistic and cyber-secured environment. \r\n\r\nThe DERConnect facility will be a platform for new opportunities to train and develop the next generation of students, teachers, and workforce critical for the successful modernization of the U.S. power grid. By leveraging University of California, San Diego education programs, the DERConnect team will implement extensive education and outreach activities for K-12 students and teachers, and partner with local STEM programs such as the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science, called COSMOS, and the Santa Fe Community College. The DERConnect project is an ideal training basis for microgrid design and construction with unparalleled benefits to the California Native American tribes who rely on microgrid infrastructures for energy security.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
