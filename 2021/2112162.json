 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce cost and environmental impact associated with Portland cement, the most common general-purpose cement.  A new process for making Portland cement has not been introduced in nearly 100 years, and its production accounts for for 5.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with 60% from the rock and the remainder from the fuel used in the process. This project proposes a different process that can reduce emissions. \r\n\r\nCurrently cement is made via the thermal decomposition of limestone to produce lime and CO2. This project advances a technology based on selective extraction of calcium from non-carbonate rocks for conversion into cement. The process also produces amorphous silica as a byproduct. Because calcium is not associated with carbonate, the emissions associated with manufacturing process are reduced.  This  research will be focused on thermal decomposition of the calcium-bearing compound in the process stream to make calcium silicates as a basis for the cement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
