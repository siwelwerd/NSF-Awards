 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project stems from the development of an efficient broad-spectrum antiviral agent addressing the current COVID-19 pandemic. The approach can also address future outbreaks of other viruses. The project is targeting the group of COVID-19 patients who will develop severe illness featuring multiple organ dysfunction.  Those patients need ICU units and ventilators in amounts that can overwhelm the health care system. This project will develop an antiviral agent to mitigate the social distancing measures and improve quality of life. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the development AK-423, a potential efficient antiviral and immunomodulatory agent against COVID-19. The technical objectives focus on testing AK-423 (in-vitro and in-vivo) against COVID-19. Recent reports suggest that the multi-organ damage that occurs during COVID-19 infection is characterized by an exaggerated inflammatory response indicative of cytokine storm, auto-immunity, and a sepsis syndrome caused by complex abnormal immune reactions. An ideal treatment would not only suppress viral replication but would also regulate the abnormal immune response. AK-423 targets a host metabolic process that the virus hijacks. It is also a key process in the differentiation of lymphocytes. Inhibition of such process is proven to dampen the immune response, minimize immune response-induced tissue damage, inhibit production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and efficiently shut down viral replication. This strategy will deliver an efficient broad-spectrum antiviral agent.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

COVID-19 infections are characterized by hyperinflammation and autoimmunity leading to multi-organ damage (lungs, heart, blood vessels, brain) even with a mild infection. The damage is cumulative as it gets worse with every new infection, and repeat infections increase the risk of Long COVID (persistent symptoms that last for months after infections).

An ideal treatment would not only suppress viral replication but would also restore the immune system homeostasis and healthy immune response. In Phase I, Akanocure tackled the dysregulated immune response through designing and testing AK-423 as an efficient immunomodulatory agent to prevent immune-mediated organ damage. AK-423 was tested for the reduction of key cytokines/chemokines that are markers for disease severity and fatality and are implicated in the persistence of inflammation, organ damage, lung fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and cardiovascular complications. In addition, these chemokines/cytokines recruit immune suppressive cells (monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs)) that decrease the effectiveness of vaccines and disrupt the host?s proper antiviral responses by the immune system.
