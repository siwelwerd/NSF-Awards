 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact /commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development a safe way to reduce aflatoxin contamination in food. Aflatoxin contamination is a risk to human and livestock health. The World Health Organization estimates that 25 percent or more of the world\u2019s crops are destroyed by aflatoxin contamination annually. The proposed technology would support food security, help to reduce hunger worldwide, and improve quality of life by providing increased quantities of safe food. The technology would allow for crops to not be wasted, enabling economic benefits. In addition, this environmentally friendly method has the potential to reduce or replace fungicide and pesticide use, further benefitting the environment.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of nanotechnology that has been shown to significantly reduce fungal aflatoxin biosynthesis and excretion, using very low concentrations of manufactured silver nanoparticles (NPs). Research has shown that the reduced toxin production is not due to the silver ion but rather by transcriptome-level changes in the fungi based on reduced production of reactive oxygen species after exposure to the NP. Nano-fungal interactions also may be regulated based on the optimization of NP physico-chemical properties, and both size and coating of the NPs have been shown to have a significant effect. This regulation may allow for silver NPs to inhibit aflatoxin production by fungi responsible for grain, fruit and vegetable spoilage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The fundamental research was designed to produce nanomaterials which have a low environmental footprint and to understand their environmental fate and behavior. The nanoparticles produced have a low energy input, have low hazard reactants, are low toxicity, have controllable exposure and therefore have low risk. The nanoparticles are also reusable or produce waste materials which can be reused. In this project, we performed a large number of customer discovery interviews, within a lean start-up approach, in order to identify and validate business-related value propositions and customers segment, and a scalable business model. Our initial hypothesis was that there would be a viable value proposition and customer segment in the area of grain storage from fungal disease using antifungal silver nanoparticles. This hypothesis was rejected rapidly as there was a lack of interest in the relevant business ecosystem, and suitable pivots were made. Two other hypotheses were set up and tested in the agricultural and environmental areas and were shown to be potentially viable as business models. These two areas are currently under investigation: we will reduce technical risk and bring closer to market, via applications to the federal system for commercialization (SBIR). In addition, we developed a quantitative statistical method to analyze customer discovery interview data. This was designed to work alongside and help standard qualitative interpretation methods. There are two manuscripts submitted or in preparation from this work, detailing this approach and we have shown it to be an important addition to understanding the business implications of interview data.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/31/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jamie&nbsp;Lead</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
