 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific evidence shows that Earth\u2019s climate is rapidly changing. Understanding how ecosystems respond to climate change will provide critical information to help human populations adjust to these changes. This study will examine how ancient mammal communities responded to an episode of global warming about fifty-three million years ago. Data about diet, locomotor activity, and body size will be gathered from fossils in U.S. museums to reconstruct the ecosystems in which these mammals lived. Chemical signatures from fossil teeth will be used to interpret ancient environments. Assessing how these communities responded to habitat change through this interval of warming climate will provide useful data for understanding how modern ecosystems may respond to future warming. This project will include collaboration with communities that have been historically underrepresented in the sciences by providing sets of books about climate change and the fossil record to libraries in Native American and rural communities. The project also includes development of a year-long course for underserved high school students and professional development for New York City public school teachers.\r\n\r\nThis research will focus on warming at the onset of the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum when average temperatures increased by about 5\u00b0C over an interval of 200,000 to 300,000 years. Paleoenvironments will be reconstructed by developing a model using stable carbon isotopes in mammal teeth. Paleoecological interpretations will be made with morphometric analyses based in part on digitized scans of bones and teeth. Fossils will be sourced from two Wyoming basins (Wind River and Bighorn) to test for geographic differences in paleoecology and paleoenvironments. Changes in paleoecology and mammalian community structure will be analyzed with quantitative methods, and compared to ecological changes during an earlier interval of warming climate at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary. This will provide a test of whether mammalian response to climate occurred in a consistent, repeatable fashion. Project outreach includes collaborations with libraries in Tribal and rural communities, providing books and materials on climate change. It also includes a course for urban high school students and professional development for science teachers. All outreach components are based on research on effective practices, and incorporate formative evaluative feedback.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Therefore, it is critical to understand the ways ecosystems might respond to climate change. This study examined how ancient mammalian communities responded to an episode of global warming known as the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) that occurred about 53 million years ago. At this time, average temperatures increased by around 5 degrees Celsius over an interval of 200,000-300,000 years. This project was undertaken as a collaborative effort between five principal investigators. My part was to increase the number of fossils known from just before and during the EECO in the Bighorn Basin of northwestern Wyoming. This basin is famous for its remarkably dense and nearly complete record of fossil mammals from the early Eocene epoch (56-52 million years ago). However, it peters out in the uppermost levels just prior to the onset of the EECO; the sparse fossils from this interval come from outcrops that are remote, steep and difficult to access. I directed two short summer field seasons in the Bighorn Basin exploring and collecting fossils from these challenging outcrops and my crews discovered almost 850 new fossil mammal specimens from before and through the onset of the EECO. These new specimens increased existing sample sizes by about 10%, including some rare species and some unusually well-preserved specimens that greatly enhance our understanding of this important interval. With my collaborators, we analyzed chemical signatures in the fossil teeth to interpret ancient environments. Also with my collaborators, we gathered data about diet, locomotor activity, and body size from the new specimens as well as those already in U.S. museums to reconstruct the communities in which these mammals lived. Patterns of climatic, environmental and ecological change in the Bighorn Basin were compared with similarly derived patterns from the Wind River Basin, a neighboring basin in Wyoming that also documents the EECO. Our preliminary results show that the Bighorn Basin transitioned from open forests before the EECO to drier, more open habitats during the EECO, whereas the Wind River Basin was consistently drier and did not change significantly during the EECO. Our preliminary results also show that primate community composition differed between the two basins and changed across the EECO, presumably in response to climatic and environmental change. The dataset developed for this project will continue to provide useful metrics for understanding how ecosystems may respond to future warming. This project also impacted communities underrepresented in the sciences by distributing accessible books about climate change and the fossil record to libraries in Native American and other rural communities.
