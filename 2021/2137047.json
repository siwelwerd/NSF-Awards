 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Eighth International Conference on Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of Populations in Biological Systems (ICMA-VIII) will be held at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, on March 25-27, 2022.  Research in mathematical biology investigates the principles that govern the structure, development, or behavior of biological systems. It can be used to test hypotheses and help make informed decisions to address issues such as epidemic spread, tumor growth and treatment, agricultural pests, and invasive or endangered species. The main objectives of this conference are to facilitate the exchange of novel research developments and ideas, to promote the development of new collaborations and enhance existing collaborations, and to provide opportunities for early career researchers and students to interact with internationally renowned scientists. This conference series brings together a diverse range of participants from a wide variety of backgrounds, including various career levels, ranks, and underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe broad, general theme of the conference is the formulation, validation, analysis, and simulation of mathematical models for gaining insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of biological populations. A special emphasis at this eighth conference will be on multiple scale dynamics in ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology. Specific topics include, but are not limited to, immune epidemiological and vector-host systems, molecular-cellular modeling in systems biology and oncology, biological invasions and persistence, adaptation and evolutionary dynamics, and biological systems operating on multiple spatial or temporal scales. The plenary speakers at this conference are encouraged to reach out to a broader audience, to give surveys of the current state of the research in their field of study, and to suggest new directions of research. The Journal of Biological Dynamics will publish a special issue of papers authored by speakers and participants at ICMA-VIII, making the advancements presented at this conference available to a broader audience. More information about this conference can be found at https://userweb.ucs.louisiana.edu/~C00424602/ICMA2022/index.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
