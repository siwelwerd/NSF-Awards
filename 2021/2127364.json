 "awd_abstract_narration": "Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) is one of NSF\u2019s 10 Big Ideas. NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. This Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhances efforts in formal and informal education, and integrates the co-production of knowledge where appropriate. This award fulfills part of that aim by addressing interactions among social systems, natural environment, and built environment in the following NNA focus areas: Arctic Residents, Data and Observation, Education, Global Impact, and Resilient Infrastructure. \r\n\r\nArctic cities face multiple challenges from social and economic transformations, deteriorating infrastructure, a changing environment, and pressures on their governance systems. To respond effectively, mayors, city councils, agency leaders, local citizens and residents, and other stakeholders need a clear set of indicators to help them understand changes in Arctic conditions and provide guidance in devising infrastructure and governance strategies to achieve future prosperity and spur sustainability. This NNA Collaboratory project assesses numerous issues of urban sustainability and compiles a set of metrics on Arctic conditions that provides data about changes in several issues, including the natural environment, energy, and socio-cultural issues. With these indicators, policymakers and stakeholders can develop effective governance systems and design and build infrastructure to meet the challenges of a shifting natural environment and economy in Arctic urban areas. \r\n\r\nThis NNA Collaboratory expands upon a database of indicators on various topics in numerous cities on natural conditions in the Arctic. The Collaboratory cultivates theories and test hypotheses in the natural, social, and urban planning sciences by developing new indicators for Arctic conditions that include historical data, enabling examination of dynamic trends and relationships among the various components of urban sustainability. The Collaboratory advances a long-term research agenda and platform around Arctic urban sustainability by organizing collaborations among the Arctic research community and facilitating convergence research on the natural, social, and built environment transitions taking place in and around Arctic cities now and in the future. Indicators introduce a shared vocabulary with explicit measures and assumptions that allow scholars and others across disciplines to interact while providing a foundation for theory building and testing. Working with Indigenous and other communities, the Collaboratory also engages in case studies of divergent Arctic urban areas to examine city-level data for interlinkages among assorted elements of sustainability. Consequently, this NNA Collaboratory improves the ability of policymakers and stakeholders to promote sustainability by providing tools to measure progress, identify areas of most urgent need, select verifiable best practices, examine opportunity costs, and determine where external actors can have the greatest impact.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the NNA Program and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
