 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Cellular Agriculture and Cultured Meat (CACM) aims to address the world\u2019s growing need for high quality proteins that are nutritious, delicious, affordable, safe, sustainable, and ethical. Rising meat demand, juxtaposed with increasing concern over climate change and environmental degradation, highlights the need for alternative methods of producing conventional animal products. Cell culture, fermentation, and food science offer powerful tools for developing these alternatives. Specifically, by producing animal products such as meat and dairy through cell culture\u2014rather than from whole animals, it is possible to decouple the animal products that consumers demand from the negative externalities of intensive animal agriculture. Such a production paradigm (termed \u201cCellular Agriculture\u201d) could improve our food system\u2019s resilience, sustainability, health, safety and accessibility. The CACM is focused on combining the strengths, capacity, and resources of academia and industry to tackle some of the biggest problems facing the sustainable and scalable production of cellular agriculture products. The Center will explore topics ranging from raw material inputs for production, process designs to maximize efficiency, product quality metrics including nutrition and sensory experience, food safety, environmental impacts, production economics, and consumer desirability. Specific research thrusts will be determined with input from a range of industry stakeholders and will address the most pressing research areas for advancing the field. Additionally, the Center will pursue activities to draw in talent to this rapidly growing and highly interdisciplinary industry, building a workforce which encompasses workers from STEM (e.g., biology, chemical engineering, and food science), agriculture (e.g., chefs, farmers, and economists), and policy (e.g., food policy, food safety, and consumer interest). Through these activities, the CACM will foster this growing field towards a food system that is sustainable, healthy, and attractive.\r\n\r\nThe CACM will focus on three main research thrusts: 1) advancing technologies for cellular agriculture production, 3) advancing the quality of cellular agriculture products, and 3) advancing our understanding of cellular agriculture products. The first of these will focus on developing enabling technologies that can be used to lower the cost and improve the scale of production. The approaches will include bioengineering (e.g., developing tissue scaffolds for meat products), chemical engineering (e.g., developing bioreactors for producing meat, milk, and other products through cell culture), food science (e.g., processing plant-based inputs for culture systems or cellular agriculture products), and cell biology (e.g., developing cell lines or media for large scale culture). The second research thrust will focus on enhancing the quality of cellular agriculture products. Approaches here will include cell engineering, nutrition and sensory evaluation and food processing/science. Finally, the third thrust will focus on understanding the environmental, health, and societal impacts of cellular agriculture products. Approaches will include life-cycle and techno-economic assessment, nutrition evaluation, food-safety evaluation, and consumer acceptance studies. Together, these thrusts will converge to accelerate the development of cellular agriculture as an accessible, sustainable, equitable, and desirable food production system. The CACM is centered at Tufts University, which is home to the largest academic cultured meat research lab in the US, as well as the Friedman School of Nutrition. The resources of the school of Arts Science and Engineering (biomedical and chemical engineering facilities, expertise, and workforce) combined with those of the Friedman School (nutrition evaluation facilities, expertise, workforce, and the USDA\u2019s Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging), as well as the position of Boston, MA as a hub for life-science research, combine to equip the CACM as a leader in collaborative research for advancing cellular agriculture and cultured meat development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
