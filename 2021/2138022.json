 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Green Bank Observatory will organize and host a community workshop on research experiences for high school students in disciplines supported by NSF\u2019s Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS). The workshop is intended as a forum for sharing, gathering community input, and illuminating best practices in providing research experiences to high school students and organizing such research activities across universities, labs, and observatories. The input gathered from the workshop can be used to inform the NSF Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate in considering how best to support K-12 research activities through future targeted programs. \r\n\r\nIt is often stated that solving the global challenges presented by the 21st century requires a United States workforce with training in STEM fields, and that the STEM workforce may be insufficient to fill that need. Education research literature in STEM suggests that engaging students early and often in authentic research experiences enhances STEM identity, STEM self-efficacy, and STEM career interest: three personal attributes that are linked to entry into and persistence on a STEM career pathway. Much of this literature is focused on college students, however. This workshop will convene people and organizations who have designed and implemented research experiences for high school students, and who will examine the role such experiences can play in the development of a student\u2019s interest and STEM identity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
