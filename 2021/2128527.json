 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semidefinite and polynomial optimization (SDO and PO) are topics of great theoretical and\r\npractical interest, with numerous applications in theoretical computer science, control theory,\r\nquantum information sciences, and statistics. The steady advances in efficient interior-point\r\nmethods (IPMs) lends credence to the impactful role of SDO, as an emerging computational\r\ntool, in PO and quantum computing. The complexity of SDO and PO is well-known in the\r\nbit model of computation: there is no polynomial-time algorithm yet to find an exact optimal\r\nsolution of these classes of optimization problems. However, even for an approximate solution,\r\nthere are pathological instances that IPMs or relaxation hierarchies for PO fail to solve.\r\nIn view of this challenge, the need to investigate the complexity through a broader spectrum\r\nof complexity measures is obvious. Such a novel approach allows for a finer classification of\r\ninstances with high complexity. This project pursues the above goal by addressing several\r\nkey questions on the complexity of SDO and PO, through the lens of real algebraic geometry.\r\nThe results of this project will enhance understanding of the complexity in SDO and PO\r\nand have the potential to impact other disciplines, including quantum information sciences,\r\nwhere the emerging area of quantum IPMs with their unique advantages offer unprecedented\r\nintellectual challenges. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of this project, the investigators will\r\ntrain graduate students and organize meetings by inviting experts as well as young researchers\r\nfor fruitful interaction amongst the optimization and real algebraic geometry communities.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the project focuses on quantitative and algorithmic questions about the complexity\r\nof SDO from the perspective of the central path. Since IPMs operate in a neighborhood\r\nof the central path, their efficiency is influenced by the analytic and algebro-geometric properties\r\nof the central path. The investigators explore several complexity measures based on the\r\ndegree, worst-case convergence rate, and geometric curvature of the central path for regular\r\nand near to ill-posed instances. By means of these complexity measures, in particular, one\r\ncan quantitatively justify the complexity of IPMs on instances whose special structures exhibit\r\nfailure of the strict complementarity condition. The second part of the project investigates the\r\ncomplexity of PO through error bounds and the topology of the feasible set. Unlike IPMs, the\r\nmoment/sum of squares approach only deals with a sequence of objective values (rather than\r\nsolutions), which may not adequately reflect the progress toward the optimal set. As a result,\r\nthe current complexity bounds from the moment/sum of squares approach are purely algebraic\r\nwith no reliance on the topology/geometry of the feasible set. The investigators will explore\r\ntopology based complexity measures which allow for the inclusion of the Betti numbers of the\r\nfeasible set and thus enhance PO solvers with more precise complexity estimates. That will\r\nrigorously explain why iterative algorithms are more likely to stop at a local optima of a PO\r\nproblem, as the number of connected components or the holes in the feasible set increases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
