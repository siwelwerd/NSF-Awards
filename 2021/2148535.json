 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most pressing problems in understanding Earth?s climate is solar irradiance: the amount of light emitted by the Sun. Solar irradiance is the sole source of heating on Earth. If we want to understand our climate, we must understand the source of the sunlight that warms our planet. The proposed work will examine two different high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic models of the Sun in an effort to understand how magnetic variability at small scales (down to tens of kilometers) can affect irradiance. The team will compare the results of the two different models to high-resolution measurements of the Sun from the NSF?s Dunn Solar Telescope and from NASA?s Solar Dynamics Observatory. The result of this work will be a greater understanding of solar irradiance variability, which will lead to a better understanding of the external influences on the Earth?s climate. This work will form the basis of a graduate student?s PhD thesis.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work is to examine the results of two different three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar photosphere for solar irradiance at small (~10 km) scales. Simulated spectra will be generated by BAERI?s StellarBox code and from NCAR/HAO?s MURaM code and compared to observations of the Sun from the Dunn Solar Telescope and from the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft. The team will assess the contribution to solar irradiance in certain spectral ranges from magnetic features too small to be resolved in moderate-resolution imaging. They will also examine the effects of different numerical schemes and approximations used in the two different MHD codes to predicted overall irradiance. The overall objective will be to identify the most suitable numerical contributions for advancing irradiance reconstruction and stellar atmosphere models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Within this project, we addressed this question from both the observational and modeling perspectives. From the modeling side, we used the ab-initio realistic simulations of the quiet Sun in a box (called StellarBox) and modeled how the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI) telescope would see the modeled Sun in the box, both with the telescope's original and computational resolutions. This helped us to find the correspondence between the remote sensing SDO/HMI observations and the actual properties of the solar plasma (such as magnetic fields and velocities), as well as investigate the impact of the spatial resolution on the relations between them. From the observational side, we have routinely analyzed 12 years of quiet Sun data obtained by SDO/HMI, and concluded that the small-scale magnetic elements are more likely contributed by the local dynamo mechanism with respect to global dynamo (entire Sun-wide) processes. The project also supported additional research activities, such as investigation of application of novel deep learning techniques to the compression of the spectroscopic data and investigation of how SDO/HMI would see the kernels of 'sunquakes' potentially ignited by the proton beams in solar flares.</p>\n<p><br />In more detail, our specific research activities were the following:<br />1. We mimicked the SDO/HMI line-of-sight (LoS) pipeline, applied it to the computed synthetic Stokes profiles of Fe I 6173 &Aring; spectral line obtained for the StellarBox quiet-Sun simulations and RADYN flare heating simulations, and analyzed the relations between the observables and the physical properties of the atmosphere (such as magnetic field strengths, Doppler velocities, and temperature/pressure enhancements due to flare heating). This analysis enhances the interpretation of the SDO/HMI measurements, as well as helps to understand the effects of the special resolution on the observables. Figure 1 shows what heights the SDO/HMI LOS observables correspond to at the high and intrumental resolutions, as well as highlights the center-to-limb effect for SDO/HMI observations.<br />2. Systematic analysis of SDO/HMI unresolved brightness contributions. We have rewritten the code for the estimation of the brightness contribution of unresolved magnetic elements presented in Schnerr and Spruit (2011) and routinely applied it to SDO/HMI disk-center data during the 2010-2022 time period. We are not observing any statistically significant variation of the fitting parameters over the solar cycle, which supports the hypothesis of the dominant contribution by the local dynamo process for the generation of the small-scale magnetic elements. Figure 2 shows that the changes of the unresolved brightness model parameters with time do not show solar cycle dependence, supporting a local dynamo hypothesis.<br />3. Understanding of the impact of LTE and NLTE conditions on the line profile shapes. We have compared the Fe I 6173 A and Fe I 6301 A &amp; 6302 A line profiles computed under LTE and NLTE (statistical equilibrium) assumptions using RH1.5D and Lightweaver radiative transfer codes for the different features of the quiet Sun (centers of the granules, intergranular lanes with weak and strong magnetic field concentrations, etc.)<br />4.
