 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research project brings together four University of California (UC) campuses: Irvine, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz \u2013 all of which are Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) or emerging HSIs - with the goal of developing, implementing, self-studying, evaluating, and disseminating an AGEP Alliance Model about increasing the number of Latinx teaching-focused STEM faculty.  The AGEP Alliance partners will employ a collective impact framework to ensure there is a common AGEP Alliance agenda, to share measures across the partner institutions, to implement mutually reinforcing activities and interventions, to facilitate continuous communication, and to engage with the backbone organization (UC San Diego) that supports AGEP Alliance activities, interventions and communication.  The Latinx teaching-focused faculty who are proposed to be hired in Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences, as well as Engineering departments, will vary depending on each campus\u2019s social and academic context, and fiscal status.  In addition to supporting STEM faculty fellows as agents to improve hiring practices and department climate, the AGEP Alliance will create and implement objective rubrics for both the teaching faculty search processes and for evaluation of candidates\u2019 teaching skills.\r\n\r\nAs the nation addresses a STEM achievement gap between racial and ethnic minority and non-minority undergraduate and graduate students, our universities and colleges struggle to recruit, retain and promote a diverse cohort of STEM faculty to serve as role models and academic leaders for students to learn from, work with and emulate. Recent NSF reports indicate that racial and ethnic minority STEM associate and full professors occupy only about 8% of these senior faculty positions at all 4-year colleges and universities, and only about 6% of these positions at the nation's most research-intensive institutions. This AGEP Alliance Model has the potential to improve the success of Latinx STEM scholars transitioning into early-career faculty positions, and early-career faculty advancing to promotion and/or tenure, in Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences, as well as Engineering.  Advancing the careers of Latinx faculty ultimately leads to improved academic mentorship for undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars, in STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe AGEP Alliance\u2019s integrated research study will examine how early career Latinx STEM faculty in teaching-focused roles experience the transition into the faculty positions.  A national sample will be investigated using narrative inquiry methods. One evaluator will conduct the formative evaluation of the AGEP Alliance and a different independent evaluator will manage the summative project assessment.  There were also be independent evaluation team to conduct formative and summative project evaluation.  Additionally, the AGEP Alliance will consult regularly with an advisory board and an institutional leadership council, to garner input for self-study and continuous project improvement.  Finally, the dissemination plan includes a structure to share the Alliance work locally and to present the project at national professional and disciplinary meetings; and peer-reviewed publications are also planned.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
