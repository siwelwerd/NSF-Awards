The CMMRC is a multidisciplinary group, with membership drawn from universities, industry, and government laboratories.  It provides expertise to the National Academies and support for the condensed matter and materials research communities. Among the activities that the CMMRC engages in are the organizing of topical workshops on frontier areas of materials/condensed matter research, and the preparation and distribution of written summaries of those proceedings.  Through its semi-annual meetings and community outreach, the CMMRC provides opportunities for meaningful engagement among members of the community and the agencies that support research in these fields. Finally, it participates in the development of National Academies\u2019 projects that are of benefit to the condensed matter and materials research communities, and assists in providing long-term stewardship of National Academies\u2019 reports that impact these fields, including the materials research decadal survey. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract: \r\nThis project provides partial, 3-year support for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine\u2019s (\u201cNational Academies\u201d) Condensed Matter and Materials Research Committee (CMMRC).  The CMMRC is a multidisciplinary group with membership drawn from universities, industry, and government laboratories. The areas of expertise represented on the committee are intended to cover the breadth of the condensed matter and materials research fields. \r\nCMMRC\u2019s roles within the condensed matter and materials research communities are to serve as a conduit for interactions between these communities and the federal government, including the agencies that support this research, and to monitor the health of and important new developments in these fields.  Among the mechanisms that CMMRC has used and proposes to continue to use to fulfill its charge are (1) working with sponsoring agencies to initiate and oversee annual workshops that focus on frontier areas of research, and drafting workshop proceedings that summarize the presentations and ensuing discussions; (2) working within the National Academies to develop other special forums such as meetings of experts, and report-generating studies that relate to condensed matter and materials research, where needed; (3) conducting two face-to-face meetings each year that permit engagement among members of the condensed matter and materials research communities and representatives of agencies that support these fields; (4) providing long-term stewardship of reports that CMMRC helped to develop and/or that impact the condensed matter and materials research communities; (5) interacting with the professional societies and FACA committees for condensed matter and materials research; and (6) serving as a resource and providing expert advice to other standing committees and boards in the development of National Academies\u2019 activities that impact the condensed matter and materials research fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
