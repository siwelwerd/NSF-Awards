 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum technologies, similar to their classical counterparts, will be built by combining modules containing quantum processors, memory units, and optical links for long-distance communication. When networked over long distances, these modules will enable applications including long-distance secure communication, distributed quantum computing, and secure access to cloud quantum computers in a way that guarantees complete privacy to the user. A critical missing ingredient for the realization of such a \u2018quantum internet\u2019 is units that can convert quantum information between such modules. This project develops interconnects between leading solid-state quantum computing and memory platforms based on superconducting circuits and atom-like defects in solids. It advances microfabricated electrical, acoustic, and optical devices to enable quantum state conversion between superconducting quantum processors and single-atom memories in silicon. By using microfabricated silicon devices, this approach could lead to the adoption of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques in quantum technologies and interconnects. In addition to the research, the PIs are training students and increasing participation in the emerging field of quantum engineering by developing new K-12 outreach modules on quantum networks, supporting undergraduate research positions, and establishing new graduate courses.  \r\n\r\nThis project develops building blocks for a quantum network architecture combining superconducting quantum processor end nodes and color-center quantum repeater nodes operating at higher temperatures. Superconducting circuits, while frontrunners as quantum processors, lack an optical interface and have to operate at ultralow temperatures. This makes them a scarce resource in a large-scale quantum network. This project develops modular microwave-to-optical quantum transducers to interconnect superconducting circuits with optical photons and color center qubits in silicon. It integrates recently discovered color center qubits in silicon into silicon photonic devices to develop practical repeater nodes that can operate at higher temperatures. The microwave-to-optical quantum transducers and the quantum emitters are both developed on an integrated electro-opto-mechanical device platform based on silicon-on-insulator. The PIs are using this integrated device platform to investigate on-chip and off-chip methods of entanglement generation between superconducting qubits and color center qubits via indistinguishable photon detection and coherent single phonon exchange, and optimizing protocols for such a heterogeneous quantum network. This approach builds on silicon devices, the ideal material platform for fabricating electronic and photonic devices at scale, to interconnect leading solid-state qubit platforms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
