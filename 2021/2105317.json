 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. Under the sponsorship of Dr. Kim Fortun at the University of California, Irvine, this postdoctoral fellowship award supports an early career scientist\u2019s investigation of the effects of air pollution on youth sports coaching practices and pedagogical development. Exposure to air pollution during childhood has significant destructive effects on health and well-being, both short and long-term. K\u201312 students in marginalized communities often suffer disproportionally from exposure to airborne hazards. School staff members, especially sports coaches, are well positioned to mitigate children\u2019s exposure to air pollution through their decisions of when, where, and how to exercise. Yet most coaches are inadequately prepared to address such environmental hazards. This project helps education policymakers and curriculum development professionals dramatically improve their accounting of situated environmental hazards in diverse school settings by giving them access to real-time data. In particular, it focuses on providing working class, minority, and immigrant communities with such data. For while such communities are often the subject of pollution-related research, they are seldom invited to give input during basic data collection\u2014even though they are particularly well positioned and stand to benefit the most. This project develops a new line of research that theorizes coaches as air pollution actors in their everyday activities. Such innovation is possible by using participatory action research design elements and leading community-engaged, environmental justice-oriented research approaches.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project, \u201cYouth Sports Coaches and their Community in Air Pollution Governance,\u201d will study the daily decision making and pedagogical choices of school sports coaches at a local public school, and its surrounding neighborhood, in the San Gabriel Valley, California, a region with significant air pollution given its proximity to numerous major highways. The project objectives are (1) to collect, organize, and map empirical data on pollution research and governance; (2) to collect interview data from stakeholders; (3) to collect air pollution data through monitoring devices; (4) to develop a multi-scalar theoretical framework to characterize pollution governance; (5) to develop a freeway and transportation corridor archive. The study will employ emerging Urban Humanities methods, ethnographic observations, interviews, archival research, and air quality monitoring data to produce original data sets finely attuned to localized experiences of school coaches. Stakeholder coaches will wear, and neighbors will install, air pollution monitoring devices, and will learn how to access and understand the generated data via smartphone applications. Outcomes include developing maps and other visualizations of the daily activities of coaches on school grounds, situating their pedagogic decisions vis-\u00e0-vis the pollution governance infrastructures of school, city, and state. A broader impact of this project is the development of guides for sports coaches and community stakeholders to understand and communicate effectively about air pollution hazards.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

K-12 students in marginalized communities are particularly vulnerable because of their disproportionate exposure to air pollution both at home and school. School staff members, especially coaches, are well positioned to help mitigate children's exposure to air pollution through the way they schedule, locate and run sports activities. Most coaches, however, are inadequately prepared to act as environmental health decision makers. This project worked with coaches in a participatory study design using low cost air monitors through which both coaches and other school staff became more aware of air pollution levels, patterns and health effects at their school, on sports fields, and in surrounding communities. The project was carried out at Azusa High School and its surrounding neighborhood in the San Gabriel Valley, California, a region with significant air pollution, and dense and diverse population. Azusa High School is immediately adjacent to the high-volume 210 Freeway. 96%&nbsp; of students at Azusa High School self identify as Hispanic; 85% receive free or reduced-price lunch. Using an array of anthropological methods - including participant observation, interviews, photo documentation, and the study of school and city archival records &ndash; and quantitative statistical methods, the project produced new understandings of how coaches and students learn and become motivated to act on air quality data. The project also advanced understanding of \"science-to-governance\" pathways in school settings drawing upon the elaboration of decision making networks coaches and administrators discussed. There is a growing recognition - in academia, government and civil society - that better understanding of and support for science-to governance pathways is urgently needed to address complex social problems. These pathways need to be understood and opened&nbsp; at many levels - internationally and nationally - as well as at the level of&nbsp; households, schools, neighborhoods, cities, and states.
