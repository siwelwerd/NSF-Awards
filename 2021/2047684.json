Naturally occurring bacteria have been discovered living within these worms that may drive their survival and direct their devastating impacts on plants. These bacteria, present in some of the most damaging nematodes, are related to bacteria currently used to control mosquito-borne diseases, suggesting they may hold promise for agricultural control strategies that reduce the use of toxic chemicals to control nematodes. This project uses global sampling, DNA and RNA sequencing, computer software development, and novel experiments to uncover the function of these widespread bacteria and bridge traditionally separated fields of plant pathology, nematology, and microbiology to overcome significant roadblocks to understanding rhizosphere ecology. This project also examines how stressors such as climate change and land use affect the interactions between these bacteria, nematodes, and plants. This project will have societal and educational impacts through integrating research activities performed by an interdisciplinary science program in bioinformatics at the hosting Hispanic Serving Institution with national research-outreach programs centered on citizen science and rhizosphere biomodelling, and a local peer-mentoring program in genomics for high school students targeting traditionally underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nPlant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) are ubiquitous in soils, causing significant losses to agricultural crops and impacts on plants across terrestrial ecosystems. Recent work shows these nematodes host bacterial endosymbionts, including Wolbachia and Cardinium, which are well-known in insects to play a critical role in driving their host\u2019s biology as either reproductive parasites or mutualists. Yet, the role of these endosymbionts in PPNs is unknown. This CAREER project seeks to uncover the dynamics driving the tripartite interactions between these endosymbionts, PPNs, and plants. Research activities will (1) determine the ecological and evolutionary forces acting on PPN endosymbionts globally across natural populations through shotgun metagenomics, population genomics, database mining, and bioinformatics; (2) directly test endosymbiont impacts on host nematode fitness, phenotype, and plant parasitism through symbiont-clearing experiments on root-cultures, plants, and transparent soils, using host-symbiont gene expression analysis; and (3) investigate the dual effects of PPN endosymbionts and stressors such as climate and land use change using computational models and transplanted plant communities under temperature stress. These experiments will test the hypothesis that PPN endosymbionts drive the tripartite dynamics through controlling host reproduction or providing iron/heme or lipids and explore molecular targets for biocontrol. The project integrates research, education, and outreach objectives by developing and incorporating Citizen Science-based sampling, an undergraduate Bioinformatics Challenge program, and a summer high school Genomics Scholar program to engage and train underrepresented groups in this research. Outcomes are expected to form a new foundational understanding of these rhizosphere interactions, generate bioinformatics software, and improve training in multi-omics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
