 "awd_abstract_narration": "The future development of computers will likely depend on a qualitative change, with new technologies based on materials and mechanisms very different from those currently employed. One of the most promising alternatives centers on development of ultra-low-power cognitive computing systems inspired by the operating principles of the brain and employing new types of bio-inspired devices with functionalities which correspond to those of neurons, synapses, axons, and dendrites. This research project aims to enhance our understanding of fundamental processes of the electrically-induced switching mechanism in vanadium oxides and related materials. This knowledge will help to address the needs of high-density data storage, adaptive neural circuits, and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. In addition, this project will allow the PI and a graduate student to be trained at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation to apply techniques crucial to the central aspect of the research. Collaboration will ensure longer-term impacts and facilitate future access either through direct collaborations or through support from future research projects for use of the facilities by the PI. Participation by UPRM students in related sub-projects will be a unique educational opportunity for them directly, which will prepare them to address the challenges of electronic materials in the 21st century. \r\n\r\nThis project pursues experiments to study correlated Magn\u00e9li vanadium oxides in purpose-built nanostructures with the goal of furthering our understanding of dynamics of the electrically-induced switching of Phase Change Materials exhibiting Metal Insulator Transition and how it depends on physical and chemical parameters such as composition, stress, thickness, grain size and orientation, and local morphology. A range of appropriate characterization techniques will be employed in order to study the properties of interest here. Beyond standard ones, state-of-the-art techniques will be applied, including in-operando photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. Elucidation of the influence of parameters mentioned above on the switching mechanism and on electroformed conductive filament formation are required to assess their relative importance and to develop fabrication protocols enabling reproducible electronic characteristics in prospective devices for neuromorphic computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
