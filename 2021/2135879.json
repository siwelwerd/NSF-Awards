 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 55-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum.  The Belmont Forum is a consortium of research funding organizations focused on support for transdisciplinary approaches to global environmental change challenges and opportunities.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions. This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries.  The teams will establish transdisciplinary networks to develop innovative solutions for sustainable development pathways and seek to assess the positive and negative inter-linkages between the economy, technology, institutions with the environment, climate, biodiversity, and human well-being to understand potential pathways to a sustainable world.\r\n\r\nThe project will create an international network of experts and a community of practice to address the residual risk of flooding damage to help inform sustainable development. The exposure of human populations to flooding has increased in the last several decades, but many people are unaware that they reside in flooding risk zones.  Residual risk of extreme floods (RREflood) project aims to help manage this risk and increase communication with the public by creating a network focused on the interplay among residual risk and its management. The project members will collaboratively design a framework to integrate residual risk in local planning efforts, create a platform to facilitate advances in basic knowledge and tools to reduce residual flood risk, and identify research needs that will be beneficial to countries worldwide.  This project will promote mechanisms to raise capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management and will identify effective ways to communicate the residual flood risk to residents and stakeholders, with the goal to reduce the adverse effects of natural disasters. The international scientific community will be enhanced by the addition of a novel network of experts on residual flood risk; this network will facilitate exchanges and mutual learning to improve methods in global practice. The RREFlood project will thus create a new community around global flood risk and engage in pathways to sustainability through global research and community support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

But larger floods occur, floods that can overwhelm the capacity of levees, dams, and engineered channels.&nbsp;<strong><em>Residual flood risk</em></strong>&nbsp;is the risk of catastrophic flooding from floods larger than the design flood or resulting from the failure of flood-control infrastructure. While such floods are considered to have low probability, they have enormous consequences. A single large flood (e.g., the 2005 Hurricane Katrina or the 2023 dam breach in Derna, Libya) can wipe out many years of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Residual risk is fundamental to the&nbsp;<em>\"levee effect\"</em>, wherein the \"protection\" afforded by a flood control levee encourages more development behind the levee because it creates a false sense of security, leading to greater losses when the levee fails or is overtopped by a flood larger than the design flood.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>In the RREFlood Project&nbsp;<em>(The Residual Risk of Extreme Floods: A Challenge for Achieving Sustainable Development Goals)</em>&nbsp;we focused on the interplay between SDGs and residual risk, a topic largely ignored in practice globally. We have collaboratively (1) designed a framework to integrate residual risk in local planning efforts, (2) Identified research gaps to be addressed in future transdisciplinary projects, and (3) created a&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://smartinfrastructure.berkeley.edu/the-residual-risks-of-extreme-floods-a-challenge-for-achieving-the-sustainable-development-goals/\"><strong><span>platform</span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;to facilitate developing tools to integrate SDGs in residual flood risk assessment, mapping, management and communication. Our research team<strong>&nbsp;</strong>from the United States, Taiwan, France, Germany and Vietnam has worked collaboratively with practitioners, policy makers, and civil society organizations to create an&nbsp;international&nbsp;<strong>community of practice on residual flood risk</strong>&nbsp;(SDG 17 Partnership for the goals). We have analyzed nine case studies: Sacramento and Montecito, California, and New Orleans, Louisiana (US); Tainan (Taiwan); Jargeau and the Isle of Oleron (France); Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam), and the City of Hamburg and state of Lower Saxony (Germany), and drew upon other international experience, such as Austria and Quebec (Canada).</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Key findings</span></strong><span>&nbsp;from the case studies in relation to the SDGs:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities). The sustainability of cities depends on how residual risk is accounted for in land-use planning, and how well the public understands its residual flood risk. This depends on&nbsp;<strong>mapping and planning tools</strong>, i.e., how flood maps depict (or not) residual risk behind levees, and the implications of the mapping in terms of restricting developments in high hazard zones, requiring building codes or emergency plans, etc.</li>\r\n<li>SDGs 13 (Climate action), 14 (Life below water) and 15 (Life on land). Today there is no consensus on how to account for climate change when delineating future flood prone areas. Many countries are now exploring options to plan for climate change adaptation through&nbsp;<strong>nature-based solutions:</strong>&nbsp;expanding river corridors and reconnecting floodplains to absorb larger floods while also improving ecological habitats.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>SDG 09 (Industry innovation and infrastructure).&nbsp;<strong>Aging infrastructure</strong>&nbsp;increases the risk of failure, but&nbsp;<strong>innovative technologies</strong>&nbsp;such as low-cost fiber optic sensors using state-of-the-art photonics, are now being developed to provide real-time data on the stability of infrastructure such as dams and levees.</li>\r\n<li>SDG 10 (Reduced inequalities). Overcoming&nbsp;<strong>inequities&nbsp;</strong>in addressing residual flood risk requires&nbsp;<strong>system-scale governance</strong>. Flood risk is mostly managed at a jurisdictional/administrative level (e.g., local government), but to equitably manage flood risk, it must be understood and managed at a system scale (e.g., river-basin level) to be able to redistribute funding and prioritize action where is more needed. River-basin scale governance is now implemented across the EU (under the Floods and Water Framework Directives) and in some areas of the United States under Joint Powers Authorities.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span>We developed a six-step&nbsp;<strong>framework</strong>&nbsp;to better integrate residual flood risk into local planning efforts: (1) Create a risk culture; (2) Identify the natural and the social factors that contribute to residual flood risk; (3) Develop models of \"system-scale governance\" to manage residual flood risk in more environmentally sustainable and equitable way; (4) Develop regulatory flood maps and plans that recognize residual risk; (5) Implement these maps and plans (make tools actionable); (6) Evaluate if the current approach will reduce or increase residual flood risk long term (are the hazard, exposure and vulnerability increasing or decreasing?).</span></p>\r\n<p><span>We identify four main&nbsp;<strong>research gaps</strong>: (1) The topic of&nbsp;residual flood risk is largely ignored in literature; (2) Residual flood risk is rarely captured in the urban planning process, and thus risk reduction measures are implemented for the design flood only; (3) There is little research on perception of residual flood risk; (4) There is a need to explore potential models of system-scale governance that can be more effective not only to assess, map and manage residual flood risk but also to integrate nature-based solutions and reduce inequalities.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified:

A single large flood (e.g., the 2005 Hurricane Katrina or the 2023 dam breach in Derna, Libya) can wipe out many years of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Residual risk is fundamental to the\"levee effect\", wherein the \"protection\" afforded by a flood control levee encourages more development behind the levee because it creates a false sense of security, leading to greater losses when the levee fails or is overtopped by a flood larger than the design flood.\r\n\n\nIn the RREFlood Project(The Residual Risk of Extreme Floods: A Challenge for Achieving Sustainable Development Goals)we focused on the interplay between SDGs and residual risk, a topic largely ignored in practice globally. We have collaboratively (1) designed a framework to integrate residual risk in local planning efforts, (2) Identified research gaps to be addressed in future transdisciplinary projects, and (3) created aplatformto facilitate developing tools to integrate SDGs in residual flood risk assessment, mapping, management and communication. Our research teamfrom the United States, Taiwan, France, Germany and Vietnam has worked collaboratively with practitioners, policy makers, and civil society organizations to create aninternationalcommunity of practice on residual flood risk(SDG 17 Partnership for the goals). We have analyzed nine case studies: Sacramento and Montecito, California, and New Orleans, Louisiana (US); Tainan (Taiwan); Jargeau and the Isle of Oleron (France); Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam), and the City of Hamburg and state of Lower Saxony (Germany), and drew upon other international experience, such as Austria and Quebec (Canada).\r\n\n\nKey findingsfrom the case studies in relation to the SDGs:\r\n\r\nSDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities). The sustainability of cities depends on how residual risk is accounted for in land-use planning, and how well the public understands its residual flood risk. This depends onmapping and planning tools, i.e., how flood maps depict (or not) residual risk behind levees, and the implications of the mapping in terms of restricting developments in high hazard zones, requiring building codes or emergency plans, etc.\r\nSDGs 13 (Climate action), 14 (Life below water) and 15 (Life on land). Today there is no consensus on how to account for climate change when delineating future flood prone areas. Many countries are now exploring options to plan for climate change adaptation throughnature-based solutions:expanding river corridors and reconnecting floodplains to absorb larger floods while also improving ecological habitats.\r\nSDG 09 (Industry innovation and infrastructure).Aging infrastructureincreases the risk of failure, butinnovative technologiessuch as low-cost fiber optic sensors using state-of-the-art photonics, are now being developed to provide real-time data on the stability of infrastructure such as dams and levees.\r\nSDG 10 (Reduced inequalities). Overcominginequitiesin addressing residual flood risk requiressystem-scale governance. Flood risk is mostly managed at a jurisdictional/administrative level (e.g., local government), but to equitably manage flood risk, it must be understood and managed at a system scale (e.g., river-basin level) to be able to redistribute funding and prioritize action where is more needed. River-basin scale governance is now implemented across the EU (under the Floods and Water Framework Directives) and in some areas of the United States under Joint Powers Authorities.\r\n\r\n\n\nWe developed a six-stepframeworkto better integrate residual flood risk into local planning efforts: (1) Create a risk culture; (2) Identify the natural and the social factors that contribute to residual flood risk; (3) Develop models of \"system-scale governance\" to manage residual flood risk in more environmentally sustainable and equitable way; (4) Develop regulatory flood maps and plans that recognize residual risk; (5) Implement these maps and plans (make tools actionable); (6) Evaluate if the current approach will reduce or increase residual flood risk long term (are the hazard, exposure and vulnerability increasing or decreasing?).\r\n\n\nWe identify four mainresearch gaps: (1) The topic ofresidual flood risk is largely ignored in literature; (2) Residual flood risk is rarely captured in the urban planning process, and thus risk reduction measures are implemented for the design flood only; (3) There is little research on perception of residual flood risk; (4) There is a need to explore potential models of system-scale governance that can be more effective not only to assess, map and manage residual flood risk but also to integrate nature-based solutions and reduce inequalities.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AnnaSerra-Llobet\n"
