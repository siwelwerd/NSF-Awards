 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the University of Puerto Rico-R\u00edo Piedras, located in San Juan, PR, supports the training of 10 students for 9 weeks during the summers of 2021-2023. In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry, undergraduate participants will engage in high caliber interdisciplinary research projects inspired by rebuilding efforts in PR related to the pharmaceutical industry, electrical grid, and water infrastructure. This program also fosters professional development through in-laboratory training, hands-on workshops, and specialized seminars to inspire interest in graduate school in the STEM fields.  The broader goal of this site is to train socially conscious scientists who can address community-based problems, to help build the future STEM workforce for Puerto Rico, and to establish a network of STEM professional collaborators. \r\n\r\nStudent participants at this REU site will be matched with research groups conducting fundamental science on the engineering of materials and biomolecules for real-life applications including drug discovery, drug delivery, energy storage, and water purification. The faculty mentors have extensive experience in undergraduate training, and an advanced students or postdoctoral researchers will serve as a co-mentors, providing additional training support to the participants. Alongside research, students will take part in hands-on workshops exposing them to state-of-the-art instrumentation; a seminar series on critical thinking and technical skill development; and orientation on research, graduate school, and career opportunities. A special seminar contextualizes the program\u2019s mission to professionally rehabilitate Puerto Rico, and participants will also go on educational/cultural outings where they will  visit a pharmaceutical company and different parts of Puerto Rico. Students majoring in chemistry or related fields are recruited from two-year and four-year institutions in Puerto Rico and the rest of the U.S., particularly from minority serving institutions and from institutions with few research opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It was a Renaissance of activity to return to a semblance of &ldquo;normality&rdquo; for student and faculty mental health. A major drive was tying the program&rsquo;s STEM education and research endeavors to the local Puerto Rico need for improved infrastructure, renewable energy, and cleaner air and water, and to the national need for reviving Puerto Rico as a biopharmaceutical/industrial hot spot because at the height of the pandemic there were drug and material shortages. Over the course of three summers, the program provided 31 undergraduate students and three recent high school graduates (Year 0 students) (<strong>Figure 1</strong>) with high caliber interdisciplinary research experiences to inspire their interest in graduate programs and/or a career in the STEM fields, in particular in Chemistry. The program offered information about the Puerto Rican academic, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical job markets as viable career options. A diverse set of research laboratories participated in PR-CLIMB, focusing on fundamental studies on the engineering of materials and biomolecules for potential applications in water purification, energy storage, sensing, drug design, and drug delivery. All participants or PR-CLIMBers, as we like to call them, received mentorship from the principal investigator of the laboratories and a co-mentor in the form of a senior undergraduate/graduate student or postdoctoral researcher.</p>\n<p>The three summers of this cycle of the program ran in the traditional summer, 9-week modality on the UPR R&iacute;o Piedras campus. The PR-CLIMBers participated in workshops with hands-on experiences on modern chemical instrumentation. The workshops focused on topics in cell culturing, MALDI TOF TOF, high resolution NMR, chromatography, x-ray characterization, electrochemistry, nanoparticle characterization, and surface analysis. The participants also engaged in a seminar series in which presentations on scientific writing, ethics in research, communication and presentation skills, online resources, professional development, graduate studies and research fellowship opportunities were offered. As part of this series, the students presented their research plans via a flash oral presentation designed for a general scientific audience. The participants had the unique opportunity to the local pharmaceutical company Lilly del Caribe. Due to the COVID19 pandemic, some video content was created that was used to streamline some portions of the lectures of workshops. Nonparticipant students were invited to participated in these activities. During the Closing Ceremony Research Symposia, the participants presented their research results as oral lectures that were evaluated by a panel of judges. The participant earning the highest evaluation each summer was awarded full support to attend a national conference. These symposia serve to emphasize the &ldquo;bigger picture&rdquo; purpose of the program and professionals from diverse STEM sectors are invited as guest speakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact</strong></p>\n<p>The PR-CLIMB program has attracted an ethnically, culturally, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse student pool from all over the United States with the help of a dedicated team of faculty from other universities throughout Puerto Rico and the mainland, who serve as liaisons. We have made a strong effort to recruit students who would be most transformed by the traineeship offered by PR-CLIMB and who could be a tremendous asset to the program by bringing fresh ideas (<strong>Table 1</strong>). The program has been extremely successful in helping to maintain participants in the STEM fields (<strong>Table 2</strong>) and producing several post-program accomplishments. Students have presented their PR-CLIMB research at national conferences; an average of six per year. Collectively, the program has generated 13 peer reviewed publications with several pending publication in the coming academic year. &nbsp;Some of the local participants have continued to perform research with their REU mentors.</p>\n<p>The PR-CLIMB program has also extended its services beyond the core participants. It has provided mentorship training opportunities to the student mentors of the program and has propelled their respective doctoral/postdoctoral work. The program has networked with other on-campus summer traineeships such as the REU MAPS program, American Chemical Society Project SEED, and NIH STEP UP to share resources and offer its workshops and seminars to their respective participants. These resources were also shared with other summer student researchers not affiliated with these programs. The P.I. obtained NSF MPS-High supplemental funding in summer 2022 to expand the PR CLIMB program to include low-income underrepresented high school seniors who are not local to Puerto Rico. He established a collaboration with the Minds Matter college prep program to recruit Year 0 students. The program has even extended its reach into science outreach, most recently preparing a video on inclusivity designed for the ACS Festivals. These accomplishments demonstrate PR-CLIMB&rsquo;s excellent sustainability and vast outreach.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 08/28/2024<br>\nModified by: Arthur&nbsp;Tinoco</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2050493/2050493_10719391_1724875486285_Table_2--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2050493/2050493_10719391_1724875486285_Table_2--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Table 2.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2050493/2050493_10719391_1724875486285_Table_2--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Table 2.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Table 2.
