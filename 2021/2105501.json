 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project in low-dimensional topology develops tools for classifying three-dimensional spaces as well as surfaces and knotted curves within them. Applications of these topological objects range from exploring the possible shapes of the three-dimensional spatial universe we live in to understanding the knotting of polymers and DNA. These three-dimensional objects are studied by analyzing certain invariant properties which capture essential characteristics of the objects. A successful family of such invariants, which has lead to numerous applications since it was first developed two decades ago, is called Heegaard Floer homology. The definition of Heegaard Floer homology draws on sophisticated techniques from multiple fields, including topology, geometry, and analysis. This project aims to reformulate some of these invariants in a way that both sheds light on their underlying structure and also provides computational tools and leads to new applications. In particular, the PI aims to translate bordered Heegaard Floer invariants for 3-manifolds with boundary, which take the form of complicated algebraic objects, into geometric objects built from collections of curves in a surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the structure of Heegaard Floer homology with the goal to extend and better understand the Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT)-like structure in Heegaard Floer theory and to apply it to problems in low-dimensional topology. First, the PI aims to extend the earlier results to the stronger \u201cminus\u201d version of Heegaard Floer homology, which carries more information and also has interesting connections to four-dimensional invariants. The PI will also consider the case of manifolds with higher genus boundary or with multiple boundary components. In a related direction, the PI will explore the behavior of invariants for knots under the satellite operation and concordance. A long-term goal is to study the Fukaya categories of symmetric products of surfaces and morphisms between them, finding practical geometric descriptions of these objects which fit into a description of Heegaard Floer homology as a (2+1+1)-dimensional Topological Quantum Field Theory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We study these objects by computing topological invariants, quantifiable properties that are unchanged by continuous deformation. The project was particularly focused on Heegaard Floer homology, a family of invariants that has proved valuable in low dimensional topology but that is also very difficult to compute. One approach to computing these invariants is a divide-and-conquer strategy in which we break an object into pieces, compute invariants for those pieces, and stitch the results back together. The pieces are not of quite the same nature as the original object (for instance, while the original object often has no boundary the pieces have boundary where the cuts were made), so this strategy requires different versions of the invariants that make sense on the pieces. In the case of Heegaard Floer homology these take the form of either knot Floer homology or bordered Heegaard Floer homology. The project aimed to develop new methods for using these invariants by relating them to immersed curves in surfaces.<br /><br />During the period of this project several results from an earlier project were finalized and published, including two papers proving an equivalence between the simplified &ldquo;hat&rdquo; version of bordered Heegaard Floer invariants for manifolds with torus boundary and immersed curves in the torus with one point removed. We showed that when gluing two such manifolds together, the Heegaard Floer invariant of the resulting manifold comes from counting intersections between the two curves. There were several applications of this theorem, including progress on important open problems including the cosmetic surgery conjecture.<br /><br />This project proceeded to improve on those methods by enhancing them to work with a stronger version of Heegaard Floer invariant. The stronger invariant, called the &ldquo;minus&rdquo; version, carries more information than the &ldquo;hat&rdquo; version but it is more technically difficult. The PI showed that for knots the immersed curves representing the &ldquo;hat&rdquo; flavor invariant can be enhanced to represent the &ldquo;mini&rdquo; flavor invariant, where to enhance the curves we decorate them with a subset of the self-intersection points. Progress was also made on an analogous result in a more general setting using bordered Heegaard Floer homology.<br /><br />The project also applied immersed curve techniques to prove new results. One area was the to study of satellite knots, which are knots formed by tying a knot K in a solid torus that contains another knot P . In joint work with a collaborator the PI showed the knot Floer homology invariants for certain satellite knots can be computed using immersed curves.
