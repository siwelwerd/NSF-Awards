 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is devoted to organizing a strategic visioning workshop on Ising Machines.  The meeting will be held virtually over two days.  Major themes include overarching issues for Ising Machines as special-purpose computers for non-convex optimization, strategies for maximizing the practical impact of future research on Ising Machines, and assessment of current status and next steps for hardware devices and architectures including both CMOS and non-CMOS (e.g. optical) platforms. Recasting the foundations of computational optimization to leverage emerging physics, mathematics, and management science will require an expansive technology co-design approach that facilitates simultaneous and coordinated rethinking of devices, architectures, algorithms and performance metrics, in order to develop a concrete vision for optimization co-design grounded in recent work on post-von Neumann Ising Machines (PVNIMs).  The intention of the workshop is to spark the coalescence of vertically-integrated research communities around existing experimental hardware platforms and build consensus regarding overarching goals for improving both the basic understanding of non-convex optimization and the practical impact of frontier efforts. The workshop will also build a new community around the emerging technology of post-von Neumann Ising machines, and generally promote vertical integration of research on the theory and practice of non-convex optimization.  Advances in this area have a high likelihood to impact broad areas of industry and policy.  The summary document to be prepared by the Steering Committee after the workshop is intended likewise to influence research priorities across the CISE Directorate, leading to increased opportunities for interdisciplinary research and training in academic groups nationwide.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur work on this award was focused toward the offering of an online workshop on the subject of Ising Machines.  The workshop was held live via Zoom on 7-8 April 2022 and featured academic and industrial speakers from the United States, Canada, and Japan.  The workshop was publicized by notices distributed via relevant email lists known to the workshop organizers, and via the Twitter accounts of featured speakers.  A new website, https://ising.vision, was set up to facilitate workshop registration and to make video recordings of selected talks available on a continuing basis.  A total of 193 individuals from around the world pre-registered via the ising.vision website to obtain login credentials for the workshop.\n\nThe first day of the workshop focused mainly on the theory of Ising Machines -- a class of nonconventional computer architectures tailored for solving optimization problems -- and on technical considerations related to the nature of practical optimization problems arising in industries such as transportation logistics and computer chip design.  The second day focused primarily on novel hardware devices being investigated for improved future implementations of Ising machine architectures, including conventional electronic devices and novel devices based on light signals (photonics).\n\nResearch on Ising Machines is in an early stage and the outlook for this class of computing architectures is constantly changing.  The talks presented during our workshop revealed several major directions in recent work. Benchmarking of prototype hardware Ising Machines (both electronic and hybrid opto-electronic) as well as software Ising Machine simulators is a popular topic of study, and research teams are working to characterize what kinds of optimization problems Ising Machines are best for.  Another major direction is mathematical analysis of Ising Machine behavior using smiplified models, with similar aims of understanding what kinds of optimization problems Ising Machines are best for.  Research groups studying novel hardware devices for Ising Machine architectures are trying to develop roadmaps for implementing Ising Machine-type computers that can offer revolutionary advantages in either speed or energy efficiency.\n\nA novel emerging theme in Ising Machine research focuses on either demonstrating that quantum physics plays a role in determining the performance of current hardware prototypes, or elucidating how future Ising Machine implementations could achieve better performance by leveraging quantum effects.  Some groups have begun to explore whether there might be connections between Ising Machines and certain types of quantum computers, such as adiabatic quantum optimizers.\n\nOverall, our Ising Machine workshop contributed to the coalescence of an international research community interested in physics-inspired approaches to optimization.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/16/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hideo Mabuchi"
