 "awd_abstract_narration": "The COVID-19 epidemic has been a tremendous disruption to the education of U.S. students and their families, and evidence suggests that this disruption has been unequally felt across households by income and race/ethnicity. While other ongoing data collection efforts focus on understanding this disruption from the perspective of students or educators, less is known about the impact of COVID-19 on children\u2019s prek-12 educational experiences as reported by their parents, especially in STEM subjects. This study will build upon the team's prior research from early in the pandemic. Researchers will continue to collect data from families and aims to understand parents\u2019 perspectives on the educational impacts of COVID-19 by leveraging a nationally representative, longitudinal study, the Understanding America Study (UAS). The study will track educational experiences during the Spring and Summer of 2021 and into the 2021-22 school year. The team will analyze outcomes overall and for key demographic groups of interest as students and teachers return to in-person instruction during 2021. This RAPID project allows critically important data to continue to be collected and contribute to continued understanding of the impacts of and responses to the pandemic by American families.  \r\n\r\nSince March of 2020, the UAS has been tracking the educational impacts of COVID-19 for a nationally representative sample of approximately 1,400 households with preK-12 children. Early results focused on quantifying the digital divide and documenting the receipt of important educational services--like free meals and special education services--after COVID-19 began. This project will support the continued targeted administration of UAS questions to parents about students\u2019 learning experiences and engagement, overall and in STEM subjects, data analysis, and dissemination of results to key stakeholder groups. Findings will be reported overall and across key demographic groups including ethnicity, disability, urbanicity, and socioeconomic status. This project will also produce targeted research briefs addressing pressing policy questions aimed at supporting intervention strategies in states, districts, and schools moving forward. Widespread dissemination will take place through existing networks and in collaboration with other research projects focused on understanding the COVID-19 crisis. All cross-sectional and longitudinal UAS data files will be publicly available shortly after conclusion of administration so that other researchers can explore the correlates of, and outcomes associated with, COVID-19.\r\n\r\nThis RAPID award is made by the DRK-12 program in the Division of Research on Learning. The Discovery Research PreK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics by preK-12 students and teachers, through the research and development of new innovations and approaches. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for the projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Topics addressed in 2021 included technology and services access; parents' policy preferences; levels of concern about children's academic progress, mental health, and physical health; features of remote learning parents hope will continue; and perspectives on effective instructional practices. We also collected measures of parents' perceptions of children?s school quality.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Access to resources</em></strong></p>\n<p>In spring 2021, we measured shares of families whose children's schools were offering tutoring, summer school, and pods?

We found targeted messages successfully increased parents' reported willingness to send their children to school in-person among those who had previously been unsure (Figure 1). Our&nbsp;<em>Educational Researcher&nbsp;</em>article summarizes this experiment.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Attendance preferences and modes&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p>Through winter and spring 2021, we learned child enrollment mode and parents'enrollment preferences continued to differ considerably by parent race and family income.

Parents of Black and Asian-American children were more concerned than parents of White children in these domains, and about their children's psychological well-being and peer relationships. Parent concerns declined dramatically by the end of the 2020-21 school year and into summer 2021 in these domains including the amount children were learning.&nbsp;In fall 2021, we continued measuring parents' concerns about their children&nbsp;and parent satisfaction with their children's schools. Concerns by fall 2021 continued to drop and parent satisfaction--with over 90% of children attending school in-person--was similar to pre-COVID satisfaction (measured retrospectively).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Policy preferences</em></strong></p>\n<p>In fall 2020, we learned parents were highly, and increasingly, supportive of mask mandates in schools,&nbsp;and of canceling standardized tests.&nbsp;By spring 2021, we showed parents' support for masks and vaccines in schools varied considerably by political partisanship and race/ethnicity. Also by spring 2021, parents' support for standardized tests had rebounded.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dissemination of results&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p>Our work highlights the equity implications of the pandemic and suggests the importance of encouraging widespread in-person learning opportunities and attendance for addressing COVID-19?s educational effects.</p>\n<p>During the Grant #2120194 timeframe, we published K-12 education results in two peer-reviewed journals,&nbsp;<em>AERA Open&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;Educational Researcher.</em>&nbsp;We also published in trade journals including&nbsp;<em>74million</em>, and general interest outlets including&nbsp;<em>Brookings,&nbsp;</em>the<em>&nbsp;LA Times,&nbsp;</em>and the<em>&nbsp;Urban Institute</em>.
