 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over sixty percent of Earth\u2019s ice-free areas are best described as human-modified anthropogenic biomes. This means that pristine areas are scarce, and that most ecological studies are de facto studies of anthropogenic impacts on ecological systems. However, the study of pristine systems is necessary for developing a baseline understanding of ecological function so that we can apply this understanding to develop meaningful and appropriate conservation plans, or even know what applied research questions are worth pursuing. Unfortunately, pristine systems are at a premium. In general, graduate students do not have the opportunity to develop their ecological understanding under pristine or near pristine ecological systems. In addition, the National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine data suggest that current STEM graduate student training may not be providing a rigorous education in quantitative experimental design. Quantitative experimental design is designing studies with an eye toward the statistical analyses that will be used to analyze the data. Using quantitative design principles, rooted in sound ecological theory, ensures that researchers are asking relevant and testable questions that will lead to meaningful results. This is a crucial component of graduate student education and researcher professional development, as it ensures that increasingly scarce research funding are not wasted Additionally, collaboration is becoming the norm in research, and international collaboration via electronic media was becoming increasingly common even before the current pandemic. In this IRES Track II project, students will have the opportunity to be trained in quantitative experimental design and work as part of a multinational research collaboration to study infectious disease emergence in one of the few remaining pristine places on Earth. The Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve (CHBR) off the southern tip of South America protects pristine ecosystem is perfect for this type of graduate student training. The CHBR is part of the sub-Antarctic Magellanic ecoregion, which is globally significant because it houses the worlds southernmost forest biome, contains numerous endemic species, is remote, and is relatively free of anthropogenic impacts. In addition, with the exception of Avian Malaria which arrived just a few years ago, the system is relatively free of zoonotic diseases. Making the region a living laboratory to study the ecosystem transformations that co-occur with human discovery and settlement of an area. \r\n\r\nThe program will bring graduate students from across the US to work in international collaborative teams with Chilean students from the Universidad de Magallanes (UMAG) and the Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity (IEB) in Chile, and a diverse group of faculty from across the US and Chile. The focus of the program will to be provide graduate students robust and hands-on training in quantitative experimental design and international collaboration resulting in publications. The research questions themselves will be flexible, but organized thematically. Specifically, this IRES Track-II will focus on the merging molecular genetic analysis using a mobile next generation sequencing lab with mist netting and arthropod trapping to investigate the impacts of wildlife disease on local biodiversity and community structure. Secondarily, eDNA and traditional wildlife disease monitoring approaches will be applied to understand the potential for zoonosis and understanding ecological factors that contribute to, or inhibit, zoonosis. Resultantly, participation in this program will help train the next generation of scientists with the skills needed to make meaningful contributions to the study of ecology, conservation, and wildlife disease ecology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
