 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF INCLUDES Planning Grant: Inclusive Biology Exploring Active Research with Students (iBEARS): Infusing 21st Century Skill Development in Undergraduate STEM Curriculum\r\n\r\n\r\nThis NSF INCLUDES planning grant is funded by NSF Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES), a comprehensive national initiative to enhance U.S. leadership in discoveries and innovations by focusing on diversity, inclusion, and broadening participation in STEM at scale. The goal of this planning grant is to create a shared vision by connecting current and future Inclusive Biologists Engaging in Active Research with Students (iBEARS) collaborators (faculty from biology and education departments, middle school science department administrators, and middle school science teachers) to expand and scale up the current, ongoing project infusing 21st century professional skill development into undergraduate STEM curriculum. For the purposes of this grant, 21st century professional skills are skills with domain-neutral competencies (such as communication, creativity, and problem-solving) that employers identify as important for success in an economy characterized by globalization and rapid technological change. Minoritized populations in undergraduate science programs have access to fewer opportunities to acquire 21st century professional skills when compared to other peer groups, which may make them less competitive for high paying or prestigious jobs after graduation. This inequity results in a lack of diversity of perspectives in the STEM workforce, leading to reduced innovation and creative output.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe approach to the shared visioning project is to hold a workshop bringing together biology and education faculty, 4th-8th grade teachers, and school administrators interested in inclusion to share resources and evidence-based practices for iBEARS implementation. Specifically, a two-day workshop will be convened to help new iBEARS network members plan for iBEARS implementation and assessment in the classrooms as well as facilitate the collaboration of network participants to develop new iBEARS resources and products. Participants will experience iBEARS presentations from current 4th-8th grade classes, participate in question and answer sessions with iBEARS undergraduates and 4th-8th grade teachers, and learn about the evidence-based instructional techniques used in iBEARS-supported classrooms. Participants will leave the workshop with a detailed plan as to how faculty will be supported to implement iBEARS in classes and institution wide. It is also expected that teams may come up with novel research questions to explore, thereby developing a novel research agenda based on participants\u2019 specific interests. To provide a platform for collaboration and house all iBEARS resources, making the resources freely accessible, a QUBEShub website will be constructed. This website will facilitate interactions between iBEARS collaborators, iBEARS steering committee members, and other key stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
