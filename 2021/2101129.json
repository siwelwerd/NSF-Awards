 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory research will create an innovative mechanical hybridization process to address environmental sustainability challenges of the electric vehicle (EV) battery industry. The project will test the hypothesis that the active materials from spent lithium ion batteries can be directly recycled in their original structures, hybridized with their pristine counterparts, and then reused in the manufacturing of new lithium ion battery pouch cells with desired electrochemical performance. The research will be carried out systematically through both mathematical modeling and experimental investigation, to generate new knowledge on direct recycling of EV batteries, material science of hybrid electrode materials, electrochemical science of pouch cells, life cycle assessment, and techno-economic analysis of EV batteries. \r\n\r\nIn this research, a novel electrochemical model will be developed to simulate and optimize pouch cell performance using the hybrid active materials, to be validated and improved through experimental investigation. Potential savings on environmental impact and economic costs from employing the recycled battery materials in new battery manufacturing will be quantified and evaluated through development of a comprehensive life cycle assessment model and a process-based techno-economic analysis model. Improving environmental sustainability and reducing economic cost of lithium ion batteries are critical for future large fleet deployment of EVs. This project will generate broader impacts through exploratory research to develop a circular economy for the EV battery industry and educating students, industrial professionals, and public stakeholders through research training, enhanced curriculum, industrial seminars/workshops, news releases, and Youtube videos. Research results will be disseminated through academic journals, conference presentations, and internet media, with the aim of improving people\u2019s understanding on the potential environmental and economic performance of the future EV industry with a possible circular economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
