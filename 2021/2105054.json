 "awd_abstract_narration": "Getting \"in the zone,\" whether it be from an immersive video game, playing a sport, or knitting a sweater, is a natural response of the mind that allows people to fully concentrate and cope with difficult, tedious, and often repetitive tasks. This response, known as entering a cognitive state of flow, has many known benefits within craft and making communities, including a lessened impact of failure, a distorted sense of time, and a disappearance of self-consciousness that are often associated with the \"joy of making.\" This project promotes the progress of science by developing a method of detecting flow states from wearable sensor technologies. By better understanding how tasks, environments, and individual characteristics influence flow, this project will provide principles for designing and evaluating creative technologies that support novice makers in developing positive coping mechanisms.  The team will also create tools and tutorials that will allow the methods to be taken up by researchers and designers in making and related domains.\r\n\r\nFlow is a well-studied and valuable concept to interaction design, yet researchers and designers are limited to using flow as a form of qualitative assessment. By treating flow as an activity recognition problem, this project will investigate how off-the-shelf physiological and activity sensing can be used to unobtrusively recognize flow on a moment-by-moment scale. Through documentation of users completing equivalent flow-intensive tasks, this work will develop (1) the first open-access flow activity dataset of its kind, (2) a benchmark deep learning model of flow, and (3) an open-source qualitative analysis tool that provides real-time flow characterization. This research will produce knowledge to reinforce and extend our understanding of the body's response to flow states; in conjunction, case studies will produce design exemplars to operationalize how flow can be used as a design variable to induce or sustain flow states within creative technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Grounded in cognitive psychology, this project aimed to identify factors that sustain cognitive flow &ndash; a state of deep focus and immersion &ndash; and develop strategies to support and enhance this state.<br /><br /><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>Our research sought to document and analyze the factors contributing to sustained cognitive flow. Entering a cognitive state of flow is a natural response of the mind that allows individuals to fully concentrate and cope with tedious, often repetitive tasks. Understanding how to trigger or sustain flow has historically been limited to retrospective surveys, indicating a need for better documentation. Our project addressed this gap by contributing the first dataset to study flow in the context of a flow-inducing task, specifically braidmaking.</p>\n<p>Using an instrumented Kumihimo braidmaking tool and off-the-shelf biosignal wristbands, we recorded the experiences of 24 users engaged in three different braidmaking tasks. The data collection was thorough, capturing a wide range of physiological and telemetry data, including inertial measurement unit (IMU) data, electromyography (EMG), electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate, skin temperature, and detailed braiding telemetry. We then annotated this data with Flow Short Scale (FSS) scores, providing a rich dataset for examining the nuances of cognitive flow in physical making.<br /><br />Our data analysis revealed that the prevailing skill-challenge hypothesis does not fully explain flow experiences. While matching skill level to task difficulty is important, our findings highlighted that changes in physiological markers, such as skin temperature, were reliable correlates to experiences of flow with newcomer users, whereas complexity of movement was more indicitive of flow states in experieced users. Changes in braiding speed in the first 5 minutes of braiding were also found to be reliable indicators of expertise.This suggests that physiological responses play a more significant role in identifying flow than previously understood.</p>\n<p>To facilitate deeper analysis of flow activity, we developed a crowdsourced video annotation method for extracting tacit and qualitative descriptions. This method enabled us to gain more nuanced insights into how flow is experienced and sustained across different physical making tasks. Beyond braidmaking, we extended our research to develop a generalizable thread model that supports the design of flow triggers - or design interventions for supporting flow -- in other needlecrafts domains such as e-textiles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>The project provided significant training and educational opportunities, contributing to the development of future researchers and practitioners. The research led to the completion of a Ph.D. dissertation focused on explainable datasets. Three Ph.D. students and three undergraduate researchers received extensive training in conducting human subjects research, equipping them with essential skills for their future careers. Our dataset was a key resource in a three-day undergraduate research workshop involving five female students, providing hands-on experience with data analysis and interpretation and fostering interest in research careers. Additionally, one female student participated in a 10-week research experience, using the dataset to drive her investigations on the power law of practice and its relation to flow.</p>\n<p><br />The insights gained from this research have significant implications across various fields, including education, workplace productivity, and finding joy in making. Our findings can inform the design of educational programs and maker spaces that foster deeper engagement and learning through hands-on activities. By creating environments that support cognitive flow, educators can enhance students' learning experiences and outcomes, promoting sustained interest and achievement. Understanding the factors that sustain cognitive flow can help organizations design work environments and tasks that enhance employee focus and productivity. This is particularly relevant for roles that involve creative problem-solving and innovation, where sustained flow can lead to higher quality and more innovative outcomes. The BraidFlow dataset and the Kumihimo braiding telemetry instrument have been made publicly available for researchers to examine and validate different hypotheses on how to trigger and sustain the cognitive state of flow.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 06/13/2024<br>\nModified by: Cesar&nbsp;A&nbsp;Torres</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2105054/2105054_10728760_1718300011769_Group_135--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2105054/2105054_10728760_1718300011769_Group_135--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"The BraidFlow Dataset\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2105054/2105054_10728760_1718300011769_Group_135--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"The BraidFlow Dataset\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Using an instrumented Kumihimo braidmaking tool and off-the-shelf biosignal wristbands, we record the experiences of 24 users engaged in 3 different braidmaking tasks.
