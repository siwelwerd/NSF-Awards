 "awd_abstract_narration": "The end of traditional scaling paradigms coupled with innovations in machine learning are driving unprecedented changes in the formulation of scientific applications as well as the nature of high-performance computing (HPC) software and application ecosystems. As a consequence, scientific applications increasingly depend on heterogeneous components with diverse computational characteristics and performance challenges, coordinated in agile and innovative ways. The Runtime for Heterogeneous APplications, Service Orchestration and DYnamism (RHAPSODY) addresses challenges arising from heterogeneity and need for performance. It will enable the effective and efficient execution of scientific applications at unprecedented scale and on a variety of current and upcoming HPC platforms.\r\n\r\nRHAPSODY is a scalable, fault-tolerant and portable runtime system to enable scientific communities to innovate by effectively executing applications composed of heterogeneous components on current and upcoming computing platforms. RHAPSODY provides missing runtime capabilities to application and middleware developers, fostering the integration of existing software systems and, ultimately, a more efficient use of existing resources. Together, these contributions make RHAPSODY a tool to advance scientific discovery in multiple domains.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
