 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will support Cyberinfrastructure (CI) training for environmental science research, education, and practice in the Hawaii-Pacific region. Environmental issues in the region affect health, economic stability, and ways of life for Indigenous and other communities. This project will create workshops and curriculum modules for undergraduate and graduate students to increase CI skills across the environmental science domain. By providing the next generation of environmental scientists and practitioners with advanced CI skills, these future professionals will have the ability to use CI to transform science in the region across academic research institutions, public agencies, and community stakeholders. \r\n\r\nThe project will build a multi-level capacity enhancement program for CI training and skills development that will serve CI users, contributors, and professionals in the environmental and climate science communities. The training materials in the workshops and curriculum modules will be incorporated in undergraduate and graduate courses in order to promote CI skills development and awareness. The project will increase the pool of CI professionals and facilitate knowledge transfer from existing CI professionals to the environmental and climate science communities. As well, it will advance domain-specific CI skills development to position students as CI contributors in their future professional careers. The project will deliver important impacts to the environmental and climate science communities in the Pacific Island region, as there are unique aspects to the region, as well as to others in and beyond the region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
