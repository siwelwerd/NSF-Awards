 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2022 Penrose Conference of the Geological Society of America on progressive rock failure (PRF2022) will bring together approximately 75 international scientists and engineers to facilitate a step-change in our understanding of rock fracture in both built and natural environments. To fully understand rock fracture is to understand elements of Earth that are critical for societal health and safety including: natural hazards related to rockfalls and landslides; degradation of rock-related infrastructure; rock weathering and erosion; and even the size and distribution of sedimentary particles and the internal structure \u2013 architecture - of Earth\u2019s uppermost crust, which contribute to Earth\u2019s soils and hold its water and natural resources.  Yet, traditionally geoscientists studying natural rock fracture have largely overlooked the knowledge and implications to be derived from rock physics and engineering research, and vice versa. Therefore, a key goal of PRF2022 is to open doors to new insights that may be gained by studying progressive rock failure in the context of geotechnical engineering, surface processes, natural hazards and stone heritage problems.  This goal will be achieved by maximizing both disciplinary diversity and participant diversity of the conference. To ensure longevity and accessibility of conference\u2019s outcomes, PRF2022 will also provide a mentoring scheme for early career and student attendees and communicate the conference ideas with the public and among scientists themselves. \r\n\r\nThere is a burgeoning recognition of 1) the central role that fractures play in Critical Zone processes, landscape evolution, and geotechnical problems; and 2) a \u2018new\u2019 realm of fracture mechanics that applies to both engineered and natural surface processes but has been understudied in those contexts - namely progressive rock failure (a.k.a. subcritical cracking, environmental cracking and microcracking). In particular, the role of progressive rock failure in natural rock fracture has been largely unrecognized or misunderstood across a wide array of both surface process and engineering applications, where it likely plays a dominant role. To best leverage recent, rapidly evolving cross-discipline conceptualizations of rock fracture and its relationship to erosion, hazards, preservation, climate, and chemical weathering, this Penrose Conference will be held in Western North Carolina, USA (June 2022). PRF2022 will: provide a platform to identify complementary data/observations and modelling approaches; reveal key existing and needed datasets; stimulate new multidisciplinary collaborations and scientific and commercial funding opportunities; and build a framework for future evaluation of PRF within both academic and applied Earth sciences questions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

All of the presented research demonstrated connections to progressive fracturing of rock and the factors that influence it. Traditionally, fracture-focused research involving surface processes on Earth and other planets - and in infrasturacture settings - had not recognized the progressive, incremental nature of the fracture, but instead had thought of fracturing as 'one-off' events where rocks 'fail' due to the application of single forces that exceed their strength. The PRF2022 conference was focused on a new framework for understanding rock fracture in surface environments, through the lens of 'subcritical cracking'. Subcritical cracking occurs at stresses that can be much lower than a rock's strength, and typically involves chemical reactions that break chemical bonds at the crack?s tip.

Namely, attendees were in strong agreement that not only will a wide-adoption of this new framework by the geomorphology community serve to advance knowledge within surface processes research, but also that it can aid other scientists who study fractures in rock mechanics, structural geology and rock physics disciplines to advance knowledge in understanding rock fracturing processes overall.

Melissa similarly, throughout the conference, engaged us to re-express key concepts of our discussions, bridging the gaps between our different sciences and even between the science of fracture and the wider public.

Doing so for the following words might really catch your attention, as it did that of conference attendees in summarizing the conference?s research: All rocks have cracks - small or large that are brought on by the combination of stresses big and small found in a rock's environment. These cracks can serve to weaken the rock or to make it stronger. They interact with each other and the environment, and grow in unexpected ways. In some cases, the rock cracks may be obvious but difficult to predict, or they may be barely perceptible but result in expected outcomes.
