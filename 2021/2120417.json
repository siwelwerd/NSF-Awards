 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CRISPR in the Classroom Network seeks to expand current undergraduate laboratory curriculum to include CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology.  In the last decade, CRISPR-Cas9 has become a mainstream technique in molecular biology, and a basic understanding of the methodology is essential for our undergraduates to enter research careers workforce-ready. However, as is the case with any new technology, course instructors need access to training, professional development opportunities, and support to bring CRISPR-Cas9 into their curricula, which is not always readily available.  This CRISPR in the Classroom network will provide flexible, easily adapted curriculum and mentoring to instructors and start-up kits to overcome the hurdles associated with learning and testing new curriculum in class.     \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the program include the development of a national network of biology educators at both two- and four-year institutions dedicated to the development and implementation of laboratory activities centered on experiential-based work with CRISPR-Cas9 and the creation of an online repository of CRISPR-Cas9 based modules across multiple model systems through the NSF-Supported Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Education and Synthesis (QUBES) Hub. A series of workshops will be offered to instructors, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students to provide the necessary training and mentoring needed to be comfortable implementing CRISPR-Cas9 into the curriculum.  As instructors modify the curriculum to fit their institutions and resources, the QUBES site will provide a central, searchable location to share their work where other laboratory instructors can find modules and a community of support as they work to ensure their undergraduate curriculum is on the cutting-edge of science. \r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/). This project is also supported by the NSF HSI and and IUSE:EHR programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
