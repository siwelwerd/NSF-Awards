Grain size analysis is relevant to many disciplines within the natural sciences helping to elucidate past surface Earth environmental conditions and physical processes that led to the sedimentary record recorded in lake, ocean, and lithified sediments.  Grain size analysis is also pertinent to studies of mineral aerosols that impact human health and biological activity in soils and sediments.  The equipment will support student research training in Geology and Biology at this undergraduate Hispanic Serving Institution.\r\n\r\nA laser diffraction based particle size analyzer will be acquired and used to support research investigator and students research that will include identifying and characterizing earthquake-generated turbidite deposits in seismically-sensitive lakes in the western US, constructing continuous records of climate and glacier dynamics in Arctic and alpine environments, assessing the relative roles of climate and human drivers of Arctic landscape change, studies of marine bioerosion and dissolution processes occurring in shallow coastal ecosystems as a result of anthropogenic stressors, and studies of soil geochemistry and plant-soil interactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
