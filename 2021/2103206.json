Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. \r\n\r\nThe title of the project for this fellowship to Robert A. Jeffs is \" Classifying Convex Neural Codes\". The host institution for the fellowship is Carnegie Mellon University, and the sponsoring scientist is Florian Frick.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
