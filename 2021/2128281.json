 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate change is expected to result in increased global mean temperatures that will lead to movement of tropical and sub-tropical species toward the poles, a process known as \u201ctropicalization\u201d. Changes in precipitation patterns are predicted to be spatially variable, with some regions becoming drier and others wetter. The ecology and health of stream ecosystems are particularly susceptible to changes in rainfall and temperature. Simultaneously, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are expected to increase, and it is unknown how these extreme events will interact with gradual changes in temperature and precipitation to affect stream ecosystems. This research evaluates how a recent extreme event, the February 2021 \u201cpolar vortex\u201d in Texas, interacts with changing mean climate conditions to predict how climate change will impact the structure and function of U.S. stream ecosystems in the coming decades. The research leverages a steep, natural rainfall gradient that features an abrupt shift in stream community composition and ecosystem functioning between semi-arid and mesic ecosystems. Repeated field measurements are being made for one year after the polar vortex and these data compared to prior data collected from these streams over the last 4 years. This work greatly increases our understanding of how climate change will affect sub-tropical stream ecosystems and their biota. Training of undergraduates (including minority) and graduate students along with community outreach via an established K\u201312 program contribute to the project\u2019s broader impacts for society.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this research are to characterize the direct and indirect impacts of an extreme cold event (ECE) on stream ecosystem structure and function and to examine the role of organism traits and local environmental features that drive these effects. Punctuated low temperatures below an organism\u2019s thermal limits can result in physiological, behavioral, and fitness consequences. These events are particularly important in the context of understanding tropicalization. Warm-adapted species are expanding poleward but lack adaptations for cold conditions, and thus may be more vulnerable to ECEs, driving mass mortality events. The impact of mass mortality events on ecosystem functioning may last for months to years and result in population declines, changes to community composition, and the contribution of dead individuals to the organic matter pool. The following hypotheses are being tested: 1) mesic streams will have greater thermal buffering capacity than semi-arid sites due to their greater discharge per unit watershed and greater tree canopy that creates a microclimate above the water surface; 2) taxa in semi-arid streams will have greater cold tolerance because many of them have adaptations to cope with harsh conditions; 3) taxa with neotropical ancestry will have lower cold tolerance due to a lack of adaptions for cold stress; 4) fish and invertebrate mortality will indirectly affect the abundance of algae and benthic organic matter, impacting stream metabolism. Because ECEs may become more common in the future, studying this historically rare event may help us understand how ECEs may interact with \u201ctropicalization\u201d. Furthermore, the utilization of a steep rainfall gradient provides an exceptional opportunity to study the interaction between extreme disturbance and long-term climate conditions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe evaluated the effects of an unprecedented cold event that occurred in February of 2021 in the coastal bend region of Texas on the animals that live in coastal streams within that region.  Air temperatures plummeted to 15 degrees farenheit, the coldest air temperature for that month in the ~ 140 year temperature record of that region, and water temperatures briefly dipped to below 40 degree F.   Leveraging a recently completed multi-year project of sampling of fish and benthic invertebrates in nine streams within the region, we extended our field operations through Fall of 2021 to evalute the effects of the cold event on the resident fauna.  We observed variation in the faunal responses, with benthic insects and crustaceans showing the strongest effects.  The density, biomass, and taxonomic richness of invertebrates dropped immediately following the cold event and remained depressed.  In contrast, fish communities displayed temporary declines in density but rebounded rapidly to pre-cold event levels, suggesting that use of thermal refugia in more temperature stable locations such as deep holes allowed them to weather the event.  Declines in benthic invertebrates were long-lasting and those communities had not recovered 8 months later, a more severe response than was observed for hurricane impacts on these same streams several years earlier.  The project provided support and training for a post-doctoral researcher, a PhD student, and a technician and also suppported the creation of a new course given at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science on cold event disturbance ecology.  Results of the work were presented at several conference venues and within invited departmental seminars at four academic institutions.  Reporting of the work in the form of peer reviewed publications is currently in process with one manuscript in review and another being prepared for submission.  Overall this work provides an important case study in the understudied field of cold event disturbance and elevates our recognition of these events.  Importantly and counter-intuitively, cold events driven by polar air outbreaks like this one may be come more frequent with global climate, at the same time that mean temperatures are increasing and encouraging tropicalizaiton of southern temperate areas of the world.  We must better understand the short and long-term consequences of these events to better prepare for the new climate regimes that are developing worldwide. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher J Patrick"
