This project aims to broaden understanding of the Langlands program and related questions.\r\n\r\nThe research focuses on the following topics: (1) new instances of the global Langlands correspondence for the groups GSp(2n), GSO(2n), and SO(2n);  (2) a full stable trace formula for Igusa varieties and applications; (3) local harmonic analysis questions on supercuspidal representations such as invariant dimensions; and (4) a completion of the endoscopic classification for non-quasi-split unitary groups. The results of this research will stimulate further progress and inspire new investigations. Graduate students will be supported to take part in these projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
