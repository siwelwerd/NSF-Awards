 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Redshirt model is an alternative pathway for low-income, academically talented students, who want to pursue degrees and careers in engineering, computer science, science and mathematics, but need a stronger base of preparation. The model is based on Redshirt programs in athletics, in which a first year college student is given a year to prepare to compete at the university level. With evidence of the success of the Redshirt model in engineering across a set of research universities, this conference project will contribute to meeting the national need for engineers, computer scientists, and scientists by offering an opportunity to examine, implement, and investigate the implementation of the model at a broader array of institutions of higher education beyond research-intensive ones. The model also focuses on First-Time Full-Time students.  \r\n\r\nThe conference will engage participants in the development and planned implementation of the model at their institutions. Organizers will leverage the experience of the Redshirt project team in establishing and maintaining the comprehensive model at six research  universities. The conference agenda is driven by best practices and includes sessions on collaboration; key components of the model; mastery of STEM basics; intrusive advising; community building; study skills; student personal and professional development; partnering with industry; fund-raising; sustainability; and evaluation.  A robust mixed-methods evaluation complements the comprehensive activities that are planned.  The selection of participants will be based on commitment to establishing a Redshirt program at their institutions and on fostering the Redshirt model at a diverse set of institution (e.g., types, size, location).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
