 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project examines how teachers\u2019 culturally supportive mathematics instructional practices engage and shape adolescents\u2019 brain networks in ways that predict their math identity, achievement, and sense of purpose over time. The investigator also will assess the neurophysiology of how critical consciousness develops in mathematics teachers. The project synthesizes neurobiological, developmental, and culturally situated perspectives to explore adolescents\u2019 and teachers\u2019 socio-emotional cognition in secondary mathematics classrooms. The project includes a professional development plan that will enable the investigator to receive disciplinary and research methodological training from a collaborating partner to ultimately create an asset-based cultural neuroscientific approach that is inclusive of the experiences of diverse and underserved youth. The training will be conducted in collaboration with the Center for Affective Neuroscience, Development, Learning and Education at the University of Southern California. The project will forge new discovery on adolescent thinking as well as teacher thinking and how those beliefs position them to better support students. \r\n\r\nThe investigator will use observational methods to examine concrete and abstract processing opportunities in secondary math classrooms in conjunction with physiological and neuroimaging methods of adolescents recounting their experience of these classes to make meaning of the content. The research aims to (1) understand the multiple instructional attributes of teaching mathematics for transcendent purpose, and observe when and under what conditions mathematics teachers are leveraging those multiple instructional techniques; (2) assess the psychophysiology and neural networks at play when adolescent students recall their experiences of these classes and the meaning of mathematics they derived from them; and (3) assess the psychophysiology and neural networks at play through teachers\u2019 explanations of why and how they teach mathematics for transcendent purpose. The investigator will use the Belonging-Centered Instruction observational protocol, the investigator will evaluate videoed classrooms using state space grid analysis to study the co-occurrence of distinct instructional phenomena within a two-dimensional space. Participants will be recruited from mathematics classrooms in Ohio, New York, and the Algebra Project. The combination of observational and neuroimaging methods can elucidate the link between teacher pedagogy and student cognition and address practical questions regarding how teachers can best position students to recognize and create big picture messages in math and for themselves.  The project will allow the investigator to explore the social cognitive qualities of math classrooms and teacher pedagogy to understand how teachers synthesize concrete processing, abstract thought, and student affect into high-quality mathematics instruction.  \r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Mid-Career Advancement program that supports opportunities for scientists and engineers to advance and enhance their research program through synergistic and mutually beneficial partnerships.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This initiative emphasizes the importance of culturally responsive teaching and critical thinking, aiming to boost feelings of belonging and positive identity development in teenagers. It's all about creating learning experiences that are meaningful and connected to students' lives, which is especially important for kids who may face racism at school or in society. Here&rsquo;s a look at how this research and its activities are impacting both academic scholarship and real-world educational practices.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Intellectual &amp; Real-World Impact</strong></p>\r\n<p>For many students of color, school can sometimes feel like a challenging place due to racial stigmas that affect their sense of belonging and academic confidence. Culturally responsive teaching is one approach that can help, but it's often not put into practice enough. This project looks at why these teaching methods are effective, even down to how they impact brain activity, helping students engage more deeply with their learning. By understanding these processes, educators can support students in making sense of the world around them and their place in it.</p>\r\n<p>The broader implications of this research manifest in two main arenas: enhanced STEM education and enriched youth-focused mentorship and community outreach programs. By utilizing research findings, teacher educators can better train mathematics teachers in cultural competence, facilitating improvements in the teaching of culturally diverse students. Furthermore, the research supports the development of youth programs that promote character building, racial understanding, and math skills among historically marginalized children of color. This creates a beneficial cycle where research on adolescent engagement in mathematics informs and is informed by community initiatives.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Belonging as Legacy</strong></p>\r\n<p>The program \"Belonging as Legacy,\" orchestrated by Matthews and Immordino-Yang, exemplifies the real-world application of this educational research. High school students engaged in storytelling and video production workshops to explore personal and ancestral narratives, which culminated in a film festival showcasing their autobiographical works. These activities empower students by grounding their learning in storytelling&mdash;a powerful medium for self-expression and identity formation, particularly in the context of belonging and legacy.</p>\r\n<p>The program highlighted the emotional and intellectual growth participants experienced, transforming their understanding of legacy from a source of pressure to an opportunity for empowerment and self-creation. By engaging with this curriculum, students were encouraged to delve deeply into their identities and experiences, foregrounding personal and community narratives that reflect their diverse backgrounds.</p>\r\n<p>The broader impact of these efforts is significant. By rethinking what and how we teach, focusing on identity and community, this initiative points towards a more inclusive and culturally aware educational system. These changes not only benefit individual students but also aim to reshape education to better address social and racial inequities. In doing so, educators can foster a more resilient and thoughtful society, where everyone feels that they belong and can contribute.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/10/2025<br>\nModified by: Jamaal&nbsp;Sharif&nbsp;Matthews</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2133996/2133996_10766326_1744297870349_USC_RSE_Belonging_as_Legacy_CANDLE_20240429_0030--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2133996/2133996_10766326_1744297870349_USC_RSE_Belonging_as_Legacy_CANDLE_20240429_0030--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Esther Govea Debriefs with Student\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2133996/2133996_10766326_1744297870349_USC_RSE_Belonging_as_Legacy_CANDLE_20240429_0030--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Esther Govea Debriefs with Student\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Govea speaks with a student in the program during a classroom session, which took place at USC's University Park Campus.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">(Photo/Rebecca Aranda)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jamaal&nbsp;Sharif&nbsp;Matthews\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Esther Govea Debriefs with Student</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2133996/2133996_10766326_1744298009175_USC_RSE_Belonging_as_Legacy_CANDLE_20240429_0027--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2133996/2133996_10766326_1744298009175_USC_RSE_Belonging_as_Legacy_CANDLE_20240429_0027--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Jamaal Matthews, PI University of Michigan\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2133996/2133996_10766326_1744298009175_USC_RSE_Belonging_as_Legacy_CANDLE_20240429_0027--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Jamaal Matthews, PI University of Michigan\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">University of Michigan Education Professor Jamaal Sharif Matthews, who serves as principal investigator for the CANDLE project, attends a classroom session of Belonging as Legacy program</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rebecca Aranda</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jamaal&nbsp;Sharif&nbsp;Matthews\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Jamaal Matthews, PI University of Michigan</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2133996/2133996_10766326_1744298152708_USC_RSE_Belonging_as_Legacy_CANDLE_20240429_0016--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2133996/2133996_10766326_1744298152708_USC_RSE_Belonging_as_Legacy_CANDLE_20240429_0016--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Trey Dyson, undergrad film study at USC\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2133996/2133996_10766326_1744298152708_USC_RSE_Belonging_as_Legacy_CANDLE_20240429_0016--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Trey Dyson, undergrad film study at USC\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Trey Dyson, an undergrad student studying creative writing and creative arts, assisted Esther Govea in the classroom.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rebecca Aranda</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jamaal&nbsp;Sharif&nbsp;Matthews\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Trey Dyson, undergrad film study at USC</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2133996/2133996_10766326_1744297764322_USC_RSE_Belonging_as_Legacy_CANDLE_20240429_0071--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2133996/2133996_10766326_1744297764322_USC_RSE_Belonging_as_Legacy_CANDLE_20240429_0071--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mary Helen Immordino-Yang\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2133996/2133996_10766326_1744297764322_USC_RSE_Belonging_as_Legacy_CANDLE_20240429_0071--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Helen Immordino-Yang\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mary Helen Immordino-Yang, director of CANDLE, hopes programs like Belonging as Legacy will help change the way scientists study human development.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rebecca Aranda</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jamaal&nbsp;Sharif&nbsp;Matthews\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mary Helen Immordino-Yang</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
