 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to scale a renewable technology.  The proposed system uses renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into value-added chemicals with the only byproduct being oxygen. This approach has the potential to make chemicals and fuels that consume and prevent greenhouse gas emissions. Unique to this process is production of the world\u2019s first carbon-negative alcohols. These can be used as feedstock for materials including consumer goods, bioplastics, and fuel, both more sustainably and at a cost potentially lower than any other technologies in use today. The system\u2019s most critical component is a proprietary catalyst that transforms carbon dioxide into alcohols, namely ethanol, using only earth-abundant elements and avoiding the use of precious metals. This SBIR project will focus on significantly improving these earth-abundant catalysts to reduce the cost of sustainable chemical production. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR project proposes to make transformative improvements to heterogeneous catalyst efficiency and yield for ethanol production. In doing so, it will improve understanding of how carbon dioxide interacts with the metals in novel heterogeneous catalysts. The new industrial chemical process produces ethanol from carbon dioxide in a single step. This process produces the first and only lifecycle carbon-negative ethanol to date, with the potential to be more energy efficient than legacy and state-of-the-art renewable ethanol processes.  The proposed novel catalysts enable new conversion phenomena not observed previously, which presents a challenge toward improving and scaling catalyst production. This project will study variants of the catalyst under varied pressure, temperature, flow rate, and other conditions along with chemical characterization to better understand how carbon dioxide and hydrogen bind to the catalyst surface. This data will be used to iterate and improve rate and selectivity toward production of USP grade ethanol.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We are source-agnostic as a CO<sub>2</sub> utilization company, but ultimately plan to source our CO<sub>2</sub> using direct air capture (diagram showing process flows shown in Fig. 1).

Since the beginning of Phase 1, we have tested our existing catalyst under varying conditions, such as varied temperatures, pressures, and flow conditions, to understand their performance at our pilot-scale facility (reactor skid shown in Fig. 2). Additionally, we have improved and streamlined our bench-scale testing capabilities to synthesize, screen and identify best performing catalysts faster (photograph of synthesis underway in Fig. 3). Based on the data we collected form large- and small-scale testing and as a direct outcome of the SBIR funding, we have subsequently synthesized and further screened over 50 catalysts (exemplary catalyst shown in Fig. 4).

The outcome of this research has demonstrated that our novel catalysts show catalytic phenomenon that have not yet been reported in the literature, and we plan to report our findings in scientific journals in the near future. Based on the outcomes of Phase 1, we continue our efforts to gain further mechanistic understanding of catalysts and to optimize our process by targeting specific products streams (e.g., jet fuel) that would allow us to make significant impact to advance carbon capture and utilization technologies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this funding period, we have hired and trained technical staff and more than quadrupled the outcome of our synthetic and testing capabilities.

In addition to our contribution to advancing scientific research to improve carbon conversion efficiency and yields, Air Company is also committed to participating in efforts to bring awareness pertaining to global climate issues to our consumers. We continue to bring awareness through our targeted campaigns to educate our consumers about climate change issues as well as how we are combating it through our processes and products. Inspired to support our community in a time of great need at the height of the COVID-19 lockdown, we had pivoted to producing and donating carbon negative hand sanitizers to hospitals and essential services in New York City in 2020.
