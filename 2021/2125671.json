 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in a sustainable fashion.  The proposed system can manage MSW without generating toxic air emissions, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 98% compared to landfills and incineration. An additional benefit is that waste does not need to be separated, thereby promoting recycling of glass and metal, as they are left untreated.  In addition, the technology is envisioned to be  affordable and easily deployed to enable on-site treatment, saving transportation costs and associated impact. Finally, the system has the potential to use excess heat to generate electricity and use the by-product effectively. This system promotes a circular economy and supports multiple benefits to the environment.\r\n\r\nThis project advances development of a novel system of applying gas plasma to create thermal degradation of MSW.  Phase I objectives are to research, design, construct, and test a prototype and define an industrial-scale design. Tasks include testing functionality and emissions quality with a variety of waste feedstock and operational parameters, and conducting a life cycle analysis. Furthermore, the project will explore the co-generation of electricity and beneficial reuse of the ash by-product.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This technology enables municipal solid waste to be managed in a decentralized manner, avoiding the expense and negative environmental impact of long-distance transportation. The zero-fuel Phoenix is very cost effective as the only inputs are water, filtration media and labor to operate the machine. Amortizing the cost of the machine over 4 years, waste disposal cost is estimated at $20/ton which is half of the cheapest landfill tipping fees in the US. Heat from the water scrubber can be utilized to generate 106.7KWe of electricity, with a potential 5 to 10-fold increase if utilizing direct heat from the furnace. The ash byproduct has beneficial reuse as a construction material or soil amendment. Glass and metal are not destroyed by the process and can be retrieved from the ash chamber for recycling, reducing the costly process of separation. These circular economy benefits help increase the economic competitiveness of the U.S. recycling and waste management industry.</p>\n<p>The potential applications are widespread from use in communities, waste transfer stations, island nations, disaster debris clean up, USDA regulated waste, and the military are just a few examples of practical applications of this technology. The key is for waste generators in developed countries to take ownership of how their waste is handled, choosing a cleaner climate solution and generating electricity in the process. In underdeveloped countries where waste handling infrastructure is often not present this solution becomes a quick cost-effective green solution that may be implemented immediately.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/08/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Tamara&nbsp;R&nbsp;Webb</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2125671/2125671_10754258_1683574396345_projectoutcomereportImage1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2125671/2125671_10754258_1683574396345_projectoutcomereportImage1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Phoenix Unit\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2125671/2125671_10754258_1683574396345_projectoutcomereportImage1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Phoenix Unit\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image 1 is a picture of the Phoenix Unit measuring 8.5 ft x 8.5 ft x 15 ft roughly the size of a van such that it may be easily deployed to locations where waste is generated.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yuen Chan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tamara&nbsp;R&nbsp;Webb</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Phoenix Unit</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2125671/2125671_10754258_1683574727988_projectoutcomereportImage2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2125671/2125671_10754258_1683574727988_projectoutcomereportImage2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Phoenix Trial Waste Reduction\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2125671/2125671_10754258_1683574727988_projectoutcomereportImage2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Phoenix Trial Waste Reduction\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Phoenix processed the contents in the 30-yard dumpster (shown In Image 2) in 9 hours and reduced it down to the waste seen in those trays.
