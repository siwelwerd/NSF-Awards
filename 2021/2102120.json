 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants require proper hydration status regardless of environmental conditions. Despite this fundamental property of plant life, the genetic and molecular processes responsible for regulating plant water status are not fully understood. This lack of knowledge limits the ability to develop crops that can thrive with less water or are able to withstand climatic extremes. This project seeks to address this knowledge gap by combining physiological and molecular trait data with computational approaches to reveal the mechanism(s) responsible for controlling plant water status. Cotton, the world\u2019s most important fiber crop, will be used to study how gene expression relates to quantifiable changes in key, stress-adaptive plant traits responsible for ensuring growth and productivity under drought conditions. Using these data, a computational model will be developed to simulate cotton growth in response to environmental and soil water conditions so that various combinations of plant traits can be tested in silico to predict how plants may perform under a variety of conditions. This project will provide data and tools to help identify and quantify the genetic mechanisms responsible for conferring drought adaptation. Information gained can be used by the broader community for crop improvement and managing water resources \u2013 a critical aspect as agriculture is threatened by reduced water availability. The tools and techniques will also be integrated into undergraduate research opportunities to help provide training and education for the next generation of scientists to combat crop insecurity due to existential threats posed by climate change. \r\n\r\nThe genetic mechanisms that control and regulate water movement in crop plants is poorly understood, limiting the ability to enhance crop resiliency under water limited conditions. This knowledge gap exists because the methods for characterizing genotype-specific drought resistance traits are time and labor intensive and do not scale to genetically informative populations. Additionally, current methods to quantify the functional connections between genotypic variation and altered physiological performance on a temporal basis in response to fluctuating environmental conditions are severely lacking. One approach to bridge this gap is the use of biophysical process-based models (BPMs), which simulate complex systems based on fundamental physical, chemical, and biological theory. This project aims to address the lack of knowledge surrounding the genetic mechanisms controlling plant water dynamics by: 1) determining the temporal dynamics of molecular and phenotypic responses characterized by transcriptional and biophysical mechanisms in plants grown under drought conditions; 2) utilizing these data to develop a BPM capable of simulating genotype-specific parameters that capture acclimation response to water limitation; and 3) uncovering the genetic basis of drought resistance in cotton by using model-derived phenotypes that represent the physiological processes regulating water balance in cotton. In sum, our proposal seeks to close the genotype-to-phenotype gap for drought resistance to improve crop resiliency while providing a paradigm for dissecting stress-adaptive traits in crop plants.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
