 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). \r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to examine entrepreneurship among minority communities and identify how success varies for individuals who experience discrimination. The proposed research utilizes interviews and focus groups to better understand the factors that shape the success or failure of entrepreneurial ventures among entrepreneurs of color and the ways in which discrimination shapes the pursuit of independent business ventures. This study will also evaluate how individuals understand their entrepreneurship as part of their larger social environment and as a strategy for change. Findings from this project will be useful to policymakers as well as to organizations seeking to support entrepreneurship within marginalized communities. This project will create opportunities for collaboration within minority-serving institutions, provide opportunities for minority students and community members to build research capacity through training and experience, and promote examples of the resilience of minority entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will conduct interviews and focus groups with key informants to construct case studies of minority entrepreneurs and their businesses. Qualitative data will be collected from multiple racial-ethnic communities on the practices and experiences of minority entrepreneurs, and on the extent to which social, legal and racial forms of discrimination shape the process and success of their entrepreneurial ventures. Results will contribute to the theoretical understandings of how individual and environmental factors affect the development of entrepreneurial ventures and shed light on the relationship between entrepreneurship and social mobility.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over the course of three years we successfully collected a detailed data set that will provide opportunities for analysis and theory development about these issues for years to come: we ultimately conducted and recorded 107 individual interviews and 6 focus groups, including 27 focus group members. We also conducted ethnographic observation at over 40 events.&nbsp; We have been analyzing our data using sociological and entrepreneurial literatures to inform an empirical exploration of the&nbsp;ways marginalized&nbsp;groups cohere and mobilize in the face of exclusion to develop new business ventures.&nbsp;Overall, our results showed that those entrepreneurs from marginalized race-ethnic identities who narrate persistence and growth were constantly juggling their identities and had the ability to invisibilize, camouflage, and leverage their race-ethnicity in adaptive response to the context depending on how discriminatory or open the context is to their identities. We identified the characteristics that allow entrepreneurs to adapt to a dynamic and persistent environment of adversity: early experiences of socialization in White/diverse environments, internal sources of confidence, and the ability to brush off discrimination. Furthermore, our findings showed that most of the entrepreneurs we interviewed did not start their businesses because they had been totally excluded from the labor market, but they did feel a lack of esteem for their knowledge and expertise, limited possibilities for professional progress, and a desire to shed the limitations imposed upon them by discriminatory social and professional environments. For most of the entrepreneurs we interviewed, the income made through their business was not their sole source of income, often complementing formal employment; and many described incurring debt or just breaking even with their businesses. They described how entrepreneurship became a space for personal expression by creating new rules, structures and relationships that allowed them to create an enterprise according to their views and ideals.
