 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project responds to a June 9, 2021, wildfire that burned 283 hectares of the 999-ha Jacks Valley Wildlife Management Area (WMA) in south Carson City, Nevada. It explores soil erosion processes occurring subsequent to fires induced by cheat grass invasion. It will quantity the factors influencing wind and water erosion using modern instruments, including terrestrial laser scanner, unmanned autonomous vehicle, ground penetrating radar, and satellite imagery. The project team includes members of groups historically underrepresented in science. Students will be supported on the project through paid internships that leverage existing programs at the University of Nevada, Reno, and connections with federal partners. The data generated could be useful to tribal communities whose lands are at high risk to degradation. \r\n\r\nBuilding on an established United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) study, this project addresses a critical knowledge gap in our fundamental understanding of wind and water erosion rates in dryland landscapes that are undergoing abrupt change. The wildfire event that is the focus of this study presents a time-sensitive opportunity to collect perishable data on the wind- and water- driven soil erosion that occurs subsequent to fires induced by increased cheatgrass fuel loads in sagebrush steppe. The investigators will address research questions related to the relative contribution to the annual sediment budget of various factors influencing erosion. These factors will be quantified using terrestrial laser scanning, unmanned aerial vehicles, ground penetrating radar, and satellite imagery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

JVWMA is within the Great Basin ecosystem and the Basin &amp; Range physiographic province and sits upon a bajada that supports cheatgrass (<em>Bromus tectorum</em>) invaded sagebrush steppe plant community on excessively drained gravelly loamy coarse sandy soils. The fire had burned a grazing exclosure that was part of a 5-year USFS study that aimed to reduce fine fuels in cheatgrass-invaded shrublands using targeted livestock grazing.This &ldquo;natural experiment&rdquo; addressed knowledge gaps in dryland research specifically, what are the sedimentation rates from wind and water erosion in the Great Basin? We also investigated differences in soil moisture and through undergraduate research soil infiltration, and belowground biomass on burned and unburned sites using airborne drones with multispectral cameras, terrestrial laser scanners (TLS), ground penetrating radar (GPR), and drone and satellite remote sensing.<strong></strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>The JVWMA 2021 wildfire presented an opportunity to address this knowledge gap in drylands. We established 15 sample plots for the measurement of wind and water erosion sedimentation rates in 2022 using silt fences for the measurement of water erosion and Modified Wilson &amp; Cook (MWAC) and Big Spring Number Eight (BSNE) sensors for wind erosion. We found two to three orders of magnitude difference in wind erosion between the burned sites over ~1000 gm<sup>2 </sup>day<sup>-1</sup> and the unburned sites (~1 gm<sup>2 </sup>day<sup>-1</sup>).&nbsp; We found low aggregate soil stability on both the unburned and burned sites. In October 2021, we observed lower infiltration of water in burned areas particularly in the ash &ldquo;halos&rdquo; left by burned shrubs. However, contrary to our hypothesis of decreased infiltration in burn areas due to soil sealing, we found higher infiltration rates in he burned shrub&rsquo;s &ldquo;halos&rdquo; than in burned and unburned interspaces and below the canopy of unburned shrubs. This suggests a time limit to soil sealing. We used two TDR (time domain reflectometry) soil moisture sensors at 3 depths (15 cm, 30 cm, and 60 cm) over two years to compare between burned and unburned sites. We found the burned site consistently had higher soil moisture content than the unburned site at all 3 depths with the most soil moisture at 60-cm depth. The TDRs were also able to detect both precipitation and snow melt events. The amplitude reflections from the ground penetrating radar (GPR) are a surrogate measure for root biomass and the 4 collected transects suggest that the burned areas have greater belowground biomass than the unburned areas. We found from the NASA ECOSTRESS 3 X Met stations that were placed with the TDRs that the burned area had lower evapotranspiration than the unburned areas.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>This time-sensitive study has begun to address the water and wind erosion knowledge gap with the participation of a diverse community of stakeholders. The project is ongoing and led by an African American: Dr. Robert A. Washington-Allen who collaborates with the Dept. Chair Dr. Barry Perryman, an indigenous member of the Cherokee Nation. We also collaborate with the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the National Wind Erosion Network, the 3-D Erosion Modeling network, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and Dr. Scott Allen at UNR, a science team member for the NASA ECOSTRESS project aboard the International Space Station. This project benefits the Washoe Nation who have spring grazing rights within the JVWMA and have land that abuts the eastern side of the WMA as well as land due south. Our USFS study grazes 1000 head of sheep that are owned by a USFS permittee Mr. Ted Borda, a member of the large northern Nevada Basque community. The fire burned around the Jacks Valley Elementary School that serves the local and indigenous communities as well as south Carson City. We work with UNR&rsquo;s Cooperative Extension Program (UNCE) &ldquo;living with fire&rdquo;: <a href=\"https://www.livingwithfire.com/about/\">https://www.livingwithfire.com/about/</a> to collaborate with the school.<strong></strong></p>\n<p>Six graduate students (2 PhDs and 4 MS) assisted with this project.
