 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop and commercialize a fast charging battery which offers better safety with long cycle life compared to today\u2019s lithium (Li)-ion batteries. In traditional batteries, fast charging can cause the battery to become dangerously hot (more than 60\u00b0C/140\u00b0F) and reduce the life of the battery to one or two charges. The proposed batteries utilize novel electrode materials that can be charged rapidly while generating no/little heat. Safe, fast-charging batteries have strong economic benefits for a variety of applications. Generally speaking, for mobile applications (cars, scooters, etc.), fast-charging batteries allows electrification of these devices by removing the main obstacle to acceptance - long charge times. For automated robots, power tools, and small electric vehicles, using the new generation batteries is expected to reduce the cost of ownership by increasing the battery life by at least a factor of 3. \r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project seeks to develop ultrafast charging batteries using mesoporous electrode materials. The materials are made into a sponge-like electrodes with the pores many times smaller than a human hair.  These sponge-like electrodes allow very close contact between the energy storage material and energy transport liquid, the electrolyte, decreasing ion transport distance.  The project will further develop the material into commercial fast charge batteries that allow: 1) charging in less than 10 minutes, 2) minimal heating upon fast charging, and 3) three times the cycle life compared to traditional Li-ion batteries. Additional effort will be put on process development to scale the materials production cost effectively.  Detailed performance studies at the better cell level will aid in understanding the effect of mesoporosity on fast-charging and heat generation using oxide nanostructured materials. These results will aid in the future development of high rate oxide materials in practical and fast charge Li-ion batteries with improved safety characteristics and minimized heat management requirements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
