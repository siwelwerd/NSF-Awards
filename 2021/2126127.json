 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create a sustainable film to keep food fresh in flexible packaging. This project advances the use of abundant woody biomass residue, typically drawn from residue from forestry, agriculture, or building demolition, for a new plastic film This bioplastic film will address global demand for lightweight, fresh food packaging that is environmentally sound. Vapor barrier, flexible packaging is a $30B/yr global market, and the US produces 1B tons/yr of woody biomass - ample to supply the global demand for high barrier packaging. \r\n\r\nThis project makes renewable, high barrier packaging from cellulose by deconstructing it to the sugar levoglucosan and then precisely re-polymerizing a nanostructured film with intrinsic strength, flexibility, temperature resistance, and vapor barrier properties. The innovation is biobased, poly(2,3)Glucose thermoplastic with intrinsic vapor barrier properties. Without laminations, crosslinks, or additives poly(2,3)Glucose biodegradable thermoplastic can be continuously recycled or decomposed in the environment. A recent breakthrough in the cost of pyrolyzing lignocellulose to levoglucosan makes levoglucosan cost competitive with fossil fuel feed stocks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These elastomers can be used as the cushioning material in sneaker soles. Fig. 1 illustrates the circular carbon economy enabled by this project. Biomass, typically from agricultural residues, is separated into its component cellulose and hemicellulose. These renewable biopolymers are converted to thermoplastic elastomer that is used to make foam rubber. The foam is molded into shoe soles and at the end of life it can be recycled. Any biomass that enters this carbon cycle removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>The cell wall comprises 90% of the plant dry weight and it is composed of three structural polymers: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Fig. 2 illustrates that up to 75% of the plant mass is cellulose and hemicellulose that can be used to make thermoplastic elastomers. The cell wall provides structural support for growing food, but the cell wall itself is inedible. After harvest, the agricultural residue is abundant and inexpensive. Some of the residue is fed to animals, most of it is burned or composted. For the first time, this NSF SBIR demonstrates that cellulose and hemicellulose can be converted to valuable thermoplastic elastomers. Cellulose and hemicellulose are the most abundant and among the most molecularly regular polymers on earth. This NSF SBIR chemically disassembles and reassembles these polysaccharides into 100% biorenewable thermoplastic elastomers using novel chemistry. Precise molecular control enables precise control over materials properties. This NSF SBIR demonstrates control over elastomer composition that translates to control over elastomer mechanical and thermal properties. Commercially competitive, 100% biorenewable thermoplastic elastomers are not achievable by other known approaches. The opportunity to use this chemistry to valorize agricultural waste, and to leverage the molecular regularity of polysaccharides is great.</p>\n<h1>Broader Impacts:</h1>\n<p>Many consumer-facing products are cushioning foams, like sneaker midsoles. Thermoplastic elastomers are meltable, stretchy polymers used to make high performance consumer foams. Market penetration of incumbent bio-based thermoplastic elastomer is ~5% because they cost 1.3-2x petroleum-based thermoplastic elastomers and because only 30-60% of the carbon is bio-based. Competitive value, 100% biorenewable footwear foam is an unmet need in a $4.3B/yr market. This NSF SBIR Ph I innovation is the basis for greening footwear at existing unit pricing while improving shoe durability, weight, and resilience. Just as petrochemical plastics stand on the shoulders of the energy industry, biorenewable plastics will stand on the shoulders of the agricultural industry. Agricultural residue at &lt;$0.2/kg, can compete with crude oil at $0.6/kg ($84/barrel). The next Green Revolution valorizes agricultural residues by converting them to high performance elastomers. Domestic agricultural residues contain enough carbon to make soles for the 23 billion pairs of shoes made globally every year. Sustainability is a three-legged stool. Fig. 3 represents the environmental, social, and economic sustainability that follow from reduced carbon intensity and oil dependence, improved rural economy, and increased value in footwear promised by thermoplastic elastomers made from cellulose and hemicellulose.</p>\n<h1>Phase I Outcomes</h1>\n<p>In Ph I of this NSF SBIR, we synthesized and characterized 100% biorenewable thermoplastic elastomers from materials derivable from non-food biomass, cellulose and hemicellulose. Fig. 4 shows 21x elongation of a polymer sample. In addition to elastic properties these polymers have an operating temperature range of -75C to 177 C, and a melting temperature of 206 C. This NSF Ph I SBIR is the first report of a 100% biorenewable thermoplastic elastomer with unique control over melting and glass transition temperatures, and a low cost, scalable path from agricultural residue to sustainability.</p>\n<p>Fig. 5 shows the greenhouse gas contribution on a mass basis for the NSF elastomer and for ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). EVA is the dominant incumbent polymer for shoe midsole foam. Plants convert atmospheric carbon into cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. When the plant dies and decays the carbon returns to the air. When the plant dies and it is converted to shoe soles, the carbon is sequestered in the shoes. A life cycle that includes carbon sequestration is called cradle to grave; without sequestration the life cycle is cradle to gate. The NSF elastomer represents a 128% reduction in carbon footprint compared to EVA on a cradle to grave basis. The reduction in carbon footprint is greater than unity because the biorenewable elastomer is carbon negative, it removes carbon from the biosphere.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/03/2024<br>\nModified by: Alexander&nbsp;Gorkovenko</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2126127/2126127_10760270_1704260333574_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2126127/2126127_10760270_1704260333574_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Woody Biomass\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2126127/2126127_10760270_1704260333574_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Woody Biomass\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 2.
