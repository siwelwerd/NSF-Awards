 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of technology to assist the general public, military, first responders, and medical professionals with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).  For over 25 years, guidelines for chest compressions during CPR have relied on compressing an arrest victim\u2019s chest a set amount of inches and gauging this depth by the naked eye.  The goal is to sharpen these guidelines by making available easy-to-use technology that guides the rescuer and provides real-time feedback about their CPR performance.  By improving critical performance metrics, the proposed technology may improve survival of cardiac arrest both in and out of the hospital.  \r\n \r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of ultrasound technology that has been streamlined and specifically purposed to detect blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).  By tracking blood flow through target blood vessels, the proposed technology is designed to provide users with specific instructions and real-time metrics about the performance of their CPR.  The goal is to improve chest compressions, which may lead to greater blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain, heart, and other vital organs.  The proposed technology has been validated by initial pilot studies aimed at comparing the proposed technology to the current invasive blood pressure monitoring during controlled cardiac arrest.  Future development may improve the focus and function of the technology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
