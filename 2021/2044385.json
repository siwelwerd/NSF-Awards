 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by educating biology students in the application, use, and ethics of a novel gene editing technology.  Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) technology has emerged as a rapid and easy to use gene editing technique.  CRISPR technology, which was recognized with a Nobel Prize in 2020, is making an impact in medicine, agriculture, food production, public policy, and business, as well as in popular media.  Given the broad reach of CRISPR, there is an increased need and urgency for undergraduate students to learn about and consider how to use the technology appropriately.  The project plans to build instructional modules on CRISPR technology for both introductory and advanced biology students.  These modules will be designed to create curricular experiences that are novel, relevant, and accessible for students as well as to increase faculty understanding of CRISPR technology.  By implementing these modules with both STEM and non-STEM majors, this work should help develop informed citizens who can confront the societal implications of CRISPR and other gene editing technologies.  \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the proposed project is to develop, implement, and evaluate both dry-lab and wet-lab educational experiences framed around gene editing using CRISPR.  The toolkit to be developed in the project will include a series of dry-lab Case-Based Learning modules that focus on CRISPR editing of genes and that will engage students through computer-based DNA sequence analysis, manipulation, and modeling.  Wet-lab experiences will include a Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience that is framed around using CRISPR technology in painted lady butterflies to study butterfly wing and body patterning and development.  Bioethical training will be built into both curricular activities to promote the students\u2019 understanding of the societal implications of gene editing.  The project team will evaluate the impacts of the new curricula on student learning, scientific design and process skills, ethical reasoning, and post-course attitudes and activities.  The project is intended to provide broad training and support of educators by disseminating curricular materials and approaches through virtual instructional workshops, conference presentations, publications, and the development of a community of practice for CRISPR technology educators.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
