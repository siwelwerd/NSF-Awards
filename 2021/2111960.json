 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commerical potential of this I-Corps project involves the use of brochosome-inspired coatings for optical, energy, and sustainability applications. Brochosomes are intricately structured microscopic granules secreted by insects and typically found on their body surface.  The proposed brochosome-inspired coating technology could be integrated into camera or sensing devices to suppress stray reflections and to further enhance the sensor sensitivity. In addition, the brochosome-inspired coating could be engineered and incorporated onto solar panels to enhance optical transmission to improve solar energy harvesting. The antireflective coating could also be applied onto glass and window surfaces to improve energy efficiency of buildings, in addition to serving as a bird-friendly coating to reduce bird collisions for environmental sustainability. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on a brochosome-inspired optical coating characterized by three-dimensional, hierarchical micro- and nanostructures to suppress reflection from ultraviolet to near-infrared light at different incident angles. The proposed technology has demonstrated that brochosome-inspired coatings can be applied onto various surfaces and can prevent reflection of ultraviolet to near infrared light by as much as ~99%. The antireflective performances of the brochosomes-inspired coating can be tailored by engineering the geometries of the micro- and nanostructures suitable for various optical applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
