 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many essential biological processes in humans and plants are controlled by protein molecules. This project will uncover how protein molecules are organized in order to control the growth of tissues.  When two-thirds of a rat\u2019s liver is removed, the remaining one-third will grow back to its normal size - How does the liver know when to stop growing? This complex but well-coordinated process starts with physical interactions between specific protein molecules. When these interactions go awry, it can lead to various disease conditions. This research will uncover the molecular processes that drive these physical interactions. The project will also facilitate the training of undergraduate and graduate students, especially underrepresented minorities, in cutting-edge research, engage high school students in basic scientific research, and increase public scientific literacy through programs at a local science museum.\r\n\r\nProtein complexes that play a crucial role in the homeostasis balance between cell growth and cell death are enriched in disordered segments and typically assemble via multivalent interactions to form dynamic ensembles. This project will test the idea that the valency of the core scaffold protein in the complex influences the stability and equilibrium distribution of the dynamic ensemble. Specifically, the research will use a suite of molecular biophysics methods to elucidate the structure, dynamics, and protein-protein interactions within select regulatory complexes. In collaboration with an accomplished investigator in the field of theoretical biophysics, the experimental molecular biophysics data will be integrated with physical theories and computational simulations to extract microscopic interacting parameters to build a more comprehensive understanding of the regulatory complexes and provide a generalized framework for modeling dynamic ensembles in protein interacting networks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
