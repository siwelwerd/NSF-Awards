 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to develop a reliable chemical field test that can easily and quickly differentiate between hemp and marijuana plants in the field. A miniaturized testing platform results in improved sensitivity and effectiveness.  This technology addresses a need to differentiate plants quickly and effectively for use by law enforcement, regulatory bodies, and also by the hemp growing industry. This PFI-TT project will accelerate the commercialization of a viable solution that will compete favorably with an existing technology and incorporate engineering expertise to address the scaling challenges to commercialize the rapid test kit.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project seeks to use a polymer-coated fiberglass substrate and a robust chemical reaction to provide miniaturized reaction results. The major technical challenge in the commercialization of the rapid test kit is the development of a prototype that can be industrially scalable for various market segments. In order to address the technical challenges, the team will validate the prototype kit with industry partners and standardize a versatile platform that is commercially viable and that can address various market segments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
