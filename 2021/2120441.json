 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global change is rapidly altering many tropical ecosystems with little understanding of how those changes impact the characteristics of those ecosystems and the services they provide. An important force in this change is the increase in hurricane frequency and intensity. In November of 2020, two hurricanes (Eta and Iota) moved from the Caribbean basin to across the Honduran mainland in quick succession. Each hurricane generated massive rainfall as it downgraded to a tropical storm and flooded the Sula Valley in north-central Honduras. Lake Yojoa, located in north central Honduras, the only natural lake in Honduras, has been home to human populations for > 4000 years, and as such, carries an important sense of place for many Hondurans. Addressing challenges of global freshwater sustainability requires an intimate understanding of ecosystems from across the globe. This RAPID will assess how the increasingly frequent massive rainfall events caused by the recent hurricanes impacts tropical aquatic ecosystems by altering the physical dynamics and water chemistry of tropical lakes and the watersheds that sustain them.\r\n\r\nThis RAPID represents a unique opportunity to close knowledge gaps at the intersection of three deficits in the current understanding of freshwater ecosystems. First, tropical lakes that experience stratification and mixus are understudied compared to their temperate counterparts. Second, lake ecosystems are rarely considered in the context of the watersheds within which they reside. Third, in order to fully understand the impact of global change on aquatic ecosystems, time-series data that can distinguish between intra-annual and inter-annual variability are necessary. This project addresses the impact of two large hurricanes on a monomictic tropical lake in Central America (Lake Yojoa) and its watershed. In doing so, it provides the opportunity to a) advance our understanding of the biogeochemistry of tropical monomictic lakes, b) identify key linkages between watershed-derived-allochthonous nutrient delivery and internal lake biogeochemical dynamics and c) identify the impact of hurricanes on tropical watersheds and the lakes they contain. By rapidly deploying a lake and watershed sampling design and comparing contemporary dynamics to analyses conducted previous to the hurricanes, this RAPID will advance our understanding of these important knowledge gaps within the context of the current understanding of tropical freshwater ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project has created a first-time formal research collaboration between Zamorano University and Colorado State University. PI- Hall has worked in Honduras for close to two decades including a stint in 2013 as a Fulbright Fellow hosted by Zamorano University. However, the majority of the other in-country collaborative efforts have been with the non-profit AMUPROLAGO which is PI-Hall&rsquo;s key collaborator on Lake Yojoa. Interacting across disciplines (Co-PI Tenorio is primarily a hydrologist and PI Hall is primarily an ecologist) and academic cultures (Honduran and U.S.) has been challenging and at the same time rewarding. This first year of the project created opportunities to learn how to better collaborate and improve the potential for the quality and speed of future collaborations. In addition to products and trainees (detailed in respective sections) PI Hall continues to provide an annual guest lecture to Co-PI Tenorio&rsquo;s class before their visit to Lake Yojoa. The Hall Laboratory also hosted Andrea Velez (a senior undergraduate at Zamorano University) for 3 months in the Spring of 2022. Andrea&rsquo;s research in the Hall lab was presented at the Multicultural Undergraduate Research, Art, and Leadership Symposium (MURALS) in April of 2023 where she was awarded first place in the STEM category for her research. Also, Jemma Fadum, a PhD student in the Hall laboratory who was in part supported by this award completed her PhD thesis in October of 2022. Dr. Fadum was awarded the Outstanding Thesis Award by the Warner College of Natural Resources (WCNR) at Colorado State University for her work.

In June of 2024 the large aquaculture operation had completely removed all net-pens (~140 in total) from Lake Yojoa. In January of 2024 secchi disc (a measurement of water clarity) in Lake Yojoa was ~3m (near the annual average for the past 5 years). By January of 2025 the secchi disc from Lake Yojoa was recorded at 7m. This shows a rapid shift in trophic state presumably due to the massive reduction in nutrient loading to the lake from the removal of net-pen aquaculture. Initially the massive water inputs from Eta and Iota (a &ldquo;flushing&rdquo;) resulted in a decrease in nutrients and an increase in secchi depth.
