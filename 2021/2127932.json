 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2021 Texas Winter Storm included the passage of three arctic fronts from 10 through 20 February. As numerous Texas counties faced record low temperatures, the independent electric grid for Texas nearly experienced a total collapse and more than 5 million people lost access to electricity. The cascading effects of this disaster included water service disruptions, boil-water advisories, communication and transportation disruptions, food shortages, and residential dislocation with implications for COVID-19 transmission and treatment. The purpose of this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to conduct a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the cascading impacts of the 2021 Texas Winter Storm on residents in eight metropolitan areas. Reliable assessment of household experiences is time-sensitive, and RAPID funding is enabling the collection of high quality, ephemeral data from affected households. The project will advance academic, practitioner, and public knowledge regarding factors influencing societal vulnerability to cascading disaster impacts during a pandemic which will be foundational to future efforts that seek to enhance resilience to such events nationwide. The project team will disseminate findings via multiple outlets, including by publishing articles in top-tier journals and delivering webinars to relevant stakeholder audiences. Additionally, findings will be shared via a website providing stakeholders, researchers, educators and other stakeholders with access to information about adverse impacts of the 2021 Texas Winter Storm. Through these channels, the project will extend societal benefits beyond the academic community.\r\n\r\nThis project applies a social vulnerability to disasters perspective to the 2021 Texas Winter Storm to advance knowledge of the socially uneven impacts of cascading disasters, and the disaster vulnerabilities experienced by subsidized rental housing residents. We will investigate the following research questions: (1) What cascading impacts did residents experience in response to the 2021 Texas Winter Storm? (2) How did cascading winter storm impacts differ based on social characteristics, housing status, electricity grid service provider (ERCOT vs. others), and metropolitan area? (3) How did the social characteristics of residents, their housing status, their electricity grid service provider, and the local physical attributes of the storm (e.g., temperature and precipitation) influence the cascading winter storm impacts they experienced? (4) How did the COVID-19 pandemic amplify the cascading effects of the winter storm on residents\u2019 well-being? The project involves a social survey conducted by cellular phone in English/Spanish with households in HUD-assisted multi-family housing and households residing in private (non-HUD-assisted) homes, in eight Texas metropolitan areas. By systematically examining the social, physical, and built environment determinants of this disaster\u2019s multifaceted effects\u2014based on comparisons between subsidized vs. private housing, residence within vs. outside the ERCOT grid, and across eight MSAs\u2014our project seeks to transform fundamental knowledge of social vulnerability to cascading infrastructure failure due to disasters. Additionally, it will advance knowledge regarding disaster vulnerabilities experienced by a socially disadvantaged and under-studied group\u2014residents of subsidized multi-family housing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Winter Storm Uri comprised three arctic fronts that lasted from February 10 to 20, 2021. As numerous Texas counties faced record low temperatures, the state's largest electric grid operator (Electric Reliability Council of Texas [ERCOT]) lost control of the power supply serving most of Texas, and more than five million people lost access to electricity. Around 70% of the Texas population was without power and 50% without running water at some point during this storm. Uri caused an estimated 130 billion (USD) in economic losses and hundreds of deaths statewide. The purpose of this project was to conduct a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the cascading impacts of Winter Storm Uri on residents of metropolitan Texas. It relied on collecting social survey data regarding households' experiences and analyzing data from this survey and other secondary sources. The survey underpinning this project was conducted by cellular phone in English and Spanish with 896 randomly selected households residing in counties that comprise eight Texas metropolitan areas: Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio, Austin, McAllen, El Paso, Beaumont-Port Arthur, and Lubbock. This included 147 households living in US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-assisted rental housing developments and 749 households residing in private (not HUD-assisted) homes.</p>\n<p>In terms of intellectual merit, this project has made important strides toward enhancing scientific knowledge of socially unequal impacts of cascading disasters and disaster vulnerabilities experienced by residents of federally subsidized rental housing, in particular. Previous studies of disaster impacts provide very limited knowledge of how cascading exposures and infrastructure failures may synergize to harm well-being and health for marginalized populations and how socially vulnerable communities can become more resilient to such extreme events. Additionally, only a few studies had focused on the adverse impacts experienced by federally subsidized rental housing residents, individuals who are particularly vulnerable across all phases of a disaster or extreme event. By systematically investigating the social, physical, and built environment determinants of the 2021 Winter Storm Uri's multifaceted effects--based on comparisons between subsidized multifamily vs. private housing, residence within vs. outside the ERCOT grid, and across eight metropolitan areas in Texas--our project findings are transforming fundamental knowledge of social vulnerability to cascading disasters. Additionally, our project is advancing knowledge regarding disaster vulnerabilities experienced by two disadvantaged and understudied groups: HUD-assisted rental housing residents and people with disabilities. Findings from our analyses of phone survey data reveal significant disparities in the adverse impacts of Winter Storm Uri (e.g., power/water outages, colder temperatures, post-traumatic stress, and levels of recovery) across metropolitan Texans based on minority racial/ethnic status, subsidized housing residency, and disability status. Project findings are also demonstrating how the COVID-19 pandemic amplified the cascading effects of this storm on residents' health and well-being, with disparate effects experienced by socially disadvantaged groups.</p>\n<p>In terms of broader impacts, project outcomes include enhanced public knowledge of community vulnerability to disasters and increased participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in hazards research. Project data and findings have been disseminated via multiple outlets.
