 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by studying the impact of low prerequisite proficiency on student success in computer science degree programs. It is a well-established fact that academia is not graduating enough students who are qualified to fill the growing employment needs in the technical workforce. In computer science, courses often require students to have completed preparatory courses called prerequisites. Little is known about the effect of variable prerequisite proficiency on student success in subsequent courses.  Surprisingly, despite strong grades in prerequisite courses, many students are judged to have poor prerequisite proficiency. This project will focus on answering three key questions: what the impact of low prerequisite proficiency is on student success in later courses, what are the causes of low prerequisite proficiency, and what is the extent of the problem. These findings will result in a better understanding of how prerequisite proficiency impacts student success, which will be used to improve computer science degree programs and increase the number of students qualified to fill employment needs in the technical workforce.\r\n\r\nStudies of student performance have shown that students from underrepresented groups in computing (e.g., women, minorities, transfer students, first-generation students) may be disproportionately impacted by low prerequisite proficiency.  The PIs will examine how students from groups underrepresented in computing are impacted relative to students from represented groups and will conduct a series of studies involving faculty and student interviews as well as designing and administering assessments of prerequisite preparation in multiple courses at each institution involved in the study.  Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, this multi-institutional project will determine the causes of low prerequisite preparation, the ubiquity of the problem, and the impact of low prerequisite preparation on student outcomes (exam scores, grades, retention). The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
