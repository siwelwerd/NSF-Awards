In a superconductor, electrons conduct electricity without any loss, but this typically happens only at low temperatures. As electrical loss represents a significant portion of all electrical bills, a room temperature superconductor would represent a major advance in power transmission. The PI's work is focused on understanding a class of high-temperature superconductors discovered in 1987 that have defied understanding within the so-called BCS theory proposed in 1957 by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer.  The primary difficulty is that while the BCS theory works fine for metals such aluminum where the interaction between the electrons can be ignored, this is not the case for the high-temperature superconductors where superconductivity occurs by doping materials which are insulators due to strong repulsion between electrons. The PI has advanced an exactly solvable model for such systems and shown how superconductivity emerges. Since the model is exactly solvable, a clear picture emerges as to how the BCS theory must be modified.  The PI will work to quantify the differences and construct the universal features of superconductivity in these materials that have defied description in terms of the standard BCS theory.\r\n\r\nThis award also supports training of graduate students seeking their PhD degrees in theoretical physics. The PI will be involved with other educational and outreach activities, such as continuing to revise his graduate textbook in theoretical solid state physics, serving on the Editorial Boards of prominent scientific journals, advancing initiatives within the American Physical Society at the intersection of physics and race, and working to increase diversity in the scientific workforce.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical research focused on new methods for the transport and superconducting properties of strongly correlated electron systems by using exactly solvable models, numerical calculations, and renormalization techniques to establish the existence of strongly coupled fixed points. The exactly solvable models allow new insight into the 35-year old problem of superconductivity in doped Mott insulators such as the high-temperature superconductors.  The goal is to ascertain what new features emerge from Mott physics in the superconducting state.  Another goal of the exactly solvable models is to determine if the physics they embody is governed by a new strongly coupled fixed point in much the same way Fermi liquid theory dictates the physics of simple metals.  Success here could provide an organizing principle in the physics of strongly correlated electron matter.  Finally, the focus on numerical calculations to determine the phase diagram of the dilute electron gas in the presence of a periodic potential is aimed at informing new experiments that have revealed novel insulating states that break translational symmetry in Moire bilayer systems.\r\n\r\nThis award also supports training of graduate students seeking their PhD degrees in theoretical physics. The PI will be involved with other educational and outreach activities, such as continuing to revise his graduate textbook in theoretical solid state physics, serving on the Editorial Boards of prominent scientific journals, advancing initiatives within the American Physical Society at the intersection of physics and race, and working to increase diversity in the scientific workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Consider the standard theory of metals in which a collection of electrons is assumed to act as they are entirely free avoiding all contact with their neighbours. Simply, the electrons can be thought of as filling energy levels (that form bands) and metallic behaviour obtains anytime some of the levels are empty. Applying a voltage tilts the band the the electrons populate the empty states, thereby yielding metallic conductivity. It turns out that this idealized picture of electrons in a metal accurately describes the electronic properties of all elemental metals. However, there are profound failures of the standard theory of metals. Consider for example the copper-oxide superconductors discovered in 1986 that violate the simple principle of the standard theory metals that partially filled electronic bands conduct electricity. In these materials, insulating behaviour obtains instead when the conduction band is half-filled. This behaviour cannot be understood unless interactions between the electrons are considered. When electrons interact, new collective states of matter form. Understanding these states cannot be done in terms of the starting building blocks, that is bare electron excitations. We have recently shown that new composite excitations formed from collection of electron and hole states comprise the basis for understanding insulating states in partially filled bands, known as Mott insulators. We have established for the first time that such composite states are stable under the standard material perturbations. This theory is now forming the basis for a theory for the superconducting state of the copper-oxide materials. What we have shown is that the superconducting state that obtains now has fundamentally different properties than those that form from cooling elemental metals.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have also shown that as a result of strong interactions, new states form in partially filled bands that result from a combination of the shape or topology of the bands interwined with the interactions. For example, in the newly evolving field of layering graphene sheets twisted relative to one another that new topological states can occur at quarter and three-quarter filling.  In the absence of interactions, such states only obtained at half-filling. Recent experiments confirm this prediction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is this all-encompassing command of the interplay between interactions and topology in quantum materials that we have been pioneering in the last funding period.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/04/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: PhilipWPhillips\n"
