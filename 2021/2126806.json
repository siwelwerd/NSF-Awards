The symposium will be hosted by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and will be held virtually between June 26 and June 30, 2021. The International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory is an important community forum with a scientific focus on numerical, and in particular lattice methods, used to study the properties of strongly interacting quantum systems. Particular emphasis will be placed on the study of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interactions in the Standard Model of particle physics. The conference typically attracts 500+ participants and offers opportunities to its participants for sharing scientific discoveries, as well a robust educational program for graduate and junior postdoctoral researchers, and public outreach events aimed at broadening participation in physics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
