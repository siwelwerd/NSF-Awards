 "awd_abstract_narration": "Supernova explosions play a central role in cosmology, astrophysics, and elementary particle physics. There is now solid experimental evidence of at least one supernova explosion within 300 light years of Earth within the last few million years, from measurements of the short-lived radioisotope iron-60 in widespread deep-ocean samples, as well as in the lunar regolith and in cosmic rays. This is the first established example of a specific dated astrophysical event outside the Solar System having a measurable impact on the Earth.  A research group at the University of Illinois will interpret these data as they systematically develop the astrophysics of this new field. The implications span much of astrophysics and beyond, informing topics including local supernova and star formation rates, the nature and history of the local environment of the Sun, cosmic-ray astrophysics, and even paleontology and biological mass extinctions.   The scientists are also dedicated to bringing their science to the public through multiple types of public outreach.\r\n\r\nThe research will involve a theoretical study to (1) determine the allowed range of supernova distances and epochs, (2) study mass, nucleosynthesis, and dust formation properties of the supernovae, and (3) develop models for the propagation, evolution, and survival of charged supernova dust in a magnetized medium, in order to understand the observed duration of supernova debris fallout.  The results will have implications for supernova explosion models, for supernova remnants, and for dust production in high-redshift galaxies.   The outreach activities will include three efforts:  (1) bringing astronomy and astrophysics to college-level students in a local state prison, using research to spark discussion and interest. (2) leveraging the April 8, 2024 solar eclipse as an opportunity to bring astronomy and astrophysics to the public and to illustrate how the cosmos intervenes in our lives in ways often imperceptible but sometimes dramatic, and (3) giving frequent public talks on campus and in schools, churches, and community groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
