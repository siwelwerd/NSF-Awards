 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) research communities leverage datasets comprised of visual images or 3D virtual environments to conduct research in computer vision, robotics, multimedia systems, virtual reality, and mixed reality. Many of these datasets consist of either images previously captured with cameras and other optical sensors, or synthetic images previously rendered from 3D virtual environments. The static nature of these datasets limits their usefulness and potential applications. Recently, some researchers have provided datasets and tools for synthesizing new images from 3D virtual environments using customizable virtual camera positions, which broadens their research applications. However, many of these datasets consist of lower-fidelity indoor virtual environments that yield non-photorealistic images. Furthermore, such datasets are missing outdoor virtual environments, and tools for sharing custom camera positions within the research community are not currently available.\r\n\r\nThis planning project prepares to address the limitations of prior datasets by investigating the feasibility of using high-quality terrestrial laser scanners to capture and create high-fidelity, photorealistic virtual environments of real-world locations, both indoor and outdoor. This will be coupled with surveys of the relevant CISE research communities through workshops held at top academic conferences. This project will result in the development of two preliminary datasets, one indoor and one outdoor, using the proposed laser-scanner methodology, and the identification of community needs, priorities, and support for the proposed InfraStructure for Photorealistic Images and Environment Synthesis (I-SPIES). Undergraduate students will be engaged in the development of the preliminary datasets through the University of Central Florida\u2019s EXCEL STEM program, a former NSF STEP program\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
