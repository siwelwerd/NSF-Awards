Brands and mills are eager for a solution that does not require the industry to compromise between sustainability and performance. This project uses microbial processes to reduce the need for key harmful chemicals in the dye application process, thus minimizing the human and environmental damage caused by denim dyeing. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project addresses the problem of hazardous conditions and toxic chemical usage in the indigo dye industry. Indigo remains the sole blue dye for denim because of its beautiful blue color and unique fading properties, which has not been successfully replicated by any other dye molecule. This project aims to improve upon an engineered microbial strain that produces an indigo dye precursor molecule via fermentation; this precursor is then purified into a drop-in indigo dye ready for denim mills to use. The objectives are to 1) engineer the microbe to produce less of a toxic byproduct, 2) adapt the strain to increase its tolerance of the final product, and 3) transition from an undefined, complex media composition to a fully defined, more inexpensive medium. This will lead to a more efficient and cost-effective process at scale.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
