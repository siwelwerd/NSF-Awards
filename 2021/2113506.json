 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) is the leading professional society for women in mathematics and plays a critical role in increasing the presence and visibility of women in the mathematical sciences. This award will provide support for new and ongoing programs of the AWM that are central to its mission. The objectives of this MathCREW project are 1) to strengthen, extend, and mobilize the successful Research Network (RN) Model developed by the Association for Women in Mathematics; and 2) to make visible the outstanding work of women and minority mathematicians. This project will provide conference, workshop, and travel support for cross-disciplinary activities that will have an impact at the national scale. Establishing supportive and vibrant mathematical communities will enable successful research collaborations and advance mathematical knowledge. This award will support the 22 established AWM Research Networks and allow the formation of new ones. \r\n\r\nThe gender gap in science is very real, across all regions, all disciplines, and all development levels. Women\u2019s experiences in both educational and employment settings are consistently less positive than men\u2019s. The programs supported by the award will reach across all of the mathematical sciences, will touch all types of institutions, and will engage mathematicians at all career-levels. The project includes support for more than 726 mathematicians at many career stages, most of whom are women and many of whom are from underrepresented backgrounds. Networks will be broadened to center minority women and promote interdisciplinary research. Graduate students and research mathematicians will be brought together at AWM symposia and at workshops held during national meetings. New interdisciplinary networks and networks designed to promote the work of minority women will be formed to attack the most challenging problems of our time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
