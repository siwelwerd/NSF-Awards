 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).  \r\n\r\nNon -Technical Summary\r\nThe University of Hawaii at Manoa (UH), located on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, has a diverse student population that includes Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (NHPI, 18.9 %), and women (61.8 %). With this Partnership for Research and Education in Materials (PREM) Seed award, the University of Hawaii and the University of Washington's (UW) NSF funded Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) aim to utilize this diversity in UH\u2019s student popularion to create a pathway to recruit, retain, and ensure degree attainment by over 10 student STEM participants, mostly from underrepresented minority groups. The PREM Seed implements a multifaceted and integrated approach to recruitment of student participants, using on/off-campus diversity resources and a new PREM website. The UH-UW synergistic partnership emphasizes student mentoring (M), unique on/off campus outreach (O), energy and space materials research (R), and materials science education (E) [MORE]. This PREM Seed also enables foundational UH-UW collaborations that engage diverse student participants in research at the frontiers of the world\u2019s greatest materials research challenges. The research and education initiatives encompass: strong student dual-mentoring by both UH and UW senior participants, including individualized professional development plans; annual in-person faculty/student summer research exchanges, complimented by regular virtual exchanges; UH-UW co-development of teaching materials; joint seminars; and an annual student symposium. The partnership directly impacts research and education output at UH by increasing the number of students prepared for opportunities in materials research and assisting in elevating UH\u2019s standing in materials science education. The PREM Seed develops a sustainable pipeline to increase participation of underrepresented minority graduate students at UW. In addition, the PREM Seed outreach effort to K-12 schools drives sustainable long-term growth for underrepresented groups participation in STEM, and it enhances visibility and public appreciation of materials science. The UH-UW PREM Seed success metrics include joint publications, presentations, and retention/graduation rates of PREM Seed students. \r\n\r\nTechnical Summary \r\nThe UH-UW MRSEC PREM will develop foundational knowledge about advanced nano-to-macroscale defect-bearing and doped materials (boron compounds, chalcopyrites, layered quantum materials, and proton-irradiated solids) and the properties controlling their unique behaviors, and it investigates their use for future energy and space technologies. The PREM capitalizes on synergistic expertise and exceptional resources in materials syntheses and characterization available at UH and the UW MRSEC to create close interdisciplinary research collaborations emphasizing the education and training of a diversified next generation of scientists and engineers. The research on defect-bearing and doped materials is organized into four thrusts aligned with UW\u2019s MRSEC IRGs on Defects in Nanostructures and Layered Quantum Materials: 1) Dopant control in boron compounds for tailored gas sorption; 2) Defect modeling, characterization, and engineering in ordered vacancy compound chalcopyrites for photovoltaic applications; 3) Role of hydrogen in the chemistry of proton-irradiated solids; 4) Strain control of electronic and magnetic properties of solid materials. This research will lead to new materials and understanding of new phenomena critical for solving emerging needs in energy storage and durable space technologies. The PREM research and education activities are designed to maximize preparation of student participants for solving emerging materials challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
