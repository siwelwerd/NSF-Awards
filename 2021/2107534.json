 "awd_abstract_narration": "This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) will enable a diverse group of the US students to pursue research opportunities that relate to decarbonization of energy sector and enable carbon-free economy. Solar, wind and other renewable energy technologies enabled transformation and decarbonization of the power generation sector around the world. However, these power sources are intermittent and reliable management of renewable resources on the power grid will require a combination of flexible demand and energy storage. Electrochemical technologies offer solutions to decarbonize electricity grid and to transform transportation and manufacturing industries. Bringing in international entities that are leaders in these areas can help establish global competency in renewable energy research and provide undergraduate and graduate students international experiences, especially in a cohort environment. Specific focus is set on workforce development with relation to clean-energy jobs, as this profession is expected to grow substantially, as US commits to decarbonize its electric grid and transportation sectors. The program achievements will solely focus on students learning, as a key objective is to retain and train US workforce and to bring more underrepresented minorities in STEM to the US workforce. Student cohort immersion into interdisciplinary research activities, with hand-on laboratory experience and project-based learning will ensure development of wide range of knowledge, proficiencies and skills.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the program is to develop US diverse workforce in renewable technologies and increase students' awareness of the low temperature technologies with zero carbon emissions and to involve students in specific research activities focused on fundamentals. Over a three-year period, eighteen students from the US will spend ten weeks (each year) at the Technical University of Berlin (TU Berlin) and Fritz-Haber Institute (FHI) of Max-Planck Society conducting mentored research in a multidisciplinary environment. Student research projects will fall into three general areas: i) hydrogen technologies, ii) carbon dioxide reduction technologies, iii) low temperature ammonia production. These projects will leverage resources and state-of-the-art equipment and facilities at TU Berlin and FHI. Conducting these research activities in Germany will provide a broad, global context for the clean energy technologies, as Germany has set ambitious goals for renewable energy penetration and TUB and FHI are world leaders in electrochemical technologies. The program intends to develop globally engaged students, who think about chemical transformations, engineering, and economics within the context of zero-emission technologies and environmental impact.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
