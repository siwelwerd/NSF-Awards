 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Montclair State University is acquiring a benchtop high-resolution accurate-mass ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) system with an orbitrap analyzer to support Dr. Jinshan Gao and colleagues Meiyin Wu, Nina Goodey, Yang Deng and David Rotella. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex samples.  An instrument with a liquid chromatograph provides additional structural identification power by separating mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. The tandem capabilities, which couples together two mass analyzers, increase the ability of the mass spectrometer to analyze chemical samples. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at this Hispanic Serving Institution and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students with this modern analytical technique. It is also used by collaborators at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Fairleigh Dickinson University and Rutgers University.\r\n\r\nThe award of the UPLC-MS/MS (Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/two dimensional mass spectrometry) system is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It is especially useful for quantifying and characterizing glycan, proteins and glycoproteins as well as identifying polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, cyanotoxin, lipids and biopolymers.  The instrumentation is also used for characterizing potential drug candidates and their metabolites and for the identification of and quantification of emerging contaminants and their transformation products in water and wastewater. The instrument also serves researchers characterizing genotoxic impurities in drug substances and other products.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
