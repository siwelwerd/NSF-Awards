 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased frequency and severity of drought is amplifying the importance of understanding where forests source water. Where soil water is unavailable, woody plants commonly access water stored in the underlying fractures and pores of weathered bedrock (rock moisture). However, in contrast to the soil mantle, little is known about water stored in bedrock and how accessible it may be to plants. Better tools for fingerprinting how different species access rock moisture are needed to understand how shifts in precipitation could impact local water resources. This experiment tracks water flow through soil, bedrock, and trees via isotopic tracers to document how forest water use influences of groundwater recharge and stream flow, especially during drought. New tools for tracing water will be evaluated and communicated to students and early career scientists, so that these tools can be widely applied to better understand the fate of water resources under changing climate.\r\n\r\nThe research  is conducted at an intensively characterized and monitored hillslope in a Northern Californian old-growth forest. Experimental results will provide direct, isotopic evidence for when and where trees source water during the dry season and how their water uptake impacts groundwater recharge and streamflow. The study overcomes previous challenges with tracing rock moisture by leveraging the unique capability to trace water through unsaturated, fractured bedrock using specialized sampling infrastructure. Labeled water will be injected into the bedrock at the start of the dry season. That labeled water will be tracked through the subsurface-plant-atmosphere continuum in the dry and wet seasons that follow. The project will also estimate water age and transit time of water pools by measuring concentrations of short-lived naturally occurring radio-isotopes. Estimated transit times from labeled water and radio-isotopes will be used independently to evaluate the fate of rock moisture and its ecohydrologic significance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

By combining field experiments, isotope analyses, and hydrological modeling, the research revealed how plants access and use water from weathered bedrock (rock moisture), while also refining methodologies for studying plant water sources. These findings have broad implications for understanding plant resilience to drought, ecosystem sustainability, and water resource management. One of the key aspects of the study involved using water stable isotopes (&delta;D and &delta;18O) to identify plant water sources. It was discovered that water extracted from xylem samples cored from trees using cryogenic methods has systematically different isotopic signatures compared to water extracted via centrifugation, and that this difference is variable across species. Centrifuge-extracted water during the dry season more closely matched the isotopic composition of rock moisture for two species with contrasting water use patterns at the site, indicating that these species compete for water. This difference suggests that water sources identified via cryogenic methods may need re-evaluation, particularly for the tree species studied here. The findings also highlight the need to account for species-specific xylem structures when interpreting water source data. The study showed that isotopic variability within a single plant at one point in time can exceed temporal variability. By quantifying the variability within two species with different xylem structure, the study provides estimates of uncertainty for future studies. The research also advanced our understanding of the transport properties of the forest root zone in weathered bedrock. The weathered bedrock layer plays a crucial role in conveying precipitation to groundwater and streams, making it essential for sustaining both human-available water resources and aquatic ecosystems. This project overcame the challenge of sampling water from weathered bedrock by employing a vadose zone monitoring system (VMS) to track a deuterium tracer over multiple seasons. This tracer injection experiment simulated a 100 mm storm at the conclusion of the wet season using labeled water injected into the weathered rock in a grid of 100 ports over a 60 m2 area. The experiment and ongoing hydrologic monitoring revealed&nbsp;&nbsp;that trees are major drivers of water extraction from deep bedrock, significantly drying the subsurface during the dry season and influencing recharge patterns during the wet season. The tracer signal persisted in the subsurface for multiple wet and dry seasons, indicating significant mixing between freshly arriving water and water stored over longer timescales. This observation explains how plants can simultaneously access water of different ages and contradicts the assumption that water that is not accessible to plants is physically isolated from water that is accessed by plants. Leveraging our subsurface observations in the deep root zone, a novel mass-balance method was developed to resolve depth-distributed evapotranspiration and drainage fluxes using observed moisture changes across the root zone. Deep-rooted trees were shown to rely heavily on weathered bedrock for water, particularly during dry seasons, with annual evapotranspiration (ET) dominated by water sourced from this deep zone. In fact, 64% of ET was derived from weathered bedrock, a pattern that was consistent across multiple years. This modeling method, constrained by isotopic data from the deep root-zone, revealed that during the wet season, plant water use is concentrated in shallow soils, which undergo repeated cycles of wetting and drying. In contrast, during the dry season, deep weathered bedrock becomes the primary source of water for vegetation. When the wet season arrives, the prior dry-season water use regulates the timing and magnitude of groundwater recharge, which has direct implications for summer streamflow. The findings of this study have practical implications for managing forests and water resources in the context of increasing droughts. They demonstrate the importance of rainfall timing and intensity&mdash;not just total annual rainfall&mdash;for sustaining subsurface water storage, groundwater recharge, and streamflow.
