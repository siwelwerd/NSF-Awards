 "awd_abstract_narration": "For nearly three decades quantum computation has been the only known model of feasible computation capable of obtaining exponential speedups over any efficient classical computer [11,29,30]. Despite this great promise, the theoretical quantum speedups developed in the early 1990\u2019s are very difficult to implement as they require large-scale, nearly perfect quantum experiments. While this goal may still be quite far off, the push to develop quantum computers has already yielded incredible experimental progress in high-precision control over individual quantum systems across many different quantum architectures (see e.g.,[7,10,12,34,35]). Due to these experimental developments, we have now arrived in the so-called Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (\u201cNISQ\u201d) era, in which quantum systems of 50-70 qubits are currently being built in experimental laboratories around the world. For the first time, these experiments are approaching the complexity boundary after which it is unclear how to simulate them classically in a reasonable amount of time. This indicates that these systems may have the potential to achieve quantum speedups. However, these experiments have important limitations, such as uncorrected noise, which restrict their capabilities. The first major step for the NISQ era is to implement an experimental demonstration of a computational speedup relative to any classical computer, a goal known as \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d [27]. This goal is a watershed moment in the history of computation and a necessary milestone on the path toward developing fully scalable quantum computers. Moreover the goal appears to be rapidly approaching, and we have already seen the first claimed demonstrations of quantum supremacy [7, 36]. These experiments have attracted much attention but there are still many aspects of the claims that not well understood. While there is some rigorous evidence that such near-term quantum experiments are able to attain exponential speedups over classical computation (see, e.g., [3,4,14]) these theoretical results do not take into account many practical facets of these experiments such as uncorrected noise. Indeed, these gaps between theory and experiment have resulted in partial rebuttals of these initial quantum supremacy claims (see e.g., [8, 22, 25, 26]). Consequently, there is a great need to rigorously understand the capabilities of these near-term quantum experiments. To do this, we propose holding a workshop focusing on the prospects for achieving large computational speedups on near-term quantum experiments. Our goal will be not only be to better understand the present generation of quantum experiments, but also to understand the capabilities of tomorrow\u2019s quantum experiments, with a view toward the ultimate goal of implementing a quantum speedup for solving a practically useful problem. Intellectual Merit:The proposed workshop will lead to a complete understanding of the computational power of near-term quantum experiments. The focus will be on three objectives which will together help understand the power of existing quantum computers, as well as pave the road toward understanding the power of future quantum devices capable of attaining dramatic speedups for useful computational problems. In addition to being critical for the current near-term quantum era, these aims will foster interdisciplinary collaborations and lead to exciting new insights at the intersection of computer science, engineering, and experimental physics. Broader Impacts:This workshop will contribute to sustaining and enhancing the recent worldwide explosion of interest in quantum computation. The program will feature invited speakers and participants from academia, government and industry to disseminate the most recent ideas on quantum computation to a wide variety of scientific communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Both Vazirani and Aaronson described the need for new examples of problems which are implementable by near-term experiments, have rigorous proofs of classical hardness and yet have solutions that can be verified efficiently by classical algorithms.  Currently, every known proposal for quantum advantage has at most two of these properties.  This message echoed throughout the rest of the workshop, which focused on three interrelated topics concerning current quantum advantage experiment.\n\nThe first topic is to understand a variety of near-term quantum experiments and to give rigorous justifications that these experiments are capable of solving problems that cannot be solved in a comparable amount of computation time on a classical computer.  Talks at the workshop featured a number of different experimental proposals, including the BosonSampling proposal for quantum advantage with linear optical experiments, and the Random Circuit Sampling proposal for quantum advantage using a superconducting qubit architecture.\n\nThe second topic of the NSF workshop concerned methodology for using a classical computer to verify quantum advantage demonstrations.  This verification task is extremely important since near-term quantum experiments are very noisy, due to the phenomenon of decoherence, or unwanted interactions with the external environment.  Several talks at the workshop focused on the \"linear cross-entropy\" method for benchmarking near-term quantum experiments and on classical algorithms for spoofing this method.\n\nThe third topic of the NSF workshop concerned channeling the power of quantum advantage experiments to solve useful problems, rather than only serving as \"proof of principle\" demonstrations that quantum computers can outpace classical supercomputers.

Workshop participants proposed several critical directions for future research including:\n\nCan we find efficient classical methods for the verification of random quantum circuit sampling or BosonSampling experiments?\nCan we use the benchmarking tests developed to verify quantum advantage experiments to verify important properties of other near-term quantum experiments, such as analog quantum simulation experiments?\nCan the power of near-term quantum advantage demonstrations be channeled to solve useful problems, either pertaining to cryptography (e.g., certified random number generation) or to computational problems in physics and chemistry (e.g., to spectroscopy or quantum simulation problems?)\nCurrent quantum advantage experiments will not readily scale to larger system sizes due both to uncorrected noise and to lack of efficient verification protocols.  What is the minimal amount of quantum resources (circuit depth etc.) needed to implement a fully scalable demonstration of quantum advantage?\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/06/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William Fefferman"
