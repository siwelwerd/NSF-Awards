 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish a new REU site in astronomy and physics at Georgia State University (GSU) with a theme of exploring the various size scales in nature and their commonalities and differences in terms of fundamental physics, scientific approach, connection to other fields of study, data acquisition and measurement, statistical analysis, computational modeling, characterization of systematic and random uncertainties, presentation of results via talks and posters, and scientific writing. Each student will be given a distinct research project and work closely with their faculty advisor and group to produce presentations for a department summer symposium and a national conference. Groups of 2 \u2013 4 students will travel with a faculty member to a GSU-affiliated observatory or laboratory (Apache Point Observatory, CHARA, or Brookhaven) for a week to carry out a mini-project related to their research field. Weekly seminars led by the graduate coordinator will focus on professional practices and ethics, reading scientific papers, scientific talks, science writing, and practice for the summer symposium. Weekly lunch meetings will feature brief faculty talks and discussion questions led by graduate students to foster student discussions of their research projects and their connectivity throughout the Universe. Social activities will take advantage of the many cultural and recreational opportunities in Atlanta. \r\n\r\nGSU is a large urban research university in the Southeast and an official minority-serving institution for both Blacks and Hispanics. The Department of Physics and Astronomy is looking to build on its success in growing the number of underrepresented B.S. in Physics graduates, its informal program of paid undergraduate researchers over 20 years, and its more formal program in the past 2 years. The recruitment objective is to expand the program nationally to attract a diverse group of students with limited STEM opportunities to provide them with a research experience that is essential for their scientific development, eligibility for graduate school, and employment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
