 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide worldwide and is often transported from application areas to surface water when solubilized in runoff, sorbed to eroded sediment or taken up by plants. There is evidence that suggests both glyphosate and its main metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) may pose a risk to human health, as well as cause adverse effects in the environment. Concerns about impacts to the environment and human health continues to grow and application rates increase with production of glyphosate-resistant crops for more efficient weed control in agriculture. The widespread use of glyphosate may be resulting in glyphosate transport to drinking water resources, especially in karst topography. Scientific understanding and analytical methods for analyzing glyphosate and AMPA with low detection and consistent monitoring data is a lacking.  The goal of this proposed work is to develop analytical methods for analyzing glyphosate and AMPA by establishing a partnership with Dr. Lee Blaney, a leader in environmental engineering at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC). The new analytical methods will support a long-term collaboration focused on detecting and quantifying polar pesticides occurrence and creating sustainability assessment tools for agroecosystems. Implications of this work will inform decision-making and assist farmers in sustainable agroecosystem management.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposed work is to develop analytical methods for analyzing glyphosate and AMPA. The new analytical methods will support a long-term collaboration focused on detecting and quantifying polar pesticides occurrence and creating sustainability assessment tools for agroecosystems. This research addresses a significant gap in knowledge and need for sensitive analytical methods for detecting glyphosate and AMPA at low concentrations and environmental monitoring. In collaboration with Dr. Lee Blaney at University of Maryland Baltimore County, new pretreatment protocols using solid phase extraction and quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe extraction with liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy will be developed. Stored frozen water, sediment and plant samples collected previously from watersheds on karst topography will be transported to UMBC and analyzed using the proposed methods. New data for glyphosate and AMPA at low detection limit will be generated; current methods do not provide enough resolution for detecting polar pesticides at low concentrations. Analytical results will be used to evaluate the occurrence of glyphosate and AMPA, transport, fate, ecotoxicity, and human toxicity. This proposed research not only develops transformative techniques for detecting glyphosate and AMPA at low concentrations but provide real-world methods for safeguarding sensitive species and human health. Research activities will be disseminated through traditional academic journals and via on-boarding training modules for researchers analyzing glyphosate and AMPA. Underrepresented students in engineering will be engaged in the formation of the training to encourage and support research development, diversity and inclusion.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Various global regulatory agencies have different maximum residue limits for glyphosate-based chemicals. To safeguard human health, appropriate techniques are needed to detect glyphosate and quantify potential environmental impacts. This project integrated the development of novel methods for analyzing glyphosate-based products and geographical models to understand how analytical methods can be optimized and how experimental data can be extrapolated for estimating potential outcomes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project generated new knowledge on methods for detecting glyphosate at low concentrations, its presence in central Kentucky and Belize and potential impacts. Experimental runtimes for analyzing glyphosate were reduced and the responses were enhanced to ensure low levels of detection were achieved. Using the optimized pretreatment protocol developed by the research group, the glyphosate-based concentrations were quantified.&nbsp;The experimental findings were used to develop techniques for locating and measuring glyphosate in karst watersheds in Belize and central Kentucky. We assessed the potential environmental and human toxicity implications related to the usage and reductions of glyphosate in agroecosystems by creating a geographical analytic model. The model was based on the amount of the possible emissions and potential&#8239;toxic effects on human and ecosystem health. The impact of glyphosate on groundwater connectivity was defined by exposure, fate, occurrence, damage, and avoidance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Using analytical, geospatial, and geostatistical models, we demonstrated that: 1. experimentally resource intensive analytical methods can be simplified by using pre-column derivatization and offline solid-phase extraction before liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and 2. Analytical data can be used to predict concentrations of glyphosate-based products in watersheds. Pre-concentration approaches for detection at sub-g/l increased sensitivity by an easy, quick matrix cleansing and hydrophilic-lipophilic extraction. High recovery was made possible by optimized liquid chromatography settings, sorbent elution, and mass spectrometry parameters that were employed to enhance the response factors.&nbsp;Analytical overlay was used to look at possible glyphosate and&nbsp;glufosinate&nbsp;predominance zones throughout the Kentucky River basin and Belize River basin. Results for the Kentucky river basin indicate that glyphosate and&nbsp;glufosinate&nbsp;may be compromising groundwater in 47% of the area. Glyphosate pollution may be present in about 35% of the groundwater in the Belize region. Agricultural regions with considerable karst were more likely to have severe glyphosate runoff, highlighting the vulnerability of these surface water bodies. In the lower south and extreme karst regions of the watershed, herbicide concentrations in groundwater recharge were high.&nbsp;Our research work significantly developed a short chromatographic separation for the target analytes through the various investigation efforts.
