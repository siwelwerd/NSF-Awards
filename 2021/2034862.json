Attending conferences such as ICC is beneficial for the professional development of graduate and undergraduate students in the area of communications research.\r\n\r\nThis award provides support for students in the United States to attend this conference. Since the conference will be virtual, support to help pay for registration fees will be provided. It will help the students be exposed to recent development in the field, and network with professionals. This will in turn help build the next generation workforce in communications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
