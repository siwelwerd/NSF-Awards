 "awd_abstract_narration": "Center for Advancement toward Sustainable Urban Systems \r\n\r\nThe Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program supports the enhancement of research capabilities of minority-serving institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research.  CREST promotes the development of new knowledge, enhancements of the research productivity of individual faculty, and an expanded presence of students historically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines.  With National Science Foundation support, California State University Los Angeles (Cal State LA) establishes the Center for Advancement toward Sustainable Urban Systems (CATSUS).  Its goals are to: (1) advance novel and transformative research focused on issues related to the generation, supply, consumption, protection and revitalization of energy and water systems within the framework of urban environments, (2) increase the research capacity of Cal State LA, and (3) develop highly-effective undergraduate and graduate level research education curriculum, training and opportunities in STEM fields for underrepresented minority groups at Cal State LA.  Research interests in sustainable urban systems stem from the fact that energy consumption in urban areas is responsible for 70% of greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition, although urban areas cover only 3-4% of the planet\u2019s surface area, they affect 41% of watersheds globally.  CATSUS will integrate research findings into undergraduate and Master\u2019s level engineering education, K-12 and community college outreach, and policy-informing components, while creating pathways towards doctorate and postdoctoral research programs.  \r\n\r\nThree research thrusts aim to advance knowledge in the areas of physics, chemistry, engineering, materials science, experimental techniques, and modeling methodologies.  Research outcomes from the thrust areas will be transformative, addressing both fundamental and applied questions relating to sustainability of urban energy and water resources.  The thrust area of Energy Systems and Management in Buildings will (1) develop new thermal management strategies in buildings and photovoltaic devices, and (2) advance knowledge regarding urban bio-derived fuels and grid-scale energy storage systems.  The second thrust area, Advanced Materials for Energy and Water Applications, will develop/design new materials for (1) highly efficient photovoltaics, and (2) water treatment including wastewater remediation and seawater desalination.  The third thrust area, Resilience of Urban Water Bodies, will develop (1) novel and effective water resource and sediment management strategies, and (2) novel experimental approaches to ascertain the long-term impacts of wildfires and microplastics on urban watershed water storage and quality.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
