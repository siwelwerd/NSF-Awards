 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nTomorrow\u2019s society will need to address issues of conserving and protecting natural resources like soil and water, deal with the rising threat of climate change and associated issues, and mitigate hazards like flooding, landslides, and coastal storms. No single disciplinary approach can combat these issues alone. For this there needs to be engagement with people from diverse cultural backgrounds, and incorporation of indigenous perspectives and different ways of teaching, learning, and knowing in the K-16 curriculum so future generations can address these challenges equitably and sustainably. This project will bring together a community of K-12 teachers, educators, geoscientists, undergraduate students from minoritized backgrounds, and cultural knowledge keepers and resource managers from Hawaii and Bad River and Red Cliff tribal communities in Wisconsin. With these partners, the PIs plan to develop geosciences curriculum and lesson plans for K-16 classrooms tied to places with scientific and cultural significance, and are relevant to learners\u2019 interests, cultural backgrounds, lived experiences, and the needs of the local communities. Students participating in this project will take ownership of their own education, and will acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to address tomorrow\u2019s societal issues, and to fill workforce needs in Tribal, State, and Federal resource management and conservation, sustainability, environmental consulting, science communication, and science education, among other fields. \r\n\r\nThis project will create a cross-cultural geoscience learning ecosystem providing experiential learning activities at sites with both cultural and scientific significance in Hawaii and on Tribal lands in Wisconsin. The investigators in collaboration with Tribal elders and knowledge keepers, will lead professional development activities for pre- and in-service educators to support them in developing curriculum aligned with NGSS Earth Sciences and Science and Engineering Practices built upon local knowledge and Earth science concepts and addressing real-world issues. This project will identify effective practices for as well as barriers to developing and implementing place-based, socially and culturally relevant STEM curriculum. Specifically the project will: 1) recruit, empower, and retain students from diverse backgrounds, especially Native American/Native Hawaiian students, in the environmental and geosciences; 2) foster a sense of place and \u201cconnection to Earth\u201d for students living in places far from those where their cultures are rooted, and for \u201clow-context\u201d students, whose cultures may not be deeply associated with place; 3) support teachers to develop reusable and sustainable relevant, place-based curriculum aligned with Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS); and 4) develop sense of place remotely using virtual learning environments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
