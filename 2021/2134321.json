 "awd_abstract_narration": "The demographic distribution of scientists, especially those in positions of authority, does not reflect that of the US population. Some of the causes of this disparity are known, such as a lack of role models and the tendency for people to look within their own circles when they recruit, appoint, and promote. This award will provide resources, trainings, opportunities, and structures that will allow participating plant science and affiliated organizations to change that construct by Rooting Out Oppression Together (ROOT) and SHaring Our Outcomes Transparently (SHOOT). The network is unusual in its breadth and scope, and it extends upon previous collaborative activities in the plant sciences by incorporating partners that serve underrepresented populations, as well as other non-profits and companies. The participating organizations have each independently begun this work, and through this award they will coordinate to exert meaningful and lasting change to reshape the plant science community into one that is truly equitable, inclusive, and anti-racist. The network partners will design and implement interventions to remove barriers that prevent the participation and success of individuals historically excluded from leadership and influence roles in science, assess the success of these interventions, and share the outcomes. Broadly sharing the lessons and outcomes from this deep and careful self-study will inform other organizations and professional societies as they strive towards becoming more inclusive and diverse scientific communities. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the Rooting Out Oppression Together (ROOT) and SHaring Our Outcomes Transparently (SHOOT) research coordination network (RCN) is to develop a collaborative network that facilitates cultural changes throughout the plant sciences to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion. The network will coordinate the development and dissemination of resources for building and sustaining equitable and inclusive scientific organizations, including assessment tools and equity action plans. It will provide broad training of the plant science communities in equitable practices and operations, while implementing dual-membership programs and shared participation in conferences. Hundreds of scholars and practitioners will be trained in topics such as inclusive teamwork, climate and culture assessment, and culturally responsive mentoring, even as the participating organizations themselves implement well-informed changes to their governance and leadership structures. The network will create shared web pages, guides, workshops, webinars, and action plans to educate and inform our community members and others across STEM. The RCN initially consists of seven plant science professional societies and organizations; it has also established formal partnerships with organizations committed to supporting underrepresented and marginalized scientists, as well as industry partners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
