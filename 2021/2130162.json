 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cellular organization is critically dependent on the self-assembly of various membraneless organelles inside the cell. However, the principles and molecular mechanisms that drive and regulate the assembly of these organelles and define their functions are poorly understood.  This project integrates cutting-edge genetics and molecular quantitative approaches to provide major insights into the mechanisms responsible for the assembly and function of evolutionarily conserved membraneless organelles assembled in germ cells of model organism Drosophila (germ granules). These cells give rise to egg and sperm cells, and therefore, are responsible for continuity of life. This research will be integrated into several cell and genetics undergraduate courses and will directly engage undergraduate and graduate students in quantitative cell and molecular biology training.\r\n\r\nGerm granules show the properties of soft condensed matter and they often change their morphology during developmental transitions. Recent research identified an evolutionarily conserved germ granule multisubunit complex assembled on the large scaffold Tudor protein. Tudor scaffold has 11 protein-protein interaction modules (Tudor domains) and Tudor complex components are required for germ cell specification. The goal of this project is to provide molecular understanding of how this multisubunit Tudor scaffold complex is assembled using purified components and quantitative biochemical approaches. In addition, using super-resolution microscopy, it will be determined how different components of the complex are assembled into large germ granules in vivo. Furthermore, to understand the function of Tudor complex, enzymatic activities of its components upon the complex assembly will be characterized and the significance of the complex for germ granule formation, morphology and germ cell specification will be determined by mutational approaches.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
