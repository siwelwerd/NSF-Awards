 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Animal-microbe symbioses are ubiquitous in nature and are found in biological processes that include host immunity, development, nutrition, and fertility. Many mutualisms are thought to have developed from parasitic relationships but it is rare to find a symbiosis at the transition point between these states. The Fellow will investigate a symbiosis wherein previously parasitic bacteria of fruit flies have now developed a dual parasitic-mutualistic relationship with the host. While maintaining the ability to kill male hosts (male-killing), the strain is also required for host development. This system represents a unique opportunity to study a mutualism at a symbiotic transition point, allowing the Fellow to investigate the genetic basis for the change and in what contexts this condition may develop. The work includes outreach to local students from diverse backgrounds through a database of online, low-cost activities that teach important scientific concepts.\r\n\r\nThe Fellow will address this research topic by performing experiments with a strain of Drosophila bifasciata infected with male-killing Wolbachia to address two main points: the genetic basis of this symbiotic transition and the contexts in which dual male-killer-mutualists successfully invade a population. The hypothesis is that the infected host strain has developed a critical developmental defect that is rescued by the parasite. To address the first question, the Fellow will perform comparative genomics on the infected host strain and an uninfected strain using fluorescence microscopy, gene expression analysis, and trans-infection experiments to identify the hypothesized host defect(s) at genetic and cellular levels. To address the second question, the Fellow will use theoretical population genetic modeling, experimental cage experiments, and population genetics of wild-caught D. bifasciata flies to determine the conditions in which a dual mutualist-male-killer may succeed in a mixed population. This work will be completed with training from Drs. Robert Unckless and Erik Lundquist at the University of Kansas and will focus on population genetics, bioinformatics, theoretical modeling, and microscopy. The research is complemented by development of a local program where diverse scientists will engage local kids in games and activities that teach scientific concepts and that will be available to anyone online.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Symbioses can range from parasitism, where one organism benefits at the expense of another, to mutualism, where both organisms benefit from each other. Importantly, these relationships can change over long periods of time, with parasitic relationships evolving into mutualisms, for example. However, we know very little about how these transitions in symbiotic relationships occur because it is rare to find a symbiosis at a transition point in real time. Knowing more about how and why host-microbe symbioses change over time will allow us to predict future changes in symbioses and understand how past symbioses evolved. This project, &ldquo;From parasitism to mutualism in a <em>Wolbachia-Drosophila</em> symbiosis&rdquo;, validates and investigates a new case of an evolving mutualism between the bacterial symbiont, <em>Wolbachia</em>, and its fly host, <em>Drosophila bifasciata</em>. This strain of <em>Wolbachia</em> is a &ldquo;male-killer&rdquo;, which results in death in embryonic males, but females survive. Further, empirical evidence shows that female flies in a <em>Wolbachia</em>-positive<em> </em>lineage exhibit normal reproduction and life-history traits when the symbiont is present. However, if the bacteria are removed, the ovaries of females develop abnormally and fewer offspring are produced. Genomic evidence demonstrates that the host has mitochondria that are likely dysfunctional without the symbiont, which is likely the basis of these phenotypes. Thus, we have discovered a symbiosis that exhibits traits of both a parasitism (male killing) and mutualism (rescue of host reproductive defects likely caused by dysfunctional mitochondria). This not only identifies new and rare genetic changes underlying a symbiotic transition, it is also a novel mechanism of symbiotic evolution which suggests that host mitochondrial defects can underlie an evolving mutualism. It also establishes a study system to empirically study symbiotic evolution further. The results of this work have been reported at three international conferences and multiple upcoming articles. Further, it funded a new project at the University of Kansas where a group of postdoctoral researchers worked to develop activities to teach kids important principles in biology and to host these activities in partnership with the KU Natural History Museum. For each event, the researchers hosted these free activities for the public, where local children could learn about biology from biologists. Each event was focused on a particular topic, like DNA or aquatic life, and featured 4-6 activities for kids to participate in such as strawberry DNA extractions or making an aquatic food web. Seven events have been hosted thus far and were well-received by the public with dozens of attendees for each event. Based on this success, the project will continue under the sponsorship of the KU Center for Genomics, allowing this outreach project to continue past this award.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/30/2023<br>\nModified by: Jessamyn&nbsp;Perlmutter</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
