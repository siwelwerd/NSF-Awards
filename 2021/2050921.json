The program offered engaging meetings such as Graduate Student Panel, Research Seminars, GRFP Application and Graduate School Workshop, and Chalk Talks by REUs.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Seminars on research techniques, literature searching, scientific writing/presentation, ethics, abstract writing, deep learning and chemical education and several library sessions were offered in addition to the professional development workshops on Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation and Inclusive Mentoring. 4 RET high school science teachers participated in the last 4 weeks of the program each year. Curriculum Development workshops were offered for teachers. Each RET worked with an REU student, their faculty advisor and teacher facilitator to create a lesson plan inspired from research projects. Students and teachers presented their research findings with their posters at the Research Symposium in the end of the program. All students wrote conference abstracts and several REUs gave oral presentations at the national conferences. Women made up 61% of the participants, while 41% were minority participants, including African American and Asian American individuals in our REU/RET program. 5 technical papers were published in peer-reviewed journals with the REU students and 3 students transferred from Community Colleges to research universities after attending our REU program. The REU/RET Site at Stevens was evaluated by an external evaluator and received highly positive feedback. The program successfully inspired all participants, providing valuable research experiences that helped them shape their career goals in science and engineering. The RET program will have a long-term impact on teachers as they plan to use their lesson plans in their courses and enhance the curricula in nanotechnology, science and engineering classes in their high schools.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 02/05/2025<br>\nModified by: Pinar&nbsp;Akcora</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050921/2050921_10719377_1738814290513_2023_REU_RET_Symposium_Flier--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050921/2050921_10719377_1738814290513_2023_REU_RET_Symposium_Flier--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Symposium flier_2023\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050921/2050921_10719377_1738814290513_2023_REU_RET_Symposium_Flier--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Symposium flier_2023\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Research Symposium flier contains Graphical Abstracts prepared by each REU student.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Pinar Akcora</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pinar&nbsp;Akcora\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Symposium flier_2023</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050921/2050921_10719377_1738814102715_Symposium_flier_2022--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050921/2050921_10719377_1738814102715_Symposium_flier_2022--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Symposium flier_2022\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050921/2050921_10719377_1738814102715_Symposium_flier_2022--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Symposium flier_2022\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Symposium flier consists of Graphical Abstracts prepared by each REU student.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Pinar Akcora</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pinar&nbsp;Akcora\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Symposium flier_2022</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050921/2050921_10719377_1738813965022_REU_RET_Symposium_flier_2021--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050921/2050921_10719377_1738813965022_REU_RET_Symposium_flier_2021--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Symposium flier_2021\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2050921/2050921_10719377_1738813965022_REU_RET_Symposium_flier_2021--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Symposium flier_2021\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Symposium flier consists of Graphical Abstracts prepared by each REU student.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Pinar Akcora</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pinar&nbsp;Akcora\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Symposium flier_2021</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
