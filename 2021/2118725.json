 "awd_abstract_narration": "One important way to help struggling students improve in math is to deliver personalized support that addresses their specific weaknesses. Many math questions have common wrong answers (CWAs) that correspond to specific errors students make during their answering process, caused by misconceptions or a general lack of knowledge on certain math skills. To date, CWA identification and support remains a labor-intensive process at a limited scale because it requires significant effort by teachers and/or domain experts. In this project, the investigators will develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based mechanisms that can automatically identify CWAs from students\u2019 answers to short-answer math questions and diagnose errors. Once these errors are identified, the investigators will enlist the help of teachers to design feedback and support mechanisms in various formats such as textual feedback messages and short videos. In turn, the investigators will integrate these diagnosis and effective support mechanisms into a teacher interface to support them in either classrooms or online learning environments. Overall, this project has the potential to lead to i) better understanding of CWAs in math questions and the underlying errors and ii) effective CWA support mechanisms for each error type. The project will be grounded in ASSISTments, a free web-based learning platform, therefore directly benefiting the 500,000 US students and 20,000 teachers using it and potentially an even larger number of students and teachers through the dissemination of research findings.\r\n \r\nThis project consists of four main research activities. First, the investigators will leverage math expression embedding methods to learn the representations of student errors by clustering CWAs across multiple questions in the latent math expression embedding vector space. These learned representations will enable the automated diagnosis of student errors in real time. Second, the investigators will develop new knowledge tracing algorithms that go beyond typical correctness analysis and analyze the full answer each student submits to each question. These algorithms will enable the automated tracking of students\u2019 progress in correcting their errors. Third, the investigators will crowdsource multiple types of student support from teachers and integrate both student error diagnostics and support mechanisms into the existing ASSISTments teacher interface. This interface will provide feedback to teachers on which students are struggling in real time and recommend a support, which the teacher can either adopt and customize or reject and create their own support instead. Fourth, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of each support mechanism in helping students correct their errors. This experiment will identify which support mechanisms are most effective at helping students correct each error type and improving learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Our main goal is to develop algorithmic, data analysis, and interface tools to help teachers in monitoring student affect. Due to the impact of COVID-19 and the switch to online learning, observers had limited access to real classrooms and opportunities to observe student affect in-person, causing a pivot to the use of self-report data and historical data. Our accomplishments were three-fold: On the affect detection algorithm side, we developed active learning algorithms to reduce the number of affect labels we need to collect to train affect detectors, relieving some burden off of teachers and/or classroom observers and/or self-report. We also developed differentiable learning algorithms for online (machine) learning settings that help us learn efficiently from sequential, time-series data, such as student affect.&nbsp; The resulting algorithms achieve as much as 50% sample efficiency improvement in a wide range of applications, even for non-educational applications such as item recommendation in collaborative filtering. On the data analysis side, we investigated the generalizability of affect detectors across different student demographic groups and whether we can use them to warm-start the initial stage of the active learning process. Our results suggest that doing so can result in a good quality detector of engaged concentration in some conditions, such as pre-training on data from urban schools, and not so effective in others, such as pre-training on data from suburban schools. We also found that the amount of data used for pre-training makes a difference. Furthermore, we found that it was possible to forecast student affect as much as two minutes in advance, creating the possibility of new interventions that disrupt negative affect before it occurs. On the interface side, we developed a tool called LIVE-CHART, a real-time reporting interface designed to help teachers monitor student performance, behavior, and affect in the classroom. LIVE-CHART allows teachers to monitor students asynchronously and students to self-report their affect. The tool was used by 9 teachers in their classrooms, collecting self-reports of affect from about 312 different students between 2021 and 2023. This award (partially) enabled the professional development of over 10 graduate students at UMass, UPenn, and WPI, resulting in tools that are integrated into ASSISTments workflow in predicting affect. There are new teacher reports that have benefited from our more clear understanding of affect.</span></p>\n<div><span><br /></span></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/02/2024<br>\nModified by: Neil&nbsp;T&nbsp;Heffernan</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
