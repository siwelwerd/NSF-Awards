 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe current demand for enhanced material properties has often followed a bottom-up approach to synthesize new polymers using complex chemical procedures that generally just expands that vast array of long-lasting plastics in the environment.  A more sustainable approach is to use existing materials in new ways.  For example, the high cost of poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) and its inherent stability strongly favor end-of-use recycling and/or upcycling as opposed to landfilling. In this project, the widely valued approach of compatibilizing polymers in blends to address the critical economic and environmental sustainability needs of our society will be accomplished by performing simple chemical modifications on existing feedstocks of PEEK.  Specifically, a new physical approach will be used to create blocky copolymers that are known to be beneficial in polymer blends by selectively modifying specific sequences of units along the chains of commercially available polymers.  The blocky PEEK polymers will be targeted toward new blends of PEEK with other valuable polymers as a means to eliminate waste and upcycle PEEK to new materials with synergistic enhancements in properties. These same polymers will also be used to facilitate strong bonds between PEEK and solid fillers in the formation of new composites with enhanced mechanical properties. With respect to the grand challenges facing our society, this project will provide cost-effective, environmentally friendly, readily available materials alternatives needed to meet critical demands for advanced materials in a wide range of commercially relevant technologies.  The nature of research activities in this project, involving close collaboration between academic and industrial laboratories, will provide broadly interdisciplinary training to a diverse community of researchers and students, including underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe widespread commercial application of block copolymers as blend compatibilizers and fiber sizings is limited by the expensive and rigorous polymerization methods needed to control the sequence of comonomers in the form of discrete blocks.  As a transformative approach, the PIs propose a facile, physical polymer chemistry alternative to yield controlled blocky microstructures in poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) via post-polymerization functionalizations in a heterogeneous, semi-crystalline, gel state. The fundamental focus of this project will be on pushing the limits of blockiness that is achievable with this new process, expanding the synthetic toolbox of functionalization chemistries for targeted interfacial interactions/reactions, and understanding the molecular-level impact of blocky functionalization on phase behavior and interfacial interactions in high-performance polymer blends and composites. This academic-industrial collaboration is poised to address the grand challenge of forming interfacially active copolymers for PEEK-based blends and composites, with compatibilization efficiencies rivaling that observed with conventional segmented block copolymers.  The overall fundamental goal of this project is to understand the role of the compatibilizer microstructure (blocky vs. random) on interfacial properties in multiphase systems. The interdisciplinary nature of research activities in this project, ranging from pure chemistry, materials recyclability, to macromolecular engineering, will provide a plethora of educational opportunities to a diverse community of citizens and researchers eager to contribute to our nation\u2019s leadership in ensuring a healthier, more sustainable global society.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project has been focused on critical aspects of polymer sustainability aimed at finding new applications of polymer waste streams. Blending of two or more different polymers together for a totally new application is one sustainable way to reuse waste plastics. Unfortunately, however, different polymers dont mix very well. Instead, they prefer to separate from each other (like oil and water) causing very poor properties of the mixture. To date, the best way to improve mixtures of polymers A and B is to add an AB block copolymer compatibilizer to the mixture that effectively ties the two polymers together. However, block copolymer synthesis is difficult and expensive. In this project we have developed a new way to make block copolymer compatibilizers using a simple gel-state reaction process that modifies the chemical structure of pre-existing commodity polymers. We have explored the usefulness of these new blocky compatibilizers in both polymer blends and carbon fiber composites. To expand the classes of polymers that can benefit from this novel approach, we have explored a wide variety of chemical functionalities that can be used to make the blocky copolymers. Using advanced characterization tools focused on probing the precise arrangement of the functional groups along the polymer chains, these studies have led to significant transformations in our understanding of copolymer sequencing and reactivity of polymers in a heterogeneous gel-state.\r\n\n\nCentral to this project is the semi-crystalline gel of the polymer we use to create the blocky compatibilizers. We have found that these gels are remarkably structured over a very wide range of length scales (from nanometers to microns). These gel structures can also be controlled by choice of gelling solvent, dissolution temperature, and gelation temperature. Basically, we have found that the desired fibrillar gel structure requires careful control over the formation of crystal nuclei (the tiny arrangement of closely packed chains that start the development of larger crystals). This fundamental understanding has greatly expanded the intellectual impact of this project in new directions of 3D printing of aerogels and the creation of new controlled drug delivery materials. A broader impact of this project is directly focused on the Critical Aspects of Sustainability program as we have discovered that waste PET water bottles may be simply converted to lightweight PET aerogels that are mechanically robust and have very low thermal conductivity. From a life cycle perspective, it is important to note that these PET aerogels are composed of pure PET (without any chemical modification) and after use, may be further processed back to water bottles if desired. Projected applications to benefit our society will encompass lightweight thermal insulation materials for clothing to new insulation for aerospace applications.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RobertBMoore\n"
