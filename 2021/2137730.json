 "awd_abstract_narration": "People rely on coastal resources for food, water, and energy. However, extraction of these natural resources over the last century has led to pollution and coastal land loss. Protecting and restoring coastal environments, while continuing to support local economies, has never been more urgent. This project\u2019s vision is to establish recycling programs in coastal communities that will divert glass from landfills and turn it into glass sand products to restore coasts and preserve historic sites. In this networked blue economy approach, new products are also created to generate revenue for operating the glass recycling facilities. In partnership with the New Orleans-based glass recycling startup company Glass Half Full, this project brings together local university researchers from the fields of chemical engineering, civil and environmental engineering, river and coastal engineering, and ecology and evolutionary biology to identify new markets for recycled glass products, determine where recycled glass sand should be used to prevent coastal land loss, ensure that recycled glass sand is safe to use in coastal environments, and engage local communities in preserving important cultural sites that are currently threatened by land loss. This project will also create service, research, and training opportunities for local students of all ages to learn about the complex, ever-changing connections between technology, economics, history, and the coastal environment.\r\n\r\nA networked blue economy based on glass recycling will be established in the greater New Orleans area through a convergent research approach that brings together multiple science and engineering disciplines capable of engaging a broad range of stakeholder interests, from potential industry partners (chemical engineering) to conservationist groups (ecology) to residents whose homes are threatened by coastal land loss (professors of practice with training in community engagement) to the wide network of government and non-profit groups currently working in this area (river and coastal science and engineering). The research plan accelerates the translation of laboratory materials innovation into practice with consideration of all perspectives engineering, ecological, societal, and economic to accomplish the following deliverables: (i) develop value-added products and identify potential markets for these products, including (a) stimuli-responsive natural clay particle-based additives to recycled glass sand that release surfactants to sequester oil/chemical contaminants only when needed and (b) recycled glass sand treated with natural polymeric additives to improve material properties (e.g., erosion resistance); (ii) obtain approval from relevant State and Federal agencies for use of recycled glass sand as an Erosion Control Product on the Louisiana coast; (iii) disseminate results of vegetation ecological testing and suspended sediment exposure experiments with marine animals to demonstrate safety to conservation groups and residents; (iv) identify demonstration project sites by combining coastal modeling and community engagement; (v) broaden participation through (a) outreach to coastal Native American communities to identify historic sites threatened by coastal land loss; (b) engagement of undergraduate students in service-learning and research projects through elective and core courses in the Tulane Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Departments; (c) participation of graduate and undergraduate students in cross-disciplinary research project meetings; and (d) development of a K-12 outreach workshop on soil stabilization to be delivered to students in partnering communities as well as Tulane\u2019s biannual outreach programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Using recycled glass sand produced by the New Orleans start-up company Glass Half Full, the ReCoast research team conducted materials characterization experiments and ecological safety testing in response to inquiries by individuals from non-government community organizations involved in coastal restoration and preservation, local government agencies, and the Pointe-au-Chien Indian tribe. We also created a website where we post updates to our group's activities: https://recycleforthecoast.org/.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our research showed that recycled glass sand is mostly silica, like natural sand in the US Gulf Coast region. Using recycled glass sand for restoration will not introduce harmful chemicals into the environment.&nbsp; Specifically, levels of potentially hazardous elements used in glass processing were detected in parts-per-million levels that were either comparable to or less than levels found in native soil (for example, barium and copper) or well below regulatory levels set by the Environmental Protection Agency (for example, lead &lt; 100 ppm for growing root vegetables, &lt;400 ppm for children's playgrounds).&nbsp; Furthermore, no leaching of these elements from the glass sand was detected during toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) analysis, a standard procedure used to evaluate soil-to-groundwater transport of contaminants in the environment. Paper labels are mostly sifted out during Glass Half Full's processing and are retained with the \"gravel\" size; invisible residues and glues were rarely detected in sand intended for restoration projects and made up &lt; 2% (by weight) of the sample when detected. While recycled glass sand is not sharp to the touch, individual grains are more sub-rounded than well-rounded compared to natural sand because it has not been weathered in the environment.&nbsp; Ongoing research is looking into ways to round the sand through processing and determining how quickly it would become well-rounded naturally in the environment. Marsh grasses and willow trees grew well in the recycled glass sand when a source of nutrients was provided (for example, from the water), as the recycled glass sand itself is not a source of nutrients. Aquarium experiments showed no adverse impact of recycled glass sand on fish (Atlantic croaker, gulf killifish), blue crabs, eastern oysters, or white barnacles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beyond the research findings, broader impacts of the project included highly interdisciplinary student training, both for students involved in the research directly as well as for students who participated in projects through two chemical engineering service-learning courses.&nbsp; Additionally, we implemented two environmental restoration projects.&nbsp; The first project was with the Pointe-au-Chien Indigenous Tribe (PACIT), a frontline community that took a direct hit from Hurricane Ida in August 2021.&nbsp; After assisting them in recovery from the hurricane (along with many volunteers from other groups), we used recycled glass sand to stabilize an eroding slope near their community center in April 2022.&nbsp; The second project was implemented in collaboration with the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana (CRCL).&nbsp; We used biodegradable burlap sacks (donated from local coffee companies) filled with recycled glass sand to build a \"wall\" to repair a blow-out from Hurricane Ida (a blow-out is where a narrow section of land is eroded, in this case allowing the brackish water of Lake Pontchartrain to infiltrate the fresh water marsh behind it). Finally, we developed a ~45 minute workshop that illustrated the process of erosion and challenged them to construct protections for their \"houses\" using various strategies. This workshop is being delivered four times per year through Tulane University's Girls in STEM at Tulane and Boys at Tulane in STEM programs, which primarily serve 5<sup>th</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup> grade students from underrepresented groups in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).

After assisting them in recovery from the hurricane (along with many volunteers from other groups), we used recycled glass sand to stabilize an eroding slope near their community center in April 2022.  The second project was implemented in collaboration with the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana (CRCL).  We used biodegradable burlap sacks (donated from local coffee companies) filled with recycled glass sand to build a \"wall\" to repair a blow-out from Hurricane Ida (a blow-out is where a narrow section of land is eroded, in this case allowing the brackish water of Lake Pontchartrain to infiltrate the fresh water marsh behind it).
