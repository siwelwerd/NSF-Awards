The award provides registration support to facilitate participation of US-based researchers, including graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early stage investigators, in the 4th International Conference on Plant Synthetic Biology, Bioengineering, and Biotechnology Conference held virtually October 30-November 1, 2020.  The meeting brings together researchers from various academic, industrial, and government sectors in an interactive and engaging meeting and enables students and early career researchers to learn from an interdisciplinary community of leading scientists and engineers through organized talks and virtual discussions\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nPresented by the Society of Biological Engineering (SBE), the conference includes scientists and engineers from universities, industry and government, and consists of multiple sessions in areas such as:  Redesigning Photosynthesis, Genome Scale Engineering, Organelles and Synthetic Compartments, Engineering Bioproduction, Biotic Interactions and Synthetic Communities, Sustainability, and Engineering Form.  Through the interactive online platform the conference will provide a venue for scientific presentations from a diverse group of often field-separated biologists and engineers as well as international researchers working in various areas pertinent to plant synthetic biology.  The conference will encourage student and trainee engagement in the field, as well as participation of women and underrepresented scientists in the field of plant sciences, synthetic biology, and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
