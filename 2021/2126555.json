 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is to improve outcomes for ablation, a procedure to address tumors. Currently, surgical removal is the preferred treatment for most focal tumors, but it is an invasive, expensive procedure.  Thermal ablation, an alternative treatment, represents a $2 B market growing at 10% annually, even with the current limitations. It is a minimally invasive, outpatient procedure that can be performed safely at a fraction of the cost; however, incomplete ablation can result in local recurrence. The proposed project improves ablation technology for low-cost treatment and improved clinical outcomes. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project advances a human serum albumin-based formulation that can be injected to a target site to serve as a thermal accelerant. This project conducts diffusion studies, important for certain site like the highly perfused environment of the liver. This project will measure electrical conductivity and specific heat values over a wide range of temperatures (20-90 oC) to explain the enhanced temperature profile observed during the microwave ablation with the technology. These results are essential to understanding the thermal behavior of both the technology, the thermal effect on the surrounding tissue, and the overall ablation volume and shape. These data will inform a computational model for predicting the microwave ablation patterns in a clinical setting.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This translates into a significant amount of power absorption by HeatSYNC gel during ablation and its subsequent transfer to the surrounding area as if an extra antenna is present. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of the gel increases proportionately with increasing temperature, meaning that HeatSYNC gel absorbs microwave energy synergistically during ablation for effective heating (Aim 1.1, Figure 1); 2) A computational model was successfully developed for ablation with HeatSYNC gel using <em>ex vivo</em> ablation experiments. The model accurately predicts how HeatSYNC gel effectively absorbs microwave energy and transfers heat to its <em>ex vivo </em>surroundings. To further develop the current computational model pertinent for use in humans, <em>in vivo</em> studies are needed to incorporate the perfusion levels of different tissues (Aim 1.2); 3) HeatSYNC gel remains at the original injection site within the time frame of ablation in the various tissues (Aim 2).</p>\n<p>The Phase I study results strongly indicate that <strong>HeatSYNC gel is an exceptional thermal accelerant.</strong> It possesses all the necessary characteristics that enable it to augment microwave energy, and due to its high viscosity, remain within the original injection site. Further, by augmenting microwave energy, HeatSYNC gel increases energy delivery to the target site and provides a larger ablation volume (Figure 2), a key advantage for complete ablation of lesions.
