 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanotechnology is increasingly finding uses in agriculture, medicine, energy, consumer products including electronics, environmental technologies, transportation products, and packaging. Nanotechnology deals with materials which are smaller than one-billionth of a meter at least in one dimension, and these materials are not necessarily benign in nature. There has been an effort by researchers and manufacturers to make nanomaterials sustainable with no or minimal impacts on the environment and its components. The 10th SNO Conference  November 3rd to 5th of 2021 will highlight sustainability in nanotechnology research. The sessions in this year's conference will address multiple relevant and emerging topics and provide a platform for free exchange of ideas to develop collaborative research and strategize future research directions. The tenth conference will host early career investigators in a session entitled \"Rising Stars in Sustainable Nanotechnology.\" Moreover, the conference will offer a workshop on Infectious Diseases and Nanotechnology with a series of experts in the topic. A poster session will also be held virtually, where it is expected a broad participation of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral scholars and early career investigators. \r\n\r\nNanotechnology is increasingly finding uses in agriculture, medicine, energy, consumer products including electronics, environmental technologies, transportation products, and packaging.
