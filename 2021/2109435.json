 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2021, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This research project examines Ophiocordyceps, a fungus which is a parasite known to secrete compounds that affect the nervous system of carpenter ants. Ophiocordyceps species can change the behavior of these ants, leading them to produce characteristics including tremors, hyperactivity, and diminished social behaviors. Which fungal compounds are involved and how they modify the behavior of these ants is unknown. This research will test the targets and functions of Ophiocordyceps proteins. Doing so will increase our understanding of parasite evolution to manipulate animal hosts, and could potentially discover new pharmaceutical compounds. Further this work will generally teach us more about the insect nervous system and behavior, which may have significant agricultural implications. The fellowship will also introduce young students to science through a community science project using the iNaturalist app to encourage exploration of wilderness areas in Florida to search for ants.\r\n\r\nTo understand the mechanism of host manipulation, this project integrates four molecular genetics techniques with behavioral assays to characterize the function of previously identified, putative secreted manipulation proteins. First, the fellow will identify the host targets for secreted candidate proteins using a Yeast-Two-Hybrid method. Next, the contribution of each gene in behavioral manipulation will be tested via CRISPR Cas9 technology to induce knockouts in Ophiocordyceps followed by infection and behavioral assays. The fellow will also test potential behavioral effects of the proteins through production in yeast and isolation for use in behavioral assays. Finally, the transferability of these biomolecules to affect general nervous system processes will be tested in C. elegans through the heterologous expression of candidate genes in E. coli strains used for feeding. To increase participation of underrepresented groups in science, this project will utilize accessibility programs from the University of Central Florida, a nationally accredited Hispanic-Serving Institution, to involve undergraduate researchers. To promote this project, the fellow will connect with K-12 classrooms through schools and museums, and through initiatives such as stemCONNECT Florida and Skype-A-Scientist. And to train the fellow for a future in academia, the fellow will participate in pedagogical academies and teaching programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To do so, we used three major research objectives: 1)&nbsp;<strong>IDENTIFY the host targets of behavior-affecting proteins</strong>, 2)&nbsp;<strong>CHARACTERIZE their role in manipulation of ant behaviors</strong>, and 3)&nbsp;<strong>CONNECT the fundamental behavior-manipulation mechanisms across animal models</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through our efforts we were able to accomplish most of our goals; however, working with non-model organisms can be difficult. This proved true during our first research objective, as attempts to set up a Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H) assay between&nbsp;<em>Ophiocordyceps camponoti-floridani</em>&nbsp;and its host&nbsp;<em>Camponotus floridanus&nbsp;</em>(the Florida carpenter ant), were unsuccessful. Unable to proceed, we developed a bioinformatic approach to predict protein-protein interactions using machine learning tools instead, which we published in the journal&nbsp;<em>Scientific Reports</em>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-40764-8\">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-40764-8</a>). We were also able to test a handful of these&nbsp;<em>Ophiocordyceps&nbsp;</em>biomolecules using a previously established Y2H platform in the round worm&nbsp;<em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>, a model organism commonly used to study neurological effects. Future projects will continue to build upon this framework to further classify the targets of behavior-affecting proteins. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>In our second research objective, we planned to produce extracts of candidate behavior-affecting biomolecules in yeast or bacteria and test the effects of these extracts on healthy ants. While we were unable to reliably produce these proteins using yeast, we were able to produce high concentrations using Rosetta 2 bacteria. Production of protein extracts in this manner allowed us to establish a behavioral assays pipeline. Our first assay focused on the behavioral effects of an aflatrem-like molecule and was published in the journal&nbsp;<em>Animal Behaviour</em>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2023.06.011\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2023.06.011</a>). In this project we showed that aflatrem causes the same zombie-esque staggered walking behavior that is commonly observed in&nbsp;<em>Ophiocordyceps-</em>infected ants. Unfortunately, the time spent trouble shooting issues with Y2H and production of&nbsp;<em>Ophiocordyceps</em>&nbsp;proteins in yeast unfortunately meant that we did not have enough time to complete our third research objective; however, production of&nbsp;<em>Ophiocordyceps&nbsp;</em>proteins in Rosetta 2 bacterial cells, a common food source of&nbsp;<em>C. elegans</em>, means that the groundwork for behavioral assays in&nbsp;<em>C. elegans</em>&nbsp;is already in place. Future work has been funded to continue with this project.</p>\n<p>In addition to our laboratory research, we also performed a great deal of community outreach and included many new junior research scientists from underrepresented groups in our work. We recruited and compensated 4 undergraduate students from an equal distribution of gender identities, 3 of whom were from underrepresented groups, and 2 of whom were first-generation students. Furthermore, the laboratory work from 2 of these students was vital in the publication of our&nbsp;<em>Animal Behaviour</em>&nbsp;paper and all 4 students presented their work at the annual Showcase for Undergraduate Research Excellence at the University of Florida.</p>\n<p>We also built a website in both English and Spanish for our community science project, the Zombie Fungus Foray (<a href=\"https://wcbeckerson.wixsite.com/thezombiefungusforay\">https://wcbeckerson.wixsite.com/thezombiefungusforay</a>). This community science page was instrumental in establishing our outreach program, resulting in reoccurring outreach events with 5 local middle/high schools in Florida and a partnership with Seminole County parks involving 2 of their summer camps and guided wilderness tours for observing local zombie ants. We also partnered with the Orlando Science Center to host a hands-on microscopy exhibition for zombie ants during their annual children&rsquo;s Halloween party and to beta test our educational zombie ant VR game, created in collaboration with Charissa de Bekker as part of the NSF CAREER grant (Award 1941546) and now available for download on Steam (<a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2416150/Zombie_Ants_VR/\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2416150/Zombie_Ants_VR/</a>) during their Otronicon event. Our community science project also disseminated our research to a larger audience online by partnering with stemCONNECT and Skype-a-scientist, particularly during the first year of the fellowship when COVID restrictions limited in-person interactions.</p>\n<p>A major portion of this community science work was facilitated by a project page on the iNaturalist platform (<a href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/the-zombie-fungus-foray?tab=species\">https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/the-zombie-fungus-foray?tab=species</a>). As part of this project, I participated as an iNaturalist curator for&nbsp;<em>Ophiocordyceps</em>&nbsp;and classified more than 1,800&nbsp;<em>Ophiocordyceps</em>observations from the public. This platform also acted as a quantitative metric for gauging the progress of our community science program. Local GPS data for&nbsp;<em>O. camponoti-floridani&nbsp;</em>observations indicates a substantial increase in public interest, most notably following the months of October when our outreach efforts peaked each around Halloween. This data also shows that&nbsp;<em>O. camponoti-floridani&nbsp;</em>is now the species of&nbsp;<em>Ophiocordyceps</em>&nbsp;with the most identifications on the platform, having gone from less than 20 during 2016-2021 to over 220 observations by the end of 2023! We attribute our success in outreach to our ability to relate our research to topics the community find intriguing, and our ability to deliver the information in a fun and engaging way using multi-media platforms.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/29/2023<br>\nModified by: William&nbsp;C&nbsp;Beckerson</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2109435/2109435_10839009_1700408434805_Figure_3___ZFF_Annual_Seasonality_of_O.c_f_Observations--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2109435/2109435_10839009_1700408434805_Figure_3___ZFF_Annual_Seasonality_of_O.c_f_Observations--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3 - ZFF Annual Seasonality of O.c-f Observations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2109435/2109435_10839009_1700408434805_Figure_3___ZFF_Annual_Seasonality_of_O.c_f_Observations--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3 - ZFF Annual Seasonality of O.c-f Observations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A graph showing the seasonality of Ophiocordyceps camponoti-floridani observations from iNaturalist during the course of this fellowship.
