 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human alteration of the environment has led to rapid declines in animal populations, particularly in freshwater habitats. When animals are lost, the important roles they play in ecosystems are also lost. Understanding the consequences of these biodiversity declines for the natural services they provide requires long-term data. Freshwater mussels are a good example. Few people know that they were once abundant and are now rare. They feed by filtering algae and other material from the water. This \u201cbiofiltration\u201d helps with nutrient cycling and provides ecosystem services such as improved water quality for humans. This project will synthesize 30 years of data on mussel distribution, abundance, and community composition across rivers in the Ouachita Highlands of Oklahoma and Arkansas. Information on species biological traits, such as temperature tolerance, body size, and filtration rates, will be used to estimate how mussels help the environment and benefit humans. This will be combined with climate change projections to predict how these functions may change in the future. Products from this project will include journal articles, a book on mussel ecology, and an educational web site and poster on the mussels of Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nLong-term data are needed to understand how Anthropocene declines in animal biodiversity and abundance affects the ecosystem functions they perform, which are a product of interactions among species\u2019 functional traits, the environment, and community composition. This project will synthesize 30 years of data on mussel traits (thermal tolerance, adult body size, life history strategy), mussel community structure (species richness, abundance, and biomass from 8 rivers in one biogeographic region, the Ouachita Highlands), mussel community change, environmental gradients (temperature and flow), and ecosystem function (biofiltration and nutrient cycling and storage) to: (1) Estimate mussel contributions to ecosystem function across spatial scales (mussel bed, river, biogeographic region); (2) Determine how mussel losses and environmental change have altered these contributions, and how this is related to species functional traits; and (3) Use species traits and projections for future stream flows and temperatures derived from downscaled climate models to forecast how these contributions will change in the future. All data will be made publicly available in a web-based, permanent archive.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

When animals are lost, the important roles they play in ecosystems are also lost. Understanding the consequences of these biodiversity declines for core ecosystem functions requires long-term data. Freshwater mussels are globally imperiled bivalve mollusks that feed by filtering algae and other material from the water. This biofiltration influences multiple ecological functions such as nutrient cycling and primary production and provides ecosystem services such as improved water quality for humans. This project synthesized 32 years of data on freshwater mussel distribution, abundance, biomass, and community composition across 8 rivers in a single biogeographic region, the Ouachita Highlands of Oklahoma and Arkansas. Information on species functional traits was combined with distribution and biomass data to estimate spatial and temporal patterns in biofiltration, nutrient cycling, and nutrient storage within and among rivers. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Across this biogeographic region there was high variation in mussel biomass within and among rivers, which generally increased with increasing watershed area. Rates of mussel-generated ecosystem functions (biofiltration, nitrogen and phosphorus excretion, and nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon storage) were linearly related to mussel biomass, thus spatial patterns of these functions generally mirrored biomass patterns. Biofiltration capacity, estimated as the number of times mussels could filter the overlying water, was linearly related to community biomass but constrained by discharge, with mussels only filtering a signfiicant proportion of the water column at low flows. Data from sites that were sampled over multiple time points showed that mussels are declining across this biogeographic region and the relative abundance of species is changing, with drought-tolerant species increasing in proportion to drought-sensitive species. These changes have led to decreases in mussel-provided biofiltration, nutrient cycling, and nutrient storage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Products from this project include synthesis articles in the scientific literature and a book on the ecology of freshwater mussels for academics and resources managers.
