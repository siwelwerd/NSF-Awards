 "awd_abstract_narration": "Searching for new materials and engineering systems with desired quantum properties holds promise to enable leaps not only in fundamental solid-state physics but also in quantum information processing and quantum sensing. This project acquires a versatile shared-use system for studying the physical properties of new quantum-mechanical devices and materials at low temperatures and high magnetic fields. The modular and extensible nature of the system allows for a wide range of effects to be examined. At the same time, the turnkey nature of the system makes it well suited as a platform for training the next generation of scientific researchers, both in the context of classwork in experimental materials science and condensed-matter physics and for undergraduate and high-school students performing summer research programs in the laboratories of the scientists involved in the project. \r\n\r\nThe project acquires a multi-use cryostat, with temperatures ranging from 1.8 to 400 K in its standard configuration and to 50 mK with an included dilution-refrigeration insert. Combined with a 14 T magnet, this enables measuring materials over a broad range of parameter space. The base capabilities of the system are leveraged by several measurement modules including magnetization, specific heat, and susceptibility to perform multimodal measurements of new quantum materials. Research projects include an extensive program on van der Waals heterostructures, where engineering strain into monolayer graphene has been shown to provide a wide range of control over the electronic correlation and magnetic states, and the construction of Moire superlattices built from multilayer graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides lead to exotic quantum phases. Magnetic susceptibility measurements in the sub-Kelvin regime characterize rare-earth antiferromagnets for use in high-efficiency quantum transduction devices. Another platform for quantum transduction, field-tuned superconducting resonators, are characterized via microwave impedance measurements. Rapid-cycle testing of magnetization and resistivity support characterizing a wide variety of correlated electronic and magnetic materials prior to ultra-fast optical measurements. Temperature-dependent Hall Effect measurements on patterned 2D plasmonic materials yield insight into the mobilities and damping pathways of the resonances. Combined electrical and magnetic measurements probe the electrochemistry of candidate materials for future battery cathode designs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
