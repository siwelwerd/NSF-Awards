 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a novel type of therapeutic using cutting-edge technology and adult stem cells. This therapeutic may be used in hospitals to treat patients with severe COVID-19 infection;  the proposed drugs would be made from the cells of healthy brains and have the capability to correct an aberrant immune response in sick people. This can potentially be used for other neurodegenerative diseases as well as for other drug discovery research. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the urgent need for development of drugs to modulate the immune response to prevent escalation of COVID-19 to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The hypothalamus is crucial to secretion of cortisol and other modulators that dampen the immune response following activation. This project will test whether exosome-based therapeutics produced from hypothalamus stem cells can abate the cytokine storm that causes ARDS in COVID-19 patients. Technical tasks include: 1) engineer pluripotent cells to produce exosomes with enhanced neuronal specificity by transducing cells with the XStamp-BHP1 and XStamp-NCAM lentiviral vectors; 2) grow pluripotent cells at scale using the mTesr3D system; 3) induce cells to differentiate into hypothalamus stem cells; 4) collect exosomes. The technical milestone is to engineer exosomes with at least a 70% enhanced neuronal specificity and to produce highly concentrated hypothalamus stem cell exosome particles. These engineered human hypothalamus stem cell exosomes can be used to dampen the cytokine storm in a mouse model of LPS-induced ARDS. This proposal establishes the feasibility of using hypothalamus stem cells as therapeutic candidates for treatment of ARDS in COVID-19.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Finding more effective and less invasive modalities for studying and treating neurological disease is one of the greatest challenges confronting the medical world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all the segments of the brain the hypothalamus is the most crucial for the overall operation of the human body. The hypothalamus is the central clearing house for myriad functions of the brain and body, as it governs the body?s response to everything from hypertension to sleep disorders to mental health issues.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Florica Therapeutics is developing a drug and gene therapy delivery platform that can transport therapeutic modalities across the blood brain barrier, resulting in more efficient and effective treatments that are less invasive for the brain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We participated in the NSF I-Corps market research program in 2021. As part of the I-Corps Boot Camp program we conducted 40 interviews with stakeholders in the neurological space. We then went on to participate in the I-Corps National Program where we interviewed another 101 stakeholders in an effort to identify the markets where our technology could most likely find success.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; What we discovered during the I-Corps experience was that due to the enormous challenges of conducting clinical trials for our initial indication of sepsis/COVID, this indication is&nbsp;an inpenetrable market for a small startup, making it unfeasible as a beachhead indication. However we found that there is a huge market need for delivery of drugs across the blood brain barrier. In particular there is a great need for improved therapies in the rare neurological disease space, an under-addressed space with low barriers to entry, where treatments are sparse and very limited in efficacy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We narrowed our focus to Tay Sachs disease, a rare neurological disease that is severe in its impact, disabling and tragically shortening the lives of its young patients. The providers who care for these children are desperate to find any kind of treatment that can more successfully address the fierce challenges facing them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We are now working on developing a gene therapy delivery system that can directly address the single-gene dysfunction that leads to Tay Sachs, but our platform is applicable to any number of neurological diseases. Our I-Corps research indicates that the healthcare providers in the Tay Sachs space would consider even minimal improvements in outcome, such as a 5% increase in life expectancy, to be great and welcome progress compared to what is presently being achieved in the field.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been able to demonstrate that human hypothalamus stem cells exist and that they can be grown in the laboratory. We have identified the gene signature for those human hypothalamus stem cells and have successfully harvested their exosomes to utilize as the foundation of our drug and gene therapy delivery platform. These stem cell exosomes are similar to the hypothalamus stem cell exosomes found in mice and that have proven successful in reducing neuroinflammation. Treatment of neuroinflammation, in itself, is a vital goal in the treatment of neurological diseases, for example Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer?s Disease, and other dementias.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only did we show that these exosomes can decrease neuroinflammation but we also generated in vitro proof of concept that it is feasible to use exosomes from human hypothalamus stem cells to deliver cargo across the blood brain barrier.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; While our beachhead market is Tay Sachs we believe our technology has the potential to address numerous neurological diseases by allowing the delivery of cargo such as gene therapy, proteins, and oligonucleotides.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Using our delivery platform to transport existing treatments and newly-created treatments across the blood brain barrier, we hope to more efficiently target and access specific regions of the brain, and more effectively treat a host of ailments that presently defy the current available treatment regimens, such as Alzheimer?s, Parkinson?s, and ALS.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe our technology will be a significant game changer in the treatment of neurological diseases and that there is no limit to the potential applications. The market for improved treatments is great and there are real opportunities to make a big difference in the neurological disease space.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to our work in the lab we have participated in other actions to contribute to the advancement of science, including staffing a booth at the Potrero Hill STEM Science Day Fair in July 2022, where we helped bring interactive science activities to disadvantaged young people in order to spark their interest in pursuing STEM careers.
