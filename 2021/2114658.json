 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (PRF) is directed towards the development of a system for integrating large amounts of data using machine learning algorithms to provide new insights into the understanding of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the urban atmosphere. The results of this effort are expected to help regulatory agencies estimate emissions from non-traditional sources of VOC in the atmosphere and improve the overall accuracy of emission inventories.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this research focus on: (1) categorizing emitted (primary) and chemically formed (secondary) VOCs from comprehensive measurements; (2) investigating local (vehicles, indoor, industry, landfill, etc.) and regional (wildfire, ocean, etc.) origins of primary VOCs; (3) identifying the dynamic and spatial hotspots of specific VOC emissions; (4) understanding the implicit and nonlinear relationships between primary VOCs and their secondary VOC products; and (5) the influence of environmental factors on primary VOC degradation and secondary VOC formation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
