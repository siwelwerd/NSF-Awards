 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of functional neuroimaging data have provided compelling evidence that brains function as highly organized networks. This has prompted the need for computational and statistical tools to reliably construct networks from imaging data, and subsequently to discover patterns and differences between individuals or groups, for instance between cognitively normal subjects and others exhibiting particular pathologies.  The common approach to defining these networks is to compute temporal correlations between signals measured at distinct locations (voxels) in the brain, with stronger correlations corresponding to network connections.  Due to temporal trends and noise from physiological and other sources that can contaminate the measured signals, the seemingly simple task of quantifying functional connectivity between brain regions in fact requires careful statistical modeling and efficient computational tools in order to draw reliable inferences related to brain networks.  The primary aim of this project is to develop flexible statistical models of fMRI data that build on conventional correlation-based network construction to provide a more robust and complete picture of connectivity in the brain.  The project will develop a graphical user interface for computing and visualizing connectivity properties. And the project will provide trainees with extensive international collaborative experience. \r\n\r\nThe project consists of three parts.  In part 1, fMRI signals are modeled as a spatio-temporal process, where voxels within the same brain region share a common stochastic structure.  In contrast to conventional methods, the model does not assume stationarity of the process over time or perform a preliminary averaging of signals from voxels in the same region.  The removal of the stationarity assumption adds robustness to the method since such a property is unlikely to hold in experimental conditions.  Methods from functional data analysis allow for estimation using all voxel-wise data.  In part 2, a novel definition of functional connectivity is given that is parameter- and model-free.  For any two brain regions, the distribution of temporal correlations across all pairs of voxels within these regions constitutes their connectivity profile, and is termed the correlation density.  Methods for analyzing distributional data, including exploratory, clustering, and regression analyses, can be used to extract information from this rich representation.  Additionally, network analyses can still be performed as in conventional studies by evaluating specific quantiles of the correlation density, such as the median.  In part 3 of the project, validation of network construction through reliability and classification scores will be carried out on real data sets. These will include established data banks such as the Human Connectome Project, data gathered from small animals that have been anesthetized, and lesioned brains of individuals with consciousness disorders.\r\n\r\nA companion project is being funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIntellectual Merit: An important problem in neuroscience is to quantify the functional connectivity between different areas of the brain. Unlike structural connectivity, which corresponds to physical connections (white matter tracts) between brain regions, functional connectivity cannot be measured directly;rather, it is inferred through the synchronization of brain activity as measured by neuroimaging data gathered from EEG or fMRI scans, for example. Such indirect measurements of brain activity reflect variability at multiple spatial and temporal scales, requiring careful statistical analysis. The overwhelming majority of functional connectivity studies utilize a very simple correlation measure between regional signals to quantify the connectivity, but this measure does not account for the various sources of variability, including noise. The research goals of this project were aimed to build more robust quantifications of functional connectivity based on new statistical models and computational strategies, as well as to establish reliable methods for assessing the uncertainty in the inferred functional connectivity by accounting for different sources of variability. The common thread in methods developed in this proposal is the use of data obtained at the original (voxel-level) scale as opposed to the regional averages that are used in most studies. Through mixed effects modeling, cluster analysis, and correlation screening, the methods developed under this project during the award period constitute important additional tools for the statistical analysis of functional connectivity.\r\n\n\nBroader Impacts:The research activities of this proposal, while centered around the use of statistical principles and techniques, were directly motivated by the need to improve the reliability and reproducibility of analyses of neuroimaging data. The tools developed have the potential to impact how we learn about the brain. In addition, there are an abundance of data examples from other scientific disciplines, such as agriculture, traffic, or sensor networks, that are similar in structure to the fMRI scans that were the subject of study in this project. Modifications of the developed methods could prove useful in these areas as well.\r\n\n\nThe award supported the training of 3 PhD students and one Masters student. Chao Zhang (PhD, UCSB) worked under the grant during the first two years, and his work on the project constituted a significant portion of his PhD dissertation. Chau Tran (Masters, UCSB) and Robin Liu (PhD, UCSB) also contributed significantly to the projects. At the partnering institution in France, Han Lbath completed her PhD under the support of the ANR, with her work on the project comprising the entirety of her PhD thesis.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/21/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AlexanderMPetersen\n"
