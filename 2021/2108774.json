 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Monika Raj of Emory University is studying how chemical modification of specific amino acids in proteins influences their role in various biological processes and diseases.  Modifications to lysine units in proteins are known to turn on or turn off very important functions inside cells, which are responsible for cell growth and communication between cells.  A deep understanding of lysine modifications and their influence on interactions between proteins is crucial to the development of new molecules that disrupt those protein-protein interactions and may someday serve as therapeutics of various diseases.  However, identifying influential lysine modifications is a particularly daunting challenge that has yet to be fully met by traditional biochemical strategies.  Dr. Raj aims to develop new approaches that enable selective chemical labeling of modified lysine units and the linking of protein partners.  These innovative chemical approaches are anticipated to provide a general strategy to systematically identify lysine modifications and protein-protein interactions caused by lysine modifications.  Furthering impact of the project are efforts that engage underrepresented individuals across a range of ages, educational levels, and socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds, and encourage their active interest and retention in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).  Those efforts focus on bringing together a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students to gain interdisciplinary research training in organic chemistry and biochemistry.  Outreach activities with high school students (especially women and individuals from underrepresented groups) will expose them to basic concepts of biochemistry through fun experimentation and aim to equip them with the social support needed to facilitate the pursuit of a STEM major in college.  \r\n  \r\nChemical strategies successfully target a particular functional group at a single amino acid site in the presence of reactive amino acid side chains on protein surfaces are limited.  Even more rare are organic reactions that can proceed under conditions mild enough to label biomolecules without deleterious effects.  To address these challenges, this research project will develop chemical probes based on oxidative coupling with nucleophiles and nucleophilic substitutions that enable site-specific incorporation of photoreactive and affinity groups near modified lysines.  This method will be employed for the site-selective labeling of modified lysine with various cargoes and for capturing protein-protein interactions mediated by modified lysine units.  Abnormal lysine modification of a protein can trigger its unique interaction with other proteins, thus leading to a variety of different diseases; however, the chemical methods for selective detection of lysine modification and associated protein-protein interactions are still lacking.  This research will provide highly selective chemical probes that can effectively detect modified lysine and capture their protein partners.  Thus, the proposed research has a great potential to further our understanding of how these lysine modifications and their aberrations regulate various cellular signaling processes and lead to various diseases.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

These changes are essential for proteins to work correctly and interact with other parts of the cell. Understanding PTMs is important for figuring out how proteins function normally and what might go wrong in diseases, which is key to developing new treatments. One specific type of PTM involves adding two small tags, known as methyl groups, to a part of the protein called lysine. These di-methyl PTMs can switch proteins on or off or change how they behave, directing proteins to different areas within the cell. They also help proteins attach to or detach from other proteins, similar to how magnets can attract or repel each other. Because they play such important roles, di-methyl PTMs on lysine are vital for the proper functioning of our cells. To better understand the roles of these di-methyl tags and find early indicators of diseases, scientists need to develop methods to identify them. However, this is difficult because these tiny tags are naturally rare and hard to detect. Di-methyl lysine is almost the same size and charge as natural lysine, making it hard to distinguish. Additionally, proteins have many reactive sites, so selectively tagging this small di-methyl lysine tag is a significant challenge. By creating new ways to identify these di-methyl tags, researchers can learn more about their roles in health and disease. This knowledge could lead to the development of new treatments and diagnostic tools. The primary scientific aim of this project had two main goals. The first was to develop new chemical tools for identifying and characterizing dimethyl lysine sites on proteins, regardless of the peptide sequence. This would help us understand their essential roles in various biological processes. The second goal was to create chemical probes to capture protein-protein interactions (PPIs) facilitated by dimethyl lysine. In addition to the scientific goals, the project had a significant outreach component to promote diversity in STEM fields. This included providing lab research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups and organizing Protein Tagging (PT) Day events to engage high school students from similar backgrounds. These efforts aimed to support and encourage these students to pursue STEM majors in college, fostering diversity and inclusion in STEM education and careers. During the NSF-supported project, significant progress was made. One notable achievement was developing a novel chemical method called Tertiary Amine Coupling by Oxidation. This method allows the selective modification of the dimethyl lysine PTM tag to an aldehyde handle, even in the presence of other reactive amino acids on proteins. This technique was shown to selectively and robustly label Kme2 peptides and proteins in complex cell lysate mixtures under biocompatible conditions. It was also used to identify Kme2 sites at the single molecule level through fluorosequencing, establishing a unique strategy for identifying Kme2-PTMs using mass spectrometry-based proteomics or single molecule fluorosequencing. These advancements pave the way for the sensitive and digital quantification of Kme2 sites in increasingly complex proteomic mixtures, greatly enhancing our understanding of PTMs and their roles in biological processes. The developed chemistry was also applied to form ketones with another PTM involving the addition of a dimethyl group at the protein's N-terminus. Methods were established to distinguish aldehydes from ketones by reacting them with a 1,2-diaminophenyl group. Furthermore, this chemistry was used to generate another PTM called allysine and to introduce aldehyde handles on linear and cyclic peptides, which can be used for late-stage diversification of peptides. Importantly, the project provided valuable training for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs, helping them improve their technical and research skills and fostering their professional development. New workshops were established to engage middle and high school students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, in hands-on chemical biology activities. These workshops aimed to inspire interest in STEM fields and provide the social support necessary for these students to pursue STEM majors in college. In summary, the project successfully achieved its major goals by developing innovative chemical tools for studying dimethyl lysine PTMs. These tools have broad applications in proteomics and chromatin biology and hold promise for advancing our understanding of dimethyl lysine in PTMs related to health and disease.
