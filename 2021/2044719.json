 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation \u2013 Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project is to develop a novel, environmentally friendly, profitable recycling process utilizing advanced chemistry and equipment design for the recovery of valuable and critical metals from waste printed circuit boards. Currently, the most common methods used to recycle waste electronics are through combustion in a smelting process or through low cost, off-shore labor. If successful, the project will enable a simple, efficient, and low-cost option for recyclers to develop vertically-integrated, domestic supply chains for the recovery of critical and valuable metals from electronic wastes.  This process will be a direct replacement to the combustion of E-Wastes with significant reduction in environmental impact. Success will enhance the economic viability of the domestic recycling supply chain and further contribute to environmental justice by lowering exploitation of vulnerable communities. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project aims to develop an integrated, low-cost, near closed loop system for the recovery of metals using liquid systems without the use of harsh acids or cyanide. To achieve this objective the multidisciplinary team seeks to 1) develop control methodologies for the integrated leaching of base metals with the use of a regenerated oxidizer, 2) design and validate a small zero-emission and scalable metal plating reactor for recovering copper, 3) develop electrolyte purification strategies to minimize waste streams, and 4) demonstrate gold leaching and recovery. The anticipated output will be an integrated flowsheet for the recycling of E-Wastes, economic value stream maps, and a technical/economic assessment of the viability of the technology. Successful completion of the project will enhance the circular economy and preserve scarce global resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
