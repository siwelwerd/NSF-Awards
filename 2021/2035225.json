 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ozone and particulate matter are components of air pollution that affect the environment and human health; however, gaps remain in current understanding of how these components are formed. In the present project, laboratory experiments are conducted to shed light on reactions of atmospheric precursor molecules. Results are compared to existing models and field data and will provide new mechanistic insight that can help inform air pollution control strategies. Participating graduate students are integrated in the outreach plan to engage K-12 students and teaches. \r\n\r\nSystematic laboratory studies are performed on reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxidation intermediates and products to improve current understanding of tropospheric photochemistry. The tandem chamber reactor system used for experiments is equipped with state-of-the-art analytical tools including high-resolution proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) and comparative reactivity method (CRM) for analysis of components and to quantify OH reactivity, respectively. Method development and instrument calibration are an integral part of this work. New observations are evaluated with existing box models and compared to previously obtained field datasets for re-examination. Results may reveal fundamental new mechanisms and help gain greater insight into ozone and particulate matter production under various pollution levels. PIs and diverse graduate students are supported through this project, and outreach is planned to elementary school students and teachers, while middle school students will be provided opportunities to visit campus and experience hands-on air sampling and gas analyses instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
