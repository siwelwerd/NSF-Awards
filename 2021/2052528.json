 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chronic health conditions are financially and emotionally costly. Immediate, creative action is needed to provide solutions for managing physical, social and psychological needs that maintain autonomy and quality of life. Research on long-term functioning of those with chronic illnesses is lacking. The Center to Stream Healthcare In Place (C2SHIP) unites the best minds in academic medicine with leaders in biomedical industry to research, develop and promote in-place care technologies for managing chronic diseases in the home. The University of Arizona serves as the C2SHIP Lead Site with Partner Sites being University of Southern California, Baylor College of Medicine, and California Institute of Technology. The Center will accelerate innovation through partnerships, multi-specialty collaborations, and resource sharing. C2SHIP will prepare an educated workforce to promote wellness through self-care technologies.\r\n\r\nThe Center\u2019s trans-disciplinary team will pursue research and development in new material-based sensors, reconfigurable designs, and system integration with data mining, machine learning, and Artificial Intelligence. Through \u201cInternet of Things\u201d, patient data can be streamed to medical professionals at remote locations in real-time, establishing a mobile hub for vulnerable patients in their own home. C2SHIP will focus on mitigating physiological, environmental, and psychological changes for real-time management and intervention. The University of Arizona site will focus on the design and develop of new sensors and systems that can perform effective and accurate data analysis using machine learning and Artificial Intelligence technologies. \r\n\r\nThe Center will accelerate knowledge and intellectual property transfer between academia and industry through collaborative partnerships. This will promote rapid development of new technologies , and  transform health care delivery by enhancing the quality of life of chronically-ill patients while reducing health care costs and preventing hospitalizations. Student engagement in the proposed research projects will create opportunities with Center companies and organizations, and provide multidisciplinary participation at C2SHIP conferences and workshops. The University of Arizona site will recruit students from diverse backgrounds by engaging them in the proposed research. The University of Arizona site will work with The Center to engage underrepresented undergraduates through cross site workforce development plans and activities.\r\n\r\nData produced from this project will be deposited in servers at the C2SHIP Center using password protected Box data sharing folder and will keep for duration of five years. Box is a cloud computing business which provides file-sharing, collaborating, and other tools for working with files that are uploaded to its servers. The PIs and Co-PIs at the C2SHIP Center will have password-protected accounts and servers to conduct their research. The proposed study will only collect non-sensitive data. No personal identifiers will be recorded or retained by the researchers in any form. The University of Arizona projects that collect patient data will be approved by The University of Arizona IRB prior to project onset. All data will be deidentified, with no personal identifiers recorded or retained in any form.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
