 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). \r\n\r\nThis doctoral dissertation project examines the processes that result in concrete being a leading construction material in rapidly developing cities despite environmental impacts that may reduce resilience to extreme weather events. The research examines the financial investments that drive the growth of concrete residential buildings. The research also highlights the environmental impacts of urban infrastructure development, such as increased in flood risks, by studying the extraction of sand from riverbeds for subsequent use in concrete construction. The project provides data that can inform attempts to reduce the impacts of sand and stone extraction on weather-related disasters, including floods and landslides. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in the methods of scientific data collection and analysis, the project contributes to localized efforts to advance sustainable construction methods. The findings from this research have the potential to contribute to policy conversations that seek to improve working conditions for construction workers, thereby providing security and acceptable working conditions to laborers.\r\n\r\nThe researchers examine development of concrete construction in urban areas, particularly those that are impacted by extreme weather. In these settings, the widespread use of concrete is implemented amid concerns that it increases the risk of impacts from natural disasters. Drawing on theory from economic geography and urban political ecology, the researchers examine the financing of residential construction, the tradeoffs faced by laborers in the construction industry, and the processes by which the extraction of sand contributes to concrete production and related environmental impacts. The research includes a complementary set of ethnographic methods, such as participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and focus groups with diverse stakeholders in the construction industry. These stakeholders include real estate developers, architects, urban designers, building and labor contractors, government bureaucrats, and sand traders. Findings from this study will address the imbalance between rapid urban economic growth in developing contexts and the social and environmental impacts of concrete, the primary raw material for construction in many settings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

It draws on ethnographic fieldwork in India to interrogate how remittance-driven urban construction is creating new patterns of uneven development and environmental change in Indian cities. The starting point for my research is Kochi, the largest city in Kerala, and one that has been experiencing a rapid acceleration in the construction of &ldquo;world-class&rdquo; infrastructures over the last few decades. Beginning from a single infrastructure construction site, I deployed a &ldquo;follow the thing&rdquo; methodology, to trace the translocal networks of money, materials, and labor that are producing new roads, flyovers, malls, and condominiums in Kochi. This methodological process took me to real estate expos and convention centers in Kochi, sand extraction sites in the ecologically sensitive Western Ghat mountains of south India, and migrant worker camps in Kochi&rsquo;s peripheries. There is rich literature examining circuits of capital and knowledge that connect the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;global cities&rdquo;, by highlighting ways in which they inter-reference and compete with one another to attract foreign funding for elite urban development projects. By contrast, my work starts from the mundane built environment to develop a more complex and nuanced set of social, economic, and ecological interdependencies that link Kochi&rsquo;s rapid growth to wider geographies in uneven and contradictory ways. My work draws attention to neglected migration histories, marginalized transnational actors, and forgotten plantation legacies that have long connected Indian cities to other parts of the Indian Ocean world much before the advent of neoliberal urbanization. By doing so, my dissertation makes a crucial intervention to human geography and critical urban theory by situating the capitalist production of urban pace in India within the unique historical geographies of the Indian Ocean rim.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 09/12/2024<br>\nModified by: Stephen&nbsp;J&nbsp;Young</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div
