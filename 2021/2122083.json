 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). \r\n\r\nComputer Science Standards for K-12 Education are being adopted widely, however there is much to be done before the standards are fully implemented, especially at the elementary level. After the release of Computer Science Teacher Association\u2019s K-12 Computer Science Standards in 2017, computer science (CS) educators began to develop a curriculum that is aligned with the standards in middle and secondary grades. A variety of middle school and high school level computer science curriculum materials (e.g., Exploring Computer Science, and Code.org) are available. However, there has been less attention paid to teaching CS in elementary school than in middle school and high school. Current elementary CS curriculum materials generally focus on programming without specific attention to physical computing (robotics), integration with other subjects, and the needs of English Learners (EL). For this reason, computer science should be meaningfully integrated with math, science, and rich literacy connections by considering the needs of growing EL population in the US elementary schools. \r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative project among University of Nevada Las Vegas, George Mason University, University of South Carolina Upstate and Weber State University. This project seeks to develop integrated CS curricula using affordances of educational robotics for grades 3-5 students in linguistically diverse classrooms; provide teacher professional development around classroom implementation of integrated units; and conduct educational research with regard to teacher outcomes (computer science teaching efficacy beliefs and teacher identity) and student outcomes (attainment of computer science concepts and practices, views of computer scientists, and computer scientist identity). This Research-Practitioner Partnership team consisting of computer science-science-literacy educators, two elementary teachers, and a doctoral graduate assistant will develop integrated computer science curricula for grades 3-5. In year 1, the project team will develop and test 3 integrated units. In year 2, each unit will be implemented in actual classroom settings by three teachers after receiving summer professional development. Then the units will be revised by the project team. In year 3, 35 elementary teachers will receive professional development about how to teach CS integrated with other subjects during summer and they will implement the units during the school year. This project will assist elementary school teachers in culturally, linguistically, and economically diverse communities of Clark County, Nevada, and Spartanburg, South Carolina, and the less culturally and linguistically diverse community of Davis County, Utah to successfully integrate CS into their classroom teaching. This project reflects the stance that CS should be meaningfully integrated with math, science, and rich literacy connections by considering ELs\u2019 funds of knowledge and English language proficiency (ELP) levels to extend all elementary school students\u2019, including ELs, exposure to CS before middle school. This approach would provide all students with equitable learning opportunities to access CS education and eventually cultivate their interest in computing fields.  The RPP will provide information to the field on the successes and challenges of engaging in this work and a program that is evidence-based through rigorous efficacy research. This project is supported by the CS for All: Research and RPPs program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
