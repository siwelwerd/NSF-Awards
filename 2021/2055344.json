 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to address local and regional workforce needs by increasing the number of certified advanced cloud computing technicians from the region. Cloud computing is a rapidly growing field that continues to change the nature of the information technology industry. Cloud-based solutions allow businesses to scale computing services to fit their needs and the needs of their users, while saving thousands of dollars on computing infrastructure costs and maintenance. As more businesses transition to cloud-based computing solutions, there is a critical need for an advanced cloud-computing workforce. To meet these needs, the project team will develop a new College Credit Certificate with advanced technical certifications in cloud-based technology. This project will serve a population of students who are predominantly low-income and minoritized. As a result, it has the potential to increase the number of certified cloud computing technicians from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis project will enhance advanced cloud and multi-cloud technology education by providing faculty with professional development opportunities that include obtaining cloud certifications from prominent Cloud platforms, creating a new advanced college-credit certificate with advanced technical certifications for students and working technicians, and encouraging collaboration through the virtual networking summit Cloud on Demand Series. In this project, Miami Dade College will partner with leading cloud solutions providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud to provide access, technical support, and training to faculty and students. The project aims to advance and share knowledge about student success and upskilling of STEM students at Hispanic-serving institutions. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
