 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanoscience and technology are playing an increasing role in fundamental research related to the engineering (e.g., mechanical, biomedical) and scientific (e.g., chemistry, biology) disciplines. To be able to observe and control phenomena at nanoscale, researchers need to be equipped with appropriate tools. This award will facilitate the acquisition of a specialized microscope used to visualize samples at very small dimensions. Students and faculty at Marshall University will use this microscope to gain fundamental knowledge in a range of important research projects. These include investigating calcium deposit in blood vessels, detecting toxic nanoparticles in human cells, water treatment to remove contamination, and in pharmaceutical manufacturing. This cutting-edge instrument will significantly advance the academic careers and research output of at least five faculty members. More than 100 mostly underrepresented students will be trained, under faculty mentorship, in modern engineering and scientific disciplines both during lectures, laboratory modules, and demonstrations. The incorporation of nanoscience and technology in the undergraduate and graduate curriculum will help training the future workforce, especially in the growing biotechnology arena in West Virginia.\r\n\r\nThis award enables Marshall University to purchase a CytoViva enhanced, high signal-to-noise darkfield optical microscope with an integrated hyperspectral imaging system. This instrument will be used to address fundamental knowledge gaps in highly multidisciplinary nanoscience and nanotechnology research projects at the university. The microscope produces a very high signal-to-noise ratio, enabling scatter detection of nanoscale materials at up to ten times greater than standard darkfield optics. The technology can image label-free nanoparticles and requires no sample preparation. Label-free nanoscale materials can then be spectrally identified based on their unique spectral properties within their target environment. The microscope will enable Marshall faculty in biomedical and mechanical science and engineering to accelerate their research contributions and improve teaching through innovative laboratory demonstrations and the integration of research and pedagogy. Researchers will use the instrument\u2019s capability to examine phenomena such as cell differentiation, understanding the environmental exposure to silver nanoparticles, label-free quantitation of short nucleic acids using Surface immobilized plasmonic sensors for RNA, nanoparticle aggregation in water treatment, and Brownian motion and aggregation of nanofluids.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Major Research Instrumentation Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
