 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Central Convergence Research Experiences for Undergraduates site will provide a transformative research experience for student participants. Hosted by the Department of Mathematics at Central Washington University, the REU will provide early training in mathematics research for future leaders in the mathematical sciences. Each research project, designed by research mentors who have training and expertise to produce high-quality research with undergraduate students, will be accessible to students with a calculus background. Through these well-designed research projects, problem-solving training, and other professional development support, students' tools and knowledge of the profession will be expanded to create a stronger sense of personal mathematical identity, including an individual understanding of diversity of the broader mathematical community. The program organizers will use long term relationships with national Math Alliance mentors and others to recruit and retain a diverse set of student participants, including students who identify from racial and cultural groups underrepresented in the field of mathematics.\r\n\r\nOn a multi-year basis, the Central Convergence Research Experiences for Undergraduates will cover a broad range of applied mathematical topics including mathematical biology, probability, economics, and financial mathematics. Three projects will be offered every year, with at least four students recruited to each project to work with a Central Washington University mathematics faculty mentor, for a total of 13 students per year. Interlaced with the mathematical research projects are professional development training, seminars by guest mathematicians, and field trips to local sites. Toward the end of the program, students will give a final presentation at a symposium and produce a written report suitable for publication. Students will also be supported in presenting their results at regional or national mathematics conferences after the summer program. The project will be evaluated with formative and summative assessments, and the program organizers will stay in contact and mentor students after each summer ends.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
