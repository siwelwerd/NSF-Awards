 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to support development of a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce. With the recent successes of space missions to other planets, space-based STEM learning tools will attract the attention of teachers, students, parents, and the public.  This project proposes a system to teach middle-school students about analysis, design, building and testing of small satellites. The system uses space-based systems as a compelling context to teach STEM concepts and methods. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project creates STEM insights using a satellite as the context.  For instance, a major challenge is accommodating the payload into a small stowed volume.  Miniaturization is sometimes a solution but may be limited by the physics.  For example, if a communications antenna exceeding the satellite size is desired, it must initially stow into a volume only on the order of a 10 cm cube.  Following stowage, it must be deployed on orbit reliably and with an accurate and precise shape.  The proposed lesson plan includes: preliminary concept design of a student-accessible small satellite, a teacher and student step-by-step lessons workbook on introductory remote sensing from space, physics of satellite orbits, and detailed software specifications to use gaming approaches for educational plans.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We completed the creation of three STEM-centric lesson plans designed to simulate remote sensing data from satellites flying in low earth orbit.  The lessons have been pilot-tested in several schools and received very positive feedback from teachers.  The lessons are designed to have a fun factor and to help the student realize that STEM involves only simple logical steps in the understanding of natural phenomena.  Lessons are designed, keyed to actual data derived from orbiting satellites such as close-to-real time live images and videos of the ice sheets, study of forest fire regimes, infrared images of rainforests and sunspot activities correlated with auroral activity, etc.  In the near future, actual satellite-derived images and video data will be made accessible to the students for study in the comfort of their classrooms.
