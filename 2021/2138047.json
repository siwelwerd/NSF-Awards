 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of Women in Cognitive Science is to improve the visibility of women in the field and to create an environment that invites discussion of the issues that all scientists, but women in particular, may be required to negotiate in the trajectory of creating and sustaining a successful career. A combination of online events, networking opportunities, and virtual or in-person workshops are designed for women in cognitive science, especially women in the early stages of their academic career. The workshops focus on building networks for success, promoting visibility of women scientists and their stories, and exploring pathways to academic and non-academic careers in cognitive science. A robust suite of online events will take place throughout the year and provide ongoing opportunities for women in cognitive science to build opportunities for research collaboration, seek mentoring across career stages, and engage in discussion of strategies for improving visibility and career advancement. \r\n\r\nVirtual and in-person workshops will take place at meetings of the Psychonomic Society, the Cognitive Science Society, the Association for Psychological Sciences, and the American Psychological Association. The workshops will take the form of public forums with invited speaker-panelists to initiate discussion about best practices for the professional advancement of women in cognitive science at the individual and institutional level. These workshops will include online engagement to increase exposure, and will also feature \"speed-mentoring\" for personalized assistance to early career researchers. By partnering with established societies, the WiCS group will maximize the opportunity for systemic change that addresses the career challenges of a group that continues to be underrepresented in senior academic and industry positions in the cognitive sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
