 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description: This project will use NSF support to increase student participation and enhance technical training at the 79th Device Research Conference (DRC), which brings together researchers from around the world to share their latest findings in the areas of electronic, opto-electronic, and quantum-based semiconductor devices. The 2021 DRC will be held virtually from June 20 to 23, 2021, and all participants will join remotely. The DRC offers unique training and networking opportunities particularly to its student and young investigator attendees, helping them advance their careers in materials science, semiconductor technology, and device engineering. The DRC is committed to fostering greater diversity and equity for all attendees and at all levels. By stimulating an open and frank discussion of recent breakthroughs and advances in electronic and photonic devices, the DRC will remove barriers for underrepresented minority groups and also support the NSF\u2019s Diversity Mission related to \u201cpreparing a diverse, globally engaged science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce.\u201d \r\n\r\nTechnical Description: The 2021 DRC will feature three plenary talks from world-renowned researchers in heterogeneous integration, III-nitride technology, and van der Waals materials. The conference will include presentations on devices for IoT, spintronic devices, memory devices, RF and terahertz devices, thin-film devices, and heterogeneous integration. In addition to plenary talks and oral presentations, the 2021 DRC will offer a half-day technical shortcourse in the area of \u201cQuantum Computing Devices and Materials\u201d taught by prominent experts from academia and industry. The 2021 DRC will also feature a rump session titled \u201cFerroelectric-based devices: What is the future?\u201d to engage the audience in a vigorous and open discussion on the future of ferroelectric devices. The conference program, including the rump session and the shortcourse, will greatly enhance the usefulness of the conference to all attendees. The information will be disseminated through online video presentations, downloadable posters and the conference proceedings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
