 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Colgate University is acquiring a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer to support Professor George Geier and colleagues Ernest Nolen, Jacob Goldberg and Jennifer Peeler. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species in complex samples. MALDI TOF combines gentle ionization (ideal for producing intact ions of peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, synthetic polymers, and other similarly sized species) with a detection mode that offers an excellent balance between sensitivity and accuracy across a wide mass range. This highly sensitive technique allows identification and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the university and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students with this modern analytical technique. It is also used by collaborators at Hamilton College.\r\n\r\nThe award of the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It is especially useful to determine masses of synthetic glycopeptide mimics and their synthetic intermediates and for the development of chemical probes tethered to short peptides to detect zinc(II) ions in the nervous system.  The instrumentation is also used for monitoring the progress of peptide synthesis reactions, as well as for identifying products obtained via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based separations emanating from synthetic ventures. The instrument also serves researchers assessing expression of human selenoproteins via genetic code expansion, and carrying out assays of selenoprotein enzymatic activity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
