 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is an improvement in motor vehicle safety by providing drivers with critical navigational information without requiring them to look away from the road. The project uses novel display technologies to place useful information within the drivers' fields of view. This innovation also promises greater accessibility to navigational information for drivers. This project also has the potential to address the use of novel display devices for industries such as first responders and in construction.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project develops research into the use of projective augmented reality display devices in the built environment. Specifically, this project explores the potential of utilizing such devices to deliver information inside motor vehicles. The technical features of this innovation overcome limitations of other augmented reality and navigation display devices, such as head mounted displays and screens. These limitations include the provision of unnecessary information, the need for user to take attention away from their real-world settings, and a reduction in the user's field of view. The project will provide user insights related to the technical and design constraints for the different use-cases and will explore the potential value propositions of the technology. These insights will also inform the engineering design of electronics, casing, and software user interface of the platform.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
