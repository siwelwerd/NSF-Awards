 "awd_abstract_narration": "PREACT (Planning for Resilience and Equity through Accessible Community Technology) is a multipurpose and multi-scalar climate preparedness and neighborhood planning software application informed by community needs and assets, to be piloted in the city of Philadelphia. While most planning tools are designed and built in a top-down manner, centering software developers and planners, this project will articulate a framework for technology co-production that fully takes into account the needs and experiences of community members and allows for the integration of social and scientific data for more informed decision-making. PREACT will enable users to specify a geographical area of interest, choose from and weigh the importance of a range of factors relevant to a climate planning concern, and generate a map indicating areas of greatest vulnerability. PREACT will also help identify ways to systematically address vulnerabilities through support for existing community assets (like parks and other greenspace), opportunities to reinvest in social, ecological, and physical infrastructure in communities, better local enforcement of existing public health regulations, and changes in land-use decisions and planning. The inclusion of resident groups in the creation of PREACT ensures that the data and assumptions that underpin PREACT reflect community need and lived experience. Through the process of designing and using PREACT, we anticipate creating opportunities for a more deliberative dialogue among residents, scholars, government, and business about needs and preferences for policy interventions and infrastructure investments. The goal is to co-create a socio-ecological and technological tool that promotes climate resiliency, empowers residents, and makes the government more responsive to community needs.\r\n\r\nPREACT will be designed using a co-design process for the development of an interactive planning and data visualization tool to help educate the diverse stakeholder of the trade-off associated with decision making and investments for climate preparedness and adaptation. Through a series of community design workshops and the creation of more specialized working groups, the project will produce (a) a data collection plan that outlines the desired inputs including environmental data, citizen-science data, energy data, socioeconomic data, and data on neighborhood amenities and risk factors, and how they might be collected; (b) a data integration plan for how to incorporate the various data sets and forms into PREACT software, including the quantification of qualitative measures and a model for understanding the ways that factors interact with each other; (c) a software development and data visualization plan involving a series of wireframes detailing how PREACT software will work, addressing both how users interact with the software and how the data integration, visualization, and analysis will be carried out; and (d) a community-engagement plan detailing methods for further engagement of community members as citizen scientists and planners for the implementation of PREACT.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The project was created to conceptualize and prototype a decision-making tool that helps empower community members by documenting and visualizing their lived experience, and developing a technology platform that facilitates making the government more responsive to community needs.

Students from Temple University, West Chester University, and MIT collaborated on the development of six prototype applications representing different functionalities for integration into the final PREACT application. The process of developing a PREACT Advisory Committee and working with them and other community members over the course of the project in an iterative process provides a framework for other community-engaged research projects.

This has included both qualitative data on the lived experiences of community members and fine-scale data on neighborhood conditions, neither of which are currently captured in the official data sets informing planning decisions. Using low-cost Purple Air monitors, the Clean Air Council and other PREACT partners have worked to pilot the deployment of Purple Air monitors in environmental justice communities across the city of Philadelphia. The Purple Air monitors can be used as a means of local air quality monitoring for PM 2.5 and PM 10, temperature, and humidity. By deploying them in communities, residents are better able to observe air quality trends in their neighborhoods and compare their air quality with other parts of the city. In addition, the PREACT project has found use cases for the Purple Air monitors where the city-wide air monitoring is not picking up more localized emergency air quality concerns such as trash, tire, and junkyard fires, which are more common that would be expected in Philadelphia. Throughout the project, we have been in discussions with municipal officials and community leaders about strategies to use local air monitoring as a means of both education and advocacy and a way to more effectively monitor the air.</p>\n<p>The project additionally engaged local K-12 teachers through a training course to develop curricula for the data collection and other educational activities in school settings.</p>\n<p>The project directly benefits local and national interests through enhancing equitable resilience planning for climate change, leveraging university resources and data science to address climate risks, alleviating the aftermath of extreme events, and preventing life-threatening risks due to extreme weather events. The proposed synergistic, interdisciplinary PREACT software application and community participation model will provide a much-needed platform for collective decision-making and enhancing underserved communities&rsquo; preparedness for climate change.</p>\n<p>The PREACT proof-of-concept developed for application in specific Philadelphia neighborhoods serves as a test case for the development and application of the PREACT model in other cities and regions across the country. We have demonstrated how in one city, struggling to meet current community needs and plan for climate, we can use a process of working with communities to identify data gaps and develop data tools.</p>\n<p>The PREACT planning grant developed the framework and network of academics and community partners that will enable the full prototyping and implementation of the PREACT application as a follow-up project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/26/2024<br>\nModified by: Christina&nbsp;D&nbsp;Rosan</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div
