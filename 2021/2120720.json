 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing a novel support structure for students in algebra and trigonometry classes that aligns with other STEM courses in their major area of study.  As is true at many institutions, an increasing number of students at Valparaiso University (Valpo) benefit from additional efforts to build mathematics skills upon entering college. However, traditional models that require students to take \u201cremedial\u201d prerequisites delay students taking courses in their intended major. This often causes students to leave STEM major pathways, take longer to attain their degrees, or leave college altogether. Valpo students will be able to start taking courses for their intended degree immediately upon entering college, while at the same time taking corequisite skill-building mathematics courses. The major activities of this project will focus on the structural reorganization of the paired mathematics and partner discipline courses, along with the professional development of faculty teaching these critical early courses. Over fifty course offerings in more than ten different departments will be impacted.  This broad-scale approach will ensure that nearly all students get the opportunity to pursue their college degree in a timely fashion while building the mathematical skills necessary for success. Project research will examine how this two-phase corequisite model impacts participating students\u2019 academic outcomes, self-efficacy, and sense of belonging.  \r\n\r\nIn Phase 1, the project will launch and evaluate an interdisciplinary Math+Major corequisite model that allows foundational mathematics, learned using the ALEKS software system, to be taken concurrently with a quantitative course needed for the student\u2019s major. In Phase 2, students will be offered the opportunity to replace the traditional one-semester Calculus I with a two-semester \u201cCalculus Plus\u201d course. The new course will serve 20-30 STEM majors each year that would benefit from intensive help with algebra and trigonometry in order to succeed in calculus. The Calculus Plus course will incorporate discipline-specific assignments to engage students with diverse STEM interests and will incorporate active learning approaches and mastery-based grading. Mathematics and STEM faculty will collaborate to design modules to engage students through direct application of mathematical concepts to several majors. These changes are expected to increase students\u2019 ability to understand important mathematical concepts and their relevance to other disciplines, pursue their desired majors, and graduate on time. Valpo faculty will learn new methods and skills to engage and support students, including groups underrepresented in STEM, by participating in Faculty Learning Communities. The project will generate new knowledge by comparing student success measures to prior approaches and through a mixed-methods effort to explore how the Math+Major and Calculus Plus models impact students\u2019 self-efficacy and sense of belonging. Major data sources include surveys and interviews of participating students and faculty. Valpo will disseminate the project\u2019s models, curricula, and outcomes through local workshops and national conferences. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
