The workshop will be held in the Spring of 2021 and will be virtually conducted. It is expected that there will be approximately 300 attendees. The workshop will take place over 2-3 days to account for a wide variety of time zones and the participants\u2019 existing commitments with teaching, family life balance, and research. The workshop will include interactive sessions on good proposal-writing practices, seminars by previous CAREER awardees, a mock CAREER proposal panel review. The attendees will also have an opportunity to interact with current NSF Program Directors. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will help to prepare CAREER program-eligible faculty for careers in education and research by giving them tools and skills of good proposal-writing for submissions to the CAREER program as well as core NSF ENG programs. The objectives of the workshop include training for junior faculty with an emphasis on women and underrepresented minorities in engineering. A special additional emphasis will be placed on encouraging CAREER program eligible faculty from non-\"Research-1\" institutions and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to apply for participation. The workshop will serve as an introduction to NSF for many new researchers. The workshop will help participants to clarify their research and education career plans and to understand the need to clearly articulate these plans to external reviewers. In addition, the workshop includes mock panel sessions to give participants the experience of simulated panel evaluation discussions. All of the content and experiences will help attendees enrich their skills for writing successful research proposals on impactful research that benefits societal needs. The PIs of the grant plan to evaluate past ENG CAREER workshops for best practices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe objective of the 2021 NSF ENG Directorate Workshop was to introduce junior faculty who are interested in submitting their NSF CAREER proposals to the Directorate for Engineering to the Program.\n\n\nThe goal of the Workshop was to provide early-career faculty members the opportunity to improve their skills in proposal writing, interact with NSF program directors from different ENG divisions (CBET, ECCS, CMMI and EEC) and with recent NSF CAREER awardees. The Workshop was open to multidisciplinary researchers with an ENG focus. The major sessions of the Workshop were to include presentations on proposal writing, mock panels, and networking.\n\n\nOver 880 applications were received for the virtual workshop. 855 junior faculty were registered to attend the general sessions held April 21st and 23rd. Only 35% of the registrants (301 junior faculty) were selected for the mock panel session on April 22, 2021.\n\n\nThe Mock Panel participants were divided into 30 panels (approximately 10 participants per panel) to review and rate four previously funded and non-funded NSF ENG CAREER proposals. The Workshop participants were able to critique past successful and unsuccessful NSF CAREER proposals. At the panel each of the proposals were placed in a funding category and ranked. The results of each panel were compared and discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the conference, participants were asked to complete an online evaluation survey. A total of 254 participants completed the workshop evaluation and 165 participants completed the mock panel session. The majority of respondents (77.94%) have never submitted a CAREER proposal to the National Science Foundation, and the majority intended to submit a CAREER proposal that year.\n\n\nThe workshop was rated positively: 78.74% strongly agreed that the workshop was valuable, and 83.46% strongly agreed that they would recommend it to a friend. Survey results also indicated that 64% of the respondents strongly agreed they were more prepared to write an NSF CAREER proposal after attending the workshop.\n\n\nEffectiveness of the Workshops\n\n\nThe objective of the survey of past participants was to assess the effectiveness of the Workshops held in the Directorate for Engineering since 2005. In December 2022, a survey link was emailed to over 4,000 past NSF CAREER participants that attended a workshop held between 2005  2020. The email was successfully delivered to 3,518 email addresses.\n\n\nThe survey link was engaged by 395 participants (11% of the participants that received the email). 383 participants consented to participate in the survey and 12 participants did not consent. A majority of the responses (78%) were from participants that attended a workshop within five years of the survey, of which 70% were assistant professors.\n\n\nThe participants were asked if they received any awards after attending the Workshop. 67% reported that they received at least one award. Of the participants that received an award, 76% received at least one non-NSF award, and, 82% received an NSF award. Additional responses indicated that about 70% of non-NSF awards were under $500,000. Approximately 70% of NSF awards received were between $250,000 and $749,000.\n\n\nA majority of the respondents (80.1%) indicated the workshop was beneficial.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RosemarieWesson\n"
