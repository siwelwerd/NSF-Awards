 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past few decades there have been an increasing number of issues related to the geosciences including, but not limited to climate, natural hazards, energy resources, and contaminant input to marine systems. Simultaneously, there has been a significant decrease in geoscience training at the undergraduate level, and very little diversity. Consequently, there are few well-defined pathways for students to enter the geosciences at critical junctures. The goal of this project is to increase the number and diversity of students entering the geosciences workforce by increasing awareness, accessibility and enhancing pathways into the geosciences. The primary objective is to integrate ongoing research with new and unique undergraduate courses, to build core geoscience competencies, and by developing those competencies, enhance pathways for diverse cohorts of undergraduates to thrive in geoscience careers. This is executed through two new applied research courses offered at EC entitled \u201cScientist at Sea\u201d (S-A-S), which consist of on-campus and off-campus (research cruise) components, as well as peer mentorship, professional productivity, and networking opportunities. This program will be integrated with a new college initiative \u201cDiversifying the Marine Science Pipeline\u201d which will facilitate the recruitment and retention of a more diverse student population to geoscience careers. \r\n\r\nThis project will prepare a more diverse group of undergraduate students, most of whom already possess a strong interest in the marine sciences, to pursue careers in the geosciences. It is well documented that culturally-relevant, problem-based research experiences, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which serves as the foundation of this project, can be a very successful recruitment tool. This project provides early exposure for students to obtain research experiences at a critical juncture in their education for determining career paths. The project also proposes to increase the skills and quality of graduating students, and quantity of students continuing into geoscience careers (higher-education/academia, industry, government). The project revolves around a series of new applied research courses entitled \u201cScientist at Sea\u201d (S-A-S), to be offered at EC, including a research cruise experience, peer mentorship and professional productivity opportunities, that encompass practical applied skills for planning, execution, and professional products associated with research. Specific activities include: 1) science communication and outreach, 2) research cruise design, planning, and implementation, and 3) networking, collaborating with professionals in academia, government, private industry and other stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
