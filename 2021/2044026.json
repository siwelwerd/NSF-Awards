 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project presents SMILIES (Shared MicromobIlity for affordabLe-accessIblE houSing): a community-engaged pilot project to improve the accessibility to jobs and essential activities for affordable housing communities in small- and mid-sized cities and rural areas by leveraging the explosive growth of shared micromobility (SMM) services. Affordable-accessible housing for working families is increasingly scarce in the U.S., in particular for small- and mid-sized cities and rural areas. As many small- and mid-sized cities offer only limited public transportation options, low-income residents living in those areas may struggle to access jobs, and critical goods and services. The SMILIES project will deploy SMMs in a mid-sized city to establish the business, operating, and sociodemographic conditions under which SMM can improve accessibility to jobs and essential activities (e.g., schools, shopping, recreation, and health care) for affordable housing communities. Defining such conditions will facilitate the development and evaluation of new, highly effective and cost-effective policies and strategies that will help cities and planning agencies leverage SMM while ensuring equitable distribution of these services.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of this project is to determine the degree of impact that SMM services can have on accessibility to jobs and essential activities, household transportation costs, and energy consumption for residents of affordable housing communities in small- and mid-sized cities, and rural areas. This objective will be accomplished by developing a community-engaged research-centered pilot project in the City of Fort Smith, Arkansas. The specific objective of this planning grant proposal is to strengthen collaborations with relevant stakeholders, solidify academic and civic team members\u2019 roles, and refine the vision and plan for executing this research-centered pilot project. This project is transformative as it will leverage community engagement (residents, decision makers, operators) to first define acceptable conditions for SMM and then conduct real-world pilot deployments of SMM under the community-defined conditions.\r\n\r\nThis project is in response to Track A \u2013 CIVIC Innovation Challenge - Communities and Mobility a collaboration with NSF and the Department of Energy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The study collected baseline data to identify community-specific strengths, needs, and barriers regarding access to transportation and select high-priority neighborhoods for SMM deployments. The community transportation needs assessment survey found that more than 50% of respondents reported challenges accessing transportation services to travel to work/places every day. For lower-income populations (Annual household income &lt;$34,000), this rose to 65%, with many reporting that they do not own a car or are challenged by limited public transportation options. Further, many of these communities are living in food deserts and have limited access to education and healthcare. Moreover, the survey found that more than 70% of low-income (more than 50% overall) people are interested in using shared micromobility in Fort Smith. The survey findings and the activities conducted during the planning grant helped the project team prepare the Stage 2 proposal submitted to the National Science Foundation for the full award consideration.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The project has increased partnership between academia, transportation professionals, industry operators, and regulatory agencies.

Workshops during this grant have strengthened this partnership, which will extend past the performance period of this project to define a path for future collaborations.
