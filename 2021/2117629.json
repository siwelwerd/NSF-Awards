 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description:\r\nAn Atomic Force Microscopy-Infrared Spectroscopy (AFM-IR) system enables researchers to image samples with nanometer precision while collecting chemical, optical, mechanical and surface morphology information at the same time. This opens exciting new possibilities for multidisciplinary analysis and allows investigators to extend their research into new scientific directions and answer advanced fundamental science and engineering questions at the nanoscale. The instrument's versatility, non-destructive nature, and ability to operate under controlled conditions (e.g., temperature, hydration, etc.) make it suitable for widespread use with materials that range from delicate biological systems to rigid and engineered materials. AFM-IR represents a new and emerging technology. At Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), the instrument supports faculty and students from four schools (Science, Engineering & Technology, Medicine, and Dentistry) by providing capabilities for interdisciplinary scientific discovery, workforce training, and use in teaching and K-12 outreach efforts. Importantly, its placement within the Integrated Nanosystems Development Institute's shared nanoscale characterization facility at IUPUI allows the AFM-IR to serve as a resource for external and industry users to boost innovation and collaboration throughout the region. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nBy combining atomic force microscopy, nanoscale infrared spectroscopy, and scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy in a single platform, the acquired AFM-IR system enables ultrafast imaging and nanoscale mapping of morphological and mechanical characteristics, as well as chemical and optical properties. The latter are the result of an IR beam being focused onto an AFM tip, and either the dissipation of the material (via cantilever deflection caused by photothermal expansion) or the backscattered signal is detected to yield nanoscale spectroscopic data. Deflection is easily induced in soft and/or biological samples, whereas harder samples can scatter a sufficient amount of light. Together, this creates a powerful tool for characterizing samples that span soft to rigid, and enables the ability to perform hyperspectral imaging (where a complete infrared spectrum is obtained at every pixel, at a spatial resolution of 10nm) or absorption maps at different wavenumbers, all while retaining the capabilities of the full-featured atomic force microscope that the system is built around. As a result, the AFM-IR serves a team of investigators with current research spanning the design/characterization of novel bionanosensors, nanocarriers, and nanomaterials for energy applications, to the fundamental biology of ligand damage, bone loading, and wound healing, to industrial process development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The placement of the atomic force microscope-infrared (AFM-IR) instrument within INDI&rsquo;s shared nanoscale characterization facility has significantly broadened its impact, benefiting internal and external researchers, local industry, and the broader community through its integration into outreach programs. The NSF-MRI project (Award Number: 2117629) supported the acquisition of an AFM-IR system (BRUKER &ndash; IconIR), a cutting-edge tool for nanoscale physicochemical characterization. This instrument synergizes the nanoscale resolution of AFM with the molecular identification capabilities of IR. This instrument can deliver high performance AFM imaging, high-resolution (&lt;10 nm) chemical analysis, monolayer sensitivity and ultimate sample flexibility. It is also capable of correlative chemical imaging with PeakForce Tapping using both nanomechanical and nanoelectrical modes.</p>\r\n<p>The AFM-IR within the nanoscale characterization facility at INDI officially opened to researchers in April 2023 and has since become an essential resource with a growing user base. Currently, the instrument supports the research of 15 faculty members across Schools including Engineering &amp; Technology, Science, Medicine, and Dentistry. These faculty members include three women, two minority researchers, and seven early-career faculty. These researchers, all engaged in funded projects, utilize the AFM-IR for diverse applications ranging from novel nanomaterials design to industrial process development and fundamental biological studies. Although there have been delays in installation and training, there are several ongoing projects and future manuscripts are anticipated highlighting the science from the use of AFM-IR.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the AFM-IR instrument is assisting researchers in pursuing multidisciplinary research by i) performing chemical analysis at the nanoscale to investigate heterogeneous materials, composite interfaces, and nanoscale defects, in turn advancing the understanding and development of high-performance materials; ii) executing chemical and structural analysis of polymer blends and films, aiding in the fabrication of innovative materials for packaging, electronics, and medical applications; iii) helping researchers to study biomolecular structures and drug interactions with unprecedented resolution, thus accelerating developments in drug delivery and protein analysis; and iv) examining nanostructures and interfaces in energy storage and conversion materials, thereby contributing to advancements in battery technology and sustainable energy solutions.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond research, the AFM-IR plays an important role in educational and professional development. As faculty users are exceptionally active in student mentoring, the AFM-IR has an everlasting impact on the training of post-doctoral researchers, as well as graduate and undergraduate students. A particularly noteworthy achievement is the successful training of students, both at the graduate and undergraduate levels, to operate the AFM-IR independently. This level of autonomy underscores the instrument&rsquo;s accessibility and the effectiveness of the training provided, empowering students to take ownership of their projects and contribute meaningfully to innovative research. Furthermore, the AFM-IR is seamlessly integrated into student coursework across various disciplines, including nanotechnology, materials science, physics, chemistry, and life sciences. This integration ensures that students gain theoretical and practical insights into nanoscale chemical characterization and its applications.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;In addition, the AFM-IR has aided in our goal of promoting STEM interest among K-12 students through community outreach activities. The instrument is utilized throughout IU&rsquo;s expansive NSF-funded outreach efforts, which include Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and Research Experience for Teachers (RET) sites/programs dedicated to nanomaterials design and characterization. Students participating in REU programs are majorly from limited research colleges and universities. Importantly, due to IU Indianapolis&rsquo;s unique location within the metropolitan area, K-12 participants are predominately from partnering high needs high schools with large populations of traditionally underrepresented students. Exposure to this type of instrumentation builds excitement within these students and encourages higher learning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Beyond internal users, the AFM-IR facility at INDI is accessible to support external users of neighboring institutions and industries. For example, several local companies including MITO Materials Solutions have expressed significant interest in the use of this advanced instrumentation. Nevertheless, the AFM-IR instrument facility strengthened INDI, creating a hub for advanced nanoscience research and providing critical infrastructure for AFM-IR analysis that supports both academic and industrial collaborations.</p>\r\n<p>In summary, during the period of this award, the AFM-IR system was successfully installed, with specialized training programs developed and delivered to users. The instrument has become an integral part of research, education, and outreach efforts. It provides advanced characterization capabilities and cutting-edge training to scientists, engineers, educators, and students, benefiting individuals across campus and throughout the surrounding region.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/29/2024<br>\nModified by: Mangilal&nbsp;Agarwal</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2117629/2117629_10763208_1735501097447_AFM_IR_Picture_and_Specification--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2117629/2117629_10763208_1735501097447_AFM_IR_Picture_and_Specification--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"AFM-IR Picture and Specification\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2117629/2117629_10763208_1735501097447_AFM_IR_Picture_and_Specification--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"AFM-IR Picture and Specification\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">AFM-IR Picture and Specification</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mangilal Agarwal</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mangilal&nbsp;Agarwal\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">AFM-IR Picture and Specification</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2117629/2117629_10763208_1735501278417_AFM_IR_Picture_Postdocs_and_Graduate_Student--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2117629/2117629_10763208_1735501278417_AFM_IR_Picture_Postdocs_and_Graduate_Student--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Postdocs and Graduate Students using AFM-IR\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2117629/2117629_10763208_1735501278417_AFM_IR_Picture_Postdocs_and_Graduate_Student--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Postdocs and Graduate Students using AFM-IR\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Postdocs and Graduate Students using the AFM-IR funded by the NSF-MRI award.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mangilal Agarwal</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mangilal&nbsp;Agarwal\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Postdocs and Graduate Students using AFM-IR</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2117629/2117629_10763208_1735501614534_Undergraduate_Students_Training--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2117629/2117629_10763208_1735501614534_Undergraduate_Students_Training--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Undergraduate Students Getting Trained\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2117629/2117629_10763208_1735501614534_Undergraduate_Students_Training--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Undergraduate Students Getting Trained\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Undergraduate Students getting trained to use the AFM-IR</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mangilal Agarwal</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mangilal&nbsp;Agarwal\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Undergraduate Students Getting Trained</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2117629/2117629_10763208_1735501426798_AFM_IR_Picture_Undergraduate_Students--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2117629/2117629_10763208_1735501426798_AFM_IR_Picture_Undergraduate_Students--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Undergraduate Students using AFM-IR\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2117629/2117629_10763208_1735501426798_AFM_IR_Picture_Undergraduate_Students--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Undergraduate Students using AFM-IR\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Undergraduate Students using AFM-IR funded by the NSF-MRI award.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mangilal Agarwal</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mangilal&nbsp;Agarwal\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Undergraduate Students using AFM-IR</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
