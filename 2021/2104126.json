 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EPSCoR workshop proposal supports the development, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of two virtual Gatherings to Transcend Barriers to Success (GTBS) at the University of Arkansas in May 2021, and at Idaho State University in September 2021. These Gatherings will provide a platform for dialogue with current NSF programming focused on the development of Native American STEM students and professionals and their communities. This project builds on findings from a three-year Keck Foundation project entitled, \u201cTranscending Barriers to Success (TBS): Connecting Indigenous and Western Knowledge Systems to Tackle Grand Challenges,\u201d and engagement models deployed in other EPSCoR jurisdictions. The Gatherings have the enthusiastic support of the EPSCoR community. Workshop products will include a University of Arkansas Resiliency Center monograph, a Bannock Shoshone higher education STEM pathway monograph, an iterative \u201cConnecting Indigenous Knowledge and Western Science\u201d bibliography, and a project report. All four products will be valuable resources for EPSCoR jurisdictions seeking new and innovative ways to engage indigenous students, professionals and communities. Products will combine oral reflection and text narratives.\r\n\r\nThe Gatherings will be rooted in the concept of \u201cTwo-Eyed Seeing\u201d which stresses the importance of viewing the world through an indigenous eye and a western eye to see together and advance the progress of science, prosperity, health and well-being. Since 2000, an increasing number of relevant frameworks link indigenous and western knowledge systems, including: traditional ecological knowledge, biocultural restoration, cultural ecosystems, co-management, native science, culturally responsive education, and collective continuance and community engagement in response to climate change. Funds of Knowledge and Cultural Wealth Theories provide broader frameworks.  The Gatherings will catalyze research and education capabilities derived from indigenous knowledge and western science resulting in new contributions to scientific discovery, innovation, learning, and knowledge-based prosperity in numerous EPSCoR jurisdictions and nationally. The Gatherings will make visible and relevant connections between indigenous knowledge and western science leading to reforms in curricular and educational practice that are supportive of STEM success for indigenous and all students. Developing durable, continuing partnerships between indigenous communities and campuses will advance these reforms and supports into the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
