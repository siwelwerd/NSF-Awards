 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Algebraic Combinatorics Virtual Expedition (AlCoVE) is a two-day conference for mathematicians studying the interplay between algebra and combinatorics and their applications to other areas of mathematics and science.  At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, AlCoVE was launched as a way to bring together the algebra and combinatorics communities in a virtual setting.  We aimed to re-create as many of the beneficial aspects of in-person conferences as possible, including the mentoring and networking benefits that conferences usually provide.  The 2020 conference drew hundreds of participants from all around the world, and we are now continuing to run AlCoVE as an annual online conference, improving our virtual social events through technology funded by the NSF.  AlCoVE strives to be an inclusive, global conference that promotes collaboration and progress in this field, while simultaneously increasing accessibility and helping to reduce the carbon footprint of mathematics research.\r\n\r\nAlCoVE 2021, to be held on June 14-15, will feature presentations on a wide array of topics in algebraic combinatorics and its applications.  These topics include enumeration, lattices and posets, generating functions and q-series, symmetric function theory, computational algebraic geometry, polytopes and Ehrhart theory, combinatorial optimization, and topological combinatorics.  There will be a poster session for younger researchers to share their work as well, and dynamic social events to foster networking, collaboration, and social events. The website for the conference is http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~opecheni/alcove.htm\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nAlCoVE, the Algebraic Combinatorics Virtual Expedition, was a two-day online mathematics conference run in June 2021, a sequel to the first edition run the previous summer. The conference?s scope was international, with 346 registered participants from 40 countries around the world, including participants from 39 of the 50 US states.  \nThe conference featured twelve speakers presenting new research in algebraic combinatorics, as well as a virtual poster session with eighteen posters for younger participants. The talks were recorded and made available electronically in perpetuity. The NSF grant further allowed us to provide high-quality virtual social events between the talks, which provided networking benefits similar to in-person conferences. \nIntellectual Merit:\nAlgebraic combinatorics focuses on the interplay of algebra, geometry, and combinatorics, in order to solve combinatorial problems using algebraic methods and vice versa.  The area has strong connections with and important applications to many other fields of mathematics and science, including enumeration, discrete geometry, graph theory, symmetric function theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, computational mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and high-energy physics.\n\nAlCoVE brought together experts in these areas in conversation with experts from neighboring fields and many younger researchers. \nBroader Impacts:\nIn 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic restricted travel, and so AlCoVE provided an accessible venue for mathematicians around the world to come together and share their ideas.  This had the additional benefit of being inclusive of mathematicians who usually cannot travel to international conferences for other reasons as well. \nAlCoVE also provided a blueprint for sustainable conferences in the long run, enabling mathematicians to learn ways to reduce their carbon footprint while still doing productive mathematics together.\n\nOf our twelve speakers, six (50%) were women, and 33% of the conference participants who reported their gender self-identified as a gender other than male.  Students made up 43% of all participants, and 14% were postdoctoral researchers.  Of those who responded about ethnicity/race, 10.5% identified as Hispanic or Latino, 27.6% identified as Asian, 2.9% identified as Black or African, and there were two American Indigenous participants.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/21/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laura Colmenarejo Hernando"
