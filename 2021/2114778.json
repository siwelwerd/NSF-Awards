 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant will document and investigate the deployment and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines as a large-scale complex extreme logistics event.  Given the unique unprecedented scale, magnitude and urgency of this operation, and its fast-moving nature, it is imperative to document its development and deployment, and extract lessons for the planning, design and operation of future extreme logistical operations.  Controlling the virus through vaccination will normalize economic and social life in the US and around the world, reopening vital local, regional, and international economies.  Given the huge toll of lost lives, productivity and economic output, along with poor educational and mental health outcomes, it is imperative to take stock of the vaccine deployment process, extracting lessons for future extreme logistical operations including future pandemics, health threats, and responses to major natural and man-made disasters. \r\n\r\nThis study will document in real-time the state of the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain, including vaccination rates over time, provide interim guidance for the latter portions of the continuing deployment process, and extract lessons learned and principles for the robust design and resilient operation of future extreme logistics deployments, including other health-related crises and disaster response situations.  The study findings will help address questions about (1) the capacity of the US logistics system and overall biopharma supply chain to deliver vaccine at the desired scale and in the desired urgent time frame, (2) the time frames required to reach target vaccination levels, (3)  the main vulnerabilities in the vaccine supply chain and distribution process, (4) resilience of the overall supply chain viz. disruptions due to various sources, (5) equity of the logistical processes in terms of reaching traditionally underserved populations, and (6) the value of real-time information in enhancing the robustness and resilience of extreme logistics processes and building public trust in these processes. This work will be further informed by an advisory board of experts and stakeholders engaged in the distribution process. The scientific significance arises from the unprecedented scale, urgency and complexity of the logistics processes, featuring (a) decisions made by multiple interacting agents from considerably different domains, (b) many sources of stochasticity and disruption potential, (c) strongly interacting network elements with potential for cascading failure, and (d) hierarchical processes featuring strong centralized control at upper levels with highly decentralized loose coupling at lower levels.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

An operation of such scale, magnitude and urgency requires a complex, global network of transport and logistics facilities and services. The logistical processes must move not only vaccines, but ancillary equipment such as syringes and dry ice for refrigeration to enable vaccination at desired rates within its limited shelf life. Given the unique unprecedented and fast-moving nature of this operation, this RAPID project set out to document its development and deployment, and extract lessons for the planning, design and operation of future extreme logistical operations. Thus the objectives of this project were to: (1) investigate the development and deployment of the Covid 19 vaccine as a large-scale, complex extreme logistics event; (2) document in real-time the state of the Covid 19 vaccine supply chain, including tracking of vaccination rates over time, and disseminate through a public dashboard; (3) Extract lessons learned and principles for the robust design and resilient operation of future extreme logistics deployments, including other health-related crises and disaster response situations. In particular, the study has helped address the following critical question: (1) what is the capacity of the US logistics system and overall biopharma supply chain to deliver vaccine at the desired scale and in the desired urgent time frame?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The primary findings of the study include:</p>\n<p>1. The overall vaccine logistics system of the U.S. performed at very high levels when it comes to moving the vaccine from manufacturers to the state and local levels. Very few delays were encountered in actually moving and delivering the vaccine to the responsible local agencies-- usually due to winter weather disruption and not exceeding a couple of days.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the refrigeration and packaging aspects worked remarkably well, with near insignificant losses due to perishability or damage in transit.</p>\n<p>2. On the other hand, the last mile issues were very significant, and exhibited very high variability across jurisdictions. Different states and cities varied markedly in their ability to actually deploy and use the quantities of vaccine that were delivered to them. Most jurisdictions were only able to use 60 to 70 percent of the allocations they were receiving at any given time. Very few jurisdictions appear to have performed analyses to evaluate different last mile dissemination channels; it was a learn-as-you-go process at considerable cost and inefficiency from the standpoint of the end users.</p>\n<p>3. The study uncovered and modeled two distinct regimes in the vaccine distribution process: (1) capacity constrained, generally by local vaccination capacity, resulting in large delays for users; and (2) demand constrained, where hesitancy reduced the anticipated demand rate and the vaccination rate exceeded the demand. Under the latter regime, considerable variation across geographic areas resulted in opportunities for sharing and reallocating resources between high-hesitancy and low-availability areas. While some areas exploited and leveraged these imbalances to achieve greater overall efficiency, many did not and ended up wasting valuable resources.</p>\n<p>4. The study<strong>&nbsp;</strong>uncovered critical factors affecting both vaccination rate and vaccine hesitancy; these include regional differences, degree of urbanization, and political attitudes as reflected by local voting records.</p>\n<p>5. An international comparison of vaccination rates using a rigorous statistical methodology revealed that participation in multi-governmental collaborations such as COVAX improves the ability to vaccinate. Similarly, transportation and accessibility variates such as roads per area for low-income countries and rail lines per area for high-income countries can improve rates. In addition, it was found that for low-income countries specifically, improvements in basic and health infrastructure (as measured through spending on healthcare, number of doctors and hospital beds per 100k, population percent with access to electricity, life expectancy, and vehicles per 1000 people) improved vaccination rates. Interestingly, of the high-income countries, those with larger 65+ populations struggled to vaccinate at higher rates, indicating accessibility issues for the elderly. The insights from this study conclude that improvements in basic and health infrastructure, a focus on accessibility in the last mile, and global partnerships can improve logistical operations of such a scale. Structural impediments and inequities in global health care must be addressed in preparation for future global public health crises.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/11/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Hani&nbsp;S&nbsp;Mahmassani</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2114778/2114778_10713909_1683796927117_DASHBOARDOBJECTIVES--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2114778/2114778_10713909_1683796927117_DASHBOARDOBJECTIVES--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Vaccine Logistics Dashboard Objectives\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2114778/2114778_10713909_1683796927117_DASHBOARDOBJECTIVES--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Vaccine Logistics Dashboard Objectives\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Objectives of vaccine logistics dashboard developed in this project.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NUTC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Hani&nbsp;S&nbsp;Mahmassani</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Vaccine Logistics Dashboard Objectives</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2114778/2114778_10713909_1683797100293_Dashboardscreen--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2114778/2114778_10713909_1683797100293_Dashboardscreen--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dashboard screenshot\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2114778/2114778_10713909_1683797100293_Dashboardscreen--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dashboard screenshot\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screenshot of dashboard developed under this study.
