 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both within the U.S. and throughout the rest of the world, people often lack access to a safe, reliable supply of publicly provided drinking water. In the U.S., this may result from natural disasters or temporary failures in infrastructure, such as Hurricane Mar\u00eda in Puerto Rico in 2017 or the Texas power crisis in 2021, both which deprived U.S. citizens from access to safe water for days, weeks, or months. In many other parts of the world, lack of access to safe water may be a regular part of life.  In such contexts, people may be forced to periodically gather non-potable water, to treat it themselves to improve its quality and safety, and then to store the treated water within their homes. However, an important challenge is that it is not clear what practices should be employed for treating and storing water to minimize health risks. For instance, in Madagascar, water is commonly acquired from decentralized sources and then treated at the point of use (e.g., the household) to improve its safety. In this project, cohorts of U.S. students from the University of South Florida (USF) will travel to Toamasina, Madagascar, to conduct research in support of providing safe water via point-of-use treatment and sound storage practices. The project is motivated by three sets of overlapping and complementary driving objectives: (1) to advance disciplinary knowledge in the convergent fields of environmental engineering and social/behavioral sciences (social psychology/social marketing); (2) to develop global skills and competencies in a cohort of U.S. students in support of a globally competitive U.S. workforce; and (3) to contribute to the provision of safe water in a water-stressed area in eastern coastal Madagascar. Although the immediate results of this project\u2019s research will most directly benefit the populace of Toamasina, those results are likely to apply to a broad array of settings (both domestic and worldwide) where point-of-use disinfection of water is deployed and where water is stored with or without point-of-use disinfection.\r\n\r\nDuring each year of this 3-year project, 5 U.S. students (four undergraduates or early graduate students, plus one PhD student or candidate) will travel to Madagascar for a period of 7 weeks during the summer. In Madagascar, students will be mentored by the President and Vice President of Ranontsika, a non-governmental organization (NGO) that that aims to improve public health by promoting access to high-quality drinking water through a social business service franchise model. USF and Ranonstika have a successful existing partnership, and we have previously collaborated on several important initiatives related to the presence of lead (Pb) in household water in Toamasina. The intellectual merit of this project derives from the completion of convergent research in the complementary disciplines of environmental engineering and social psychology (social marketing). Environmental engineering students will (a) develop methods/procedures for estimating proper chlorine dose for point-of-use disinfection of potable water in an environment with widely varying raw water quality, and (b) develop methods/procedures for controlling bacterial re-contamination in household water storage containers (with particular emphasis on households not practicing point-of-use disinfection).  Simultaneously, social/behavioral sciences students will use social marketing to understand the local community\u2019s knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors related to point-of-use disinfection and household storage, including the importance the community places on specific products and techniques, where they seek information, and when/how/why they employ particular practices. Results from these two complementary lines of research will be combined to develop a strategy that encourages or modifies behaviors to maximize water safety. Broader impacts of this project will include the development of global competencies and skills within the cohort of students who conduct research in an international setting. In this project, by partnering with an NGO that is based on a unique business model, students will observe alternative models for successful enterprises in low-income countries.  The work proposed here will strengthen an existing partnership between USF and Ranontsika, and will expand our collaborative research portfolio by investigating disinfection and microbiological quality of water as well as Pb contamination of household water.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

&nbsp; &nbsp;Our student team collected samples of source water and stored household water from Toamasina households that use different water sources and different storage strategies, and analyzed the samples for several fecal indicator bacteria. &nbsp;Concentrations of total coliforms in stored household water were significantly higher than in the corresponding source water (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05). &nbsp;In households that store their water in 20-L polyethylene jerrycans, biofilms on the walls of the jerrycan ubiquitously harbored total coliforms and Enterococcus; these biofilms are a likely source of bacterial regrowth or recontamination in the stored water.&nbsp; To protect against such recontamination, we found that cleaning jerrycans with a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite, known locally as Sur'Eau or Manadio Rano, was effective at reducing the concentrations of bacteria that slough from the jerrycan biofilms.&nbsp; However, surprisingly, weekly cleaning of the jerrycans with Sur'Eau did not offer a significant advantage over less-frequent cleanings in terms of the quality of the stored water.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We learned that community members do not readily accept POU chlorination with Sur'Eau, for a variety of reasons, including taste, smell, and cost. &nbsp;Despite lack of acceptance of POU chlorination, there was interest among the population in improving water quality and health outcomes for their households and community.&nbsp; We developed a jerrycan cleaning protocol, including four key steps and use of Sur'Eau as a cleaning agent, and we developed an infographic in both English and Malagasy.&nbsp; The protocol and infographic were shared with households at the end of Year 2.&nbsp; Community members initially expressed overwhelming support for the protocol, including use of Sur'Eau to clean jerrycans.&nbsp; One year later, some, but not all, households were still using the cleaning protocol.&nbsp; Barriers to continued use include the cost of Sur'Eau, the cost of publicly sourced water, and the physical difficulty in shaking a jerrycan vigorously for 45 seconds.&nbsp; It might therefore be necessary to refine and consider alternative methods for cleaning storage containers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;

Furthermore, this project enhanced the global competencies of the participating students, as evaluated by pre-departure and post-return administration of the Global Perspective Inventory to the 2023 and 2024 students.&nbsp;
