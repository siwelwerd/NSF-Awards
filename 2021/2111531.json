 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-energy gamma-radiation represents one of the key messengers of the extreme universe, in particular providing insight into the cosmic ray accelerators that produce the highest energy particles observed.  The award supports the activities of researchers at the University of Utah for on-going participation in observations and analysis of data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) and VERITAS observatories, and the future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory. Students and postdoctoral researchers supported by this grant will explore the origin of the high-energy gamma-radiation emitted by black holes, neutron stars, and supernova remnants. In addition, the researchers will develop ultra-high-resolution visible-light observations to accurately measure the diameters and create images of nearby stars using the VERITAS Stellar Intensity Interferometry Observatory. The award supports an extensive training program for undergraduate students who do not otherwise have access to extensive research facilities, and activities that explore the connections between astronomical dark skies, urban planning, biodiversity and microclimate, workforce diversity, and economic opportunity through the University\u2019s Consortium for Dark Sky Studies.\r\n\r\nRecent advances in multi-wavelength analyses developed by the researchers provide a framework to explore possible astrophysical origins of galactic cosmic rays and the observed local positron flux.  This includes studies of archival and new VERITAS observations of promising TeV halo regions identified from current all-sky catalogs published by the Fermi satellite Observatory, and the HAWC northern-sky surveys. Next steps will realize improved gamma-ray observations with the newly-developed wide-field of view Schwartzchild-Couder Telescope and result in integrating these elements, the Multi-Messenger Maximum Likelihood analysis framework (3ML), and Matched Run Method analysis tools to the GammaPy analysis framework, for use by the future CTA observatory. Completing the program is a survey of stellar diameters measured in the U/V optical bands via intensity interferometry observations with the VERITAS telescopes that will permit development of a suite of analysis tools for imaging of O/B/A stars, Cepheid variables, and binary systems.  This project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
