 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has not just caused catastrophic disruptions at the socio-economic levels but also adversely impacted international collaboration through a complete disruption in travel, face-to-face interactions, lab work, fieldwork, and hiring. Understanding how this pandemic impacted international collaboration is essential to inform program interventions and foster a more connected and resilient global research community. This study will collect time sensitive information from domestic and international researchers to understand major issues that may have disrupted their research activities, changes they explored to address these issues, and their perception on potential opportunities to facilitate international partnerships in such adverse conditions. This data is essential to inform current and future research programs to include international collaboration components that strengthen the resilience, robustness, and sustainability of international collaborations. By facilitating international research, this study will ensure continued access to expertise, research sites, facilities and equipment for researchers to maintain shared scientific progress to boost the U.S. national economy, prosperity, and human health and well-being. Due to facility shut-downs, safety issues and prescribed non-pharmaceutical interventions, hundreds of students, mostly from underrepresented minority groups are deprived of education and training opportunities embedded in international research. By enabling robust and resilient global partnerships, this study will benefit and influence a broader U.S. student population including underrepresented minority students. The collected data will also explain if existing technology infrastructure needs significant upgrades to strengthen international research collaborations.\r\nThis study will focus on three collaboration components: team dynamics, project logistics and research operations that govern the success of international research. In a one-year rapid response effort, we will conduct a series of virtual structured interviews and online surveys of at least 90 active projects involving global collaboration, identify and evaluate key issues and changes/interventions, and create a summary matrix of gaps mapped to opportunities. The main goal is to particularly explore the aspects of international collaboration that are integral to its robustness, resilience, and sustainability. We will target international collaboration projects funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as well as other federal agencies and multi-country annexes of global agencies such as the International Energy Agency (IEA). The results will offer critical data to explain how such conditions may have impacted these components, revealing key gaps and opportunities to provide directions for making current as well as future international research programs more robust, resilient and sustainable. It will also explain the changes made by the project teams and their effectiveness to address these issues created by the pandemic. The data analysis will further explain: (1) whether and to what extent the type of project, geographic location and demographic attributes of project teams moderated the impact on the robustness, resilience, and sustainability aspects of the project; (2) if certain mechanisms inherent in research programs or solicitations helped or worsened these aspects; and (3) whether certain project activities were more conflicting or challenging than the others. The first-hand data and answers to these questions will form a knowledge base for further research and help identify the areas of improvement in international research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In general, constrained travel and facilities shutdown had major impact on projects. The results indicate that the pandemic affected the robustness of the international research collaboration considerably. Generally, the impact of COVID-19 on the robustness indicators was either major or moderate. The pandemic affected 2 of the 6 indicators (~33%) greatly. The impact of the challenges, conflicts, and limitations on project logistics was more severe than that on the other research components. The impact of challenges on the research process and outcomes was moderate. More than half of the participants mentioned that the pandemic caused their research to slow down but continue. Surprisingly, among positive, unclear, and negative effects of COVID-19 on project outcomes, the highest percentage belonged to the positive effect. Project teams could utilize the spare time for publications and virtual presentations to disseminate results. Focusing on how to meet project logistics and face travel restrictions and facilities shutdown during pandemic can increase the robustness of international research.</p>\n<p>In terms of resilience of international collaboration, most participants mentioned that their teams had already explored some changes/interventions to remain resilient. These include virtual platforms for meetings/workshops/conferences/training, conducting computational rather than physical experiments, working on the collected data and publications, developing software modules to support remote testing, using different device/method/workforce/sites to collect data, changing study methodology, virtual mentoring, reducing the number of students, working remotely, changing sampling scheme, reducing the length of the program, working more on the conceptual approach of the project, complying with guidelines to contain COVID-19 spread, rescheduling activities, team reorganization, focusing on brainstorming sessions, outlining and writing review papers, replacing field trips with online interviews, changing potential participants, changing the sequence of tasks, changing the research scope, reducing project staff, modifying protocols, using simulations, etc. Among all, using virtual platform was the most frequently mentioned change/intervention. More than half of the participants considered the impact of these changes/interventions on their research quality as positive. In general, the pandemic affected the indicators of resilience moderately. The results indicate that most interventions explored can help enhance resilience to pandemic situations.</p>\n<p>Regarding sustainability, the most profound impact was on the schedule of the projects, which caused the project duration to increase. However, its impacts on the project budget and health and safety of team members were moderate. Among different impacts of the pandemic on the project budget (positive, unclear, and negative), the highest percentage belonged to the negative impact. Regarding the pandemic impact on health/safety, the highest percentage belonged to mental health issues.<strong> </strong>Participants also mentioned numerous opportunities that can help make international collaboration more sustainable in adverse conditions. These include robotic and remote data collection; infrastructure to support internet connectivity and virtual platforms to increase online/remote working as much as possible; access to virtual platforms to low/middle-income countries; tools to allow people from different countries to simultaneously work on the same project; artificial intelligence (AI) for facilitating research/data collection; sharing research resources to facilitate research during pandemics; training local communities to help in data collection during pandemics; supplemental funding for training and community engagement; increased remote access to labs to students; flexible project planning with contingency plan; pandemic restrictions and guidelines adjusted to help support research during uncertain and adverse conditions; developing regional molecular laboratories to produce data; training research teams to be more flexible; prioritizing global accessibility of vaccinations; and increased student exchange.</p>\n<p>Demographic attributes of project teams such as age, gender, number of students involved in the project, and the percentage of project completion did not moderate the impact of pandemic on the robustness, resilience, and sustainability of the studied projects. Discipline, geographic location, and research type seem to moderate impact on project logistics (resilience), project operation (robustness), and research operation (robustness), respectively. Even though virtual platforms were available, programs requiring fieldwork, lab work, and context-based data collection faced more serious issues.Certain activities such as conducting experiments, equipment provision/maintenance/cost, data collection (quantity and quality of data, speed/ease/cost of data collection, and sample shipment), hiring post-docs/Ph.D. students, following new regulations for different project activities, communication, and training were more conflicting than the others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/05/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Manish&nbsp;Dixit</p>\n</div>\n<div
