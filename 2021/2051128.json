 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Kansas, located in Lawrence, KS, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2022-2024.  Students will formulate their research plans with their mentors, spend the majority of their time on a research project, and will present their findings in a university-wide Research Symposium at the end of summer.  The underlying aim is to provide students with a strong basis and incentive for pursuing careers in research, with a specific goal of increasing diversity and participation in the sciences. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, or from underrepresented groups, will be trained in the program.  \r\n\r\nMentor-directed scientific activities will be performed in the Department of Molecular Biosciences in faculty labs in the fields of biochemistry, cell, molecular and developmental biology, virology and microbiology, and computational biology.  In the context of the common research theme of \u201cStress,\u201d students will learn how environmental and biological conditions may affect development, function, and survival of cells and organisms, as well as the nature of stress response mechanisms.  Examples of student projects may involve use of genetically tractable organisms (Drosophila, C. elegans) to model evolution of stress responses or neurological responses to stress, use of modified infectious agents (bacteria, coronavirus) in studies of host/pathogen interactions and mechanisms, and biochemical analysis of infection-associated strategies in microorganisms (T3SS, quorum sensing).  Weekly programs and social activities will develop student career progression, foster independence as a scientist, hone presentation skills, and foster community.  Students will attend interactive workshops on responsible conduct of research, scientific writing, and applying to graduate school.  Assessments of the program will be performed using the SALG URSSA tool.  Program members and faculty will maintain continued communications with participants as they plan for conference presentations and prepare for graduate school, allowing their career trajectories to be assessed. Participants should have completed freshman biology and chemistry, and must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents.  More information about the program is available at mbreu.ku.edu, or by contacting the PI, Dr. Lisa Timmons, at mb-reu@ku.edu.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Over the 3-year award period, from 2022 to 2024, 33 undergraduate students were engaged in full-time research aimed at understanding how cells cope with environmental, metabolic, pathogenic and genomic stresses. These experiences were designed to provide a platform for scientific inquiry while fostering a deeper interest in STEM careers, particularly in cellular biology, molecular biology, microbiology, and biochemistry.\r\n\n\n\nIn the early 1980s, the NSF recognized a need to strengthen the U.S. STEM workforce. Before the establishment of the REU program, undergraduates had limited opportunities to participate in research at a national level, as opportunities were primarily geared toward graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The NSFs goals are to inspire more students, particularly those from institutions without strong research programs, to pursue advanced degrees in STEM fields. REU programs achieve this by exposing undergraduate students to the excitement of scientific discovery and the research process, thereby addressing concerns about the U.S.'s global leadership in science and technology.\r\n\n\n\nIn our REU program, workforce skills were developed in several contexts. The students participated in research activities guided by lab mentors, and program activities were designed to improve their ability to develop hypotheses, design appropriate experimental controls, and learn troubleshooting skills. Their analysis skills were further developed through statistics and R programming workshops. Science communication and professional skills were developed through group-based discussions of hypotheses being tested, elevator pitches, discussions of professional and scientific integrity, and while preparing scientific posters for our end-of-summer undergraduate research symposium. Pathways to graduate school and future employment in science were emphasized through workshops on the graduate school application process, panel discussions on graduate school selection and success, tours of local industries, and panel discussions with junior and senior scientists or program directors of post-baccalaureate programs.
