 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a well-documented lack of diversity in the geoscience classroom, faculty and geoscience professional ranks and environmental workforce. This workshop introduces a diverse population of high school and undergraduate participants to solution based geoscience and potential career pathways. The workshop will help increase the diversity in the educational and career pipeline of future geoscience professionals and show participants ways to become active in addressing the impact of public facilities on their communities. Working with practicing geoscientists and educators, participants will develop and present on cutting edge environmental infrastructure (water, power, sewer, solid waste, etc.) issues, technologies and careers which affect their daily lives. They will learn the skill sets necessary to become more active participants and problem solvers who are focused on using geoscience to aredress the impact of public facilities on their communities.\r\n\r\nThis workshop has the potential to increase participants\u2019 awareness of environmental infrastructure and the connection to community impacts and STEM-related careers. The proposed workshop squarely addresses AGU\u2019s Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan including to 1) \u201cPromote and expand collaborative activities... with local community\u2013relevant scientific endeavors, particularly in support of under-served and disadvantaged communities\u201d and 2) \u201cIncrease the visibility of education and career paths (in earth science) among diverse audiences and encourage participation in the geosciences.\u201d Program participants will develop creative content for presentation at the 2020 AGU Virtual Fall Meeting - including virtual tours, videos, and interactive communication pieces to demonstrate how New Orleans', San Francisco\u2019s and Los Angeles' unique geology and seaport locations impact the critical infrastructure of those cities and respective communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project provides a way for professional societies to work with local community organizations and increase diversity within the workforce pool.  As a result of this project, Arizona State University (ASU) was awarded a much larger grant from the NSF to continue to develop this type of programming.
