 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the integration of hands-on and computer-based learning to teach the relationship of mathematics to physical constructions. The learning experience is designed for desktop and tablet computers as well as augmented reality headsets. This project is founded on the idea that creativity can open the door to understanding the relationship between one\u2019s imagination and skills that are taught in the classroom. Mastering the abstract concepts of middle-school math is critical. The proposed system maps creative ideas to abstract mathematical concepts, supporting the ability to transfer knowledge of mathematical concepts to real-world situation, and adaptable to the entire K-16 education space. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project will support the research and development of a learning platform consisting of Internet-of-Things hardware devices, a construction knowledge engine and learning module applications. The project uses both declarative and procedural learning by merging the physical, virtual, and computational worlds for creative problem-solving, and spatial thinking and fine motor dexterity skills development using a building, sense-making, and synthesis learning framework. This system consists of connectable blocks that render a virtual model to be analyzed for mathematical and structural features. The project will design a prototype through the tasks of development of the pilot middle school mathematics curriculum, creation of technical designs for manufacturing, and validation for deployment at scale.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
