 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Christina Cooley of Trinity University is studying fluorogenic polymers that are prepared from non-fluorescent, \"dark\" monomers.  The incorporation of multiple dark monomers into a long polymer chain \"turns-on\" visible fluorescence emission with increasing brightness as the polymer chain grows. This research aims to identify new monomers to develop synthetic strategies for preparing fluorogenic polymers in open-air and aqueous solution, and to reveal fundamental principles that govern polymerization kinetics and fluorescence properties. The Cooley group will also explore the use of fluorogenic polymerization in signal amplification platforms for the sensitive detection of biomolecules and their interactions. Signal-amplified sensing platforms are potentially useful in a range of applications including medical diagnosis of biomarkers. Undergraduate students engaging in this research will receive broad, interdisciplinary hands-on training in preparation for future careers in science. A new undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory course will be developed that integrates concepts and problem-solving with hands-on scientific training. The PI is also establishing a STEM outreach program to local elementary schools led by female undergraduates to foster retention and diversity in STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThe Cooley group will identify monomers for the synthesis of fluorogenic polymers in aqueous solution by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) using the activators regenerated by electron transfer (ARGET-ATRP) method. Synthetic approaches will be developed to enable fluorogenic polymerization by reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) in the open air. To allow exquisite control of polymer length and to correlate the observed fluorescence with initiator concentration, this research aims to reveal the fundamental principles that govern polymerization kinetics and fluorescence properties of these fluorogenic polymers. This fundamental knowledge will inform the design of a sensitive, signal amplification platform for qualitative and quantitative detection of analytes and receptor-ligand binding interactions.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
