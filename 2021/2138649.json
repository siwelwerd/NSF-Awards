 "awd_abstract_narration": "Study of the genomic basis and evolution of physiological adaptations can provide valuable insight on the impacts of climate change on Arctic species. This research focuses on the polar bear, an iconic symbol of climate change, and its adaptation to high-latitude environments. Multiple types of genome data from closely related bear species will be used to identify regions of the polar bear genome that underlie specific physiological adaptations. This information will improve understanding of current and future impacts of climate change on these animals. To broaden participation and diversity in Arctic science, the fellow will conduct public outreach, organize workshops, and mentor students from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nWhile brown and black bears undergo annual hibernation in response to seasonal prey scarcity, the ability to hibernate has been greatly reduced, and nearly lost altogether, in the adaptation of polar bears to the Arctic. Given the complexity of the hibernation phenotype and the short divergence time between polar bears and hibernating bear lineages, evolution of regulatory sequences may have played a particularly important role in evolution. Through the integration of functional and population genomics datasets, this project will characterize the landscape of protein coding and regulatory evolution in three bear lineages and test the hypothesis that regulatory evolution facilitated the rapid adaptation of the polar bear lineage to Arctic environments. This work will advance understanding of the mechanisms and complexity of polar bear adaptations, the processes by which polar bears adapted to Arctic environments, and the vulnerability of this apex predator to climate change. The project will also provide insights into vertebrate genomics and evolution, broadening our understanding of the processes by which complex physiological traits arise and evolve in vertebrates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Hibernation is a complex physiological adaptation to seasonal reductions in resource availability that involves reductions in metabolic rate and body temperature, inactivity, temporary onset of insulin resistance, and other metabolic shifts. Hibernation is driven in part by seasonal changes in the activity of thousands of genes in important metabolic tissues such as adipose. Prior work has shown that hibernation is achieved in part through non-canonical activity of common vertebrate signaling networks, such as the insulin signaling and AMPK pathways, suggesting that hibernating species have modified otherwise conserved regulatory pathways to achieve unique outcomes. Within bears, hibernation capacity is variable across species such that some species, including brown and black bears, hibernate for a significant portion of the year, while other species with more seasonally consistent resource availability are incapable of hibernation. Of particular interest is the polar bear, which is closely related to brown bears (estimated divergence time of 500,000 years) yet has rapidly experienced the loss or significant reduction of hibernation during adaptation to a novel arctic environment. This system provides a valuable opportunity to understand how complex physiological adaptations such as hibernation can be rapidly modified in relatively short evolutionary timescales. Our research specifically focused on identifying gene regulatory sequences (i.e., enhancers) that control key gene activity shifts in hibernating species, and using these to test the hypothesis that the evolutionary modification of regulatory sequences (and thus changes in the activity of the genes that they control) have played a significant role in the loss of hibernation capacity and general metabolic specialization in polar bears. Overall, our results demonstrate that enhancer sequences are highly conserved across bear species, consistent with their roles in regulating important metabolism genes and pathways, but that a subset of enhancers have experienced rapid sequence evolution in specific bear lineages and thus likely underly species-specific changes in metabolism and hibernation physiology. In the polar bear specifically, genes targeted by rapidly evolving enhancers are enriched for involvement in glucose and lipid metabolism, the regulation of insulin sensitivity, and other pathways known to play important roles in hibernation in other bear lineages. These findings suggest that while the majority of enhancers have remained conserved between brown bears and polar bears, evolutionary modification of a small number of regulatory sequences have contributed to physiological adaptation to the arctic environment by modifying the activity of important metabolism genes and pathways.
