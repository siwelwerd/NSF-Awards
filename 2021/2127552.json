 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is to advance a new women's health device to address stress urinary incontinence (SUI).  The estimated lifetime risk of urinary incontinence surgery in women is 20% by age 80, with 41.3 million women estimated to suffer from urinary incontinence by 2050.  The associated market had an estimated value of $1.6 billion in 2018, with projections to reach $2.3 billion by 2026.  The proposed device addresses this need and improves clinical outcomes. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate the mechanical feasibility of a non-mesh surgical device by developing the first viable prototype and iterating elements of the device design based on mechanical tests (strength, stiffness, and durability) of each of the device\u2019s components (i.e., the elastic band, the tissue anchor, and the bone anchor) and the device as a whole. The technical objectives include using computational simulations to assess the material stiffness and optimize placement, preparing and testing materials, and ensuring strength and longevity of the assembled device.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
