 "awd_abstract_narration": "When matter falls into supermassive black holes, it forms a disk of material. Jets of matter streaming away from the disk can be produced in the extreme environment of a black hole. These jets are promising sources of high energy cosmic rays and neutrinos that can be detected on Earth. This project will produce computer models of the acceleration of particles in these jets. The project will combine two techniques to provide a better understanding of how and where cosmic rays and neutrinos are produced in jets. The techniques can also be applied to other sources of cosmic rays, such as gamma ray bursts and pulsars. The project will also develop an interactive website that introduces the latest developments of the research. This website will be combined with day-long workshops to make the material accessible to high-school students. A program will also be developed to bring astrophysics discussions to soup kitchens in the New York City area. This award advances the goals of the Windows on the Universe Big Idea.\r\n\r\nModeling of the acceleration of particles in astrophysical jets will be done with relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and particle-in-cell codes that can tie small scale non-thermal processes with larger scale fluid models. The approach used will allow for the development of mid-scale studies linking the regimes of the two different codes. Models of radiative processes will then be applied to the output of the mid-scale models to produce reliable radiative signatures expected from different regions and processes within the jets. The approach used in this work can be also applied to gamma ray bursts, double neutron star mergers, and pulsar wind nebulae. The project will also provide research opportunities for undergraduate students. The project will develop an interactive website called \"Astrophysics Lab on Cosmic Rays\" which can be used in both undergraduate and high-school settings. Use of the materials in the high-schools will be assisted by day-long worktops for educators and students. The project will also implement a program called \"Astro-soup\", where serving food to the homeless in NYC will be accompanied by a more structured discussion on astrophysical topics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
