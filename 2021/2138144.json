 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maria Wimberly is awarded a Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and education at the University of California, Riverside. She plans a study of near\u2013field cosmology and numerical modeling of galactic star formation.  She has extensive experience with hydrodynamic simulations that include star formation models. These models yield different predictions of heavy element production in ultra\u2013faint dwarf galaxies, which depend on the environment where the stars formed. She will improve the Cal\u2013Bridge Scholarship\u2019s peer mentorship program, to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in Physics & Astronomy by strengthening genuine camaraderie.  The program includes specific personalized professional development planning for these young, diverse scientists. \r\n\r\nWimberley will compare models of predicted element abundances to observations of galaxies in different environments, to determine which physical processes are most important in these environments. A key question she seeks to answer is what fraction of the Milky Way\u2019s ultra\u2013faint dwarf galaxies were never satellites of other smaller galaxy systems, prior to entering the Milky Way\u2019s system. She seeks to learn what fraction of the Milky Way\u2019s satellite galaxies are true, pristine relics of the first galaxies ever formed.  These galaxies are optimal sites to search for signatures of the first stars ever formed.  Within the expanded Cal-Bridge program, she plans a vertical mentoring structure.  These peer mentorship activities provide space for students to create a community around equity through normalizing common struggles, individual holistic success, and determining how to improve their academic experience. This type of group work/mentoring organically creates leadership opportunities and a thriving community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
