 "awd_abstract_narration": "Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), located in Palisades, NY will host a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program. The title of the program is \u201cInterdisciplinary Cutting-Edge Research through the Analysis of Global Data\", and it will provide ten-week research internship opportunities for fourteen undergraduates each summer from 2021-2023. \r\n\r\nThe program takes students from posing a cutting-edge scientific question, to gathering and analyzing data, developing conceptual hypotheses, and culminates in activities that communicate their results to scientific and broader audiences. Students work with LDEO\u2019s interdisciplinary research community and are individually mentored by at least one of LDEO\u2019s 180 PhD-level scientists. The global data theme focuses the experience on data-driven, solutions-oriented approaches to scientific questions. A lecture series on forefront research and workshops in professional ethics, data display and manipulation, scientific writing, and career opportunities add depth to the experience. The program includes a formal outcome-based evaluation by an educational professional, together with a midterm review of students and mentors. Students will be housed in dormitories at the nearby Dominican College and/or participate virtually. The program is co-funded by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the  Division of Earth Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

LDEO REU Site Jointly Funded by NSF Ocean and Earth Sciences\n\n\n The LDEO REU Site has a long history of inclusion and improvement over time, especially during the last three years of this award. The number of students from groups under-represented in the Earth and Ocean Sciences has steadily climbed, as has the number of first generation college students. We have also had a large increase in the number of students from small schools (mostly community colleges) with no research opportunities in the Earth and/or Ocean Sciences (Figure 1).\n\n\n The success of the program is also exemplified by the numbers of students who obtain bachelors degrees in Earth and Ocean Sciences and ultimately PhDs in science (Figure 2). Both women and members of under-represented groups have obtained PhDs at rates equal to those of men.\n\n\n During the last three years, forty four percent of our interns have come from groups under-represented in the Earth and Ocean Sciences. If one includes Asians, who are under-represented in Earth Science and parts of Ocean Science, fifty six percent of our interns have come from groups under-represented in Earth and Ocean Science.

This is a big increase from prior to 2016, when at most one or two REU funded interns per year were first generation college students. Finally, we are attracting interns from small schools where opportunities to conduct research are limited or non-existent, primarily students from community or tribal colleges. During the past three years, fifty one percent of our REU funded interns have come from small schools. The PIs have also gained experience and improved their knowledge, during the life of the award, on how to engage with students from small schools to increase the number of applications to the LDEO program.
