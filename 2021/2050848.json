 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York will host a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program called Aquatic Science, Engineering, and Technology (ASET). The program will bring eight undergraduates to Clarkson each summer for a ten-week research experience during the summers of 2021-2022.  \r\n\r\nASET will focus on the Great Lakes and Hudson River basin environmental research. REU interns will have opportunities to conduct research in a range of disciplines with a focus on 1) Aquatic Natural Sciences, 2) Aquatic Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences and 3) Aquatic Resource Engineering. Projects available to students will develop skills in ecosystem ecology, population genetics, molecular taxonomy, molecular toxicology, computational biology, wildlife monitoring and GIS analysis, aquatic biogeochemistry and limnology, sustainable forestry, aquatic engineering, mitigating nitrates in wastewater, environmental chemistry, etc. The program includes an integrative learning community through research, seminars, professional development, and social activities. Student recruitment will develop cohorts that are diverse in perspective, discipline, and demographics. Objectives are to 1) develop a student\u2019s research experience; 2) develop a diverse and supportive learning community; 3) strengthen Scholars\u2019 skills to create and evaluate communication products; 4) foster Scholars\u2019 evaluation of the ethical and legal aspects in research; 5) validate the Scholars' academic path and facilitate degree completion in a STEM-related field; and 6) encourage Scholars to choose a career in STEM, especially in aquatics. This award is supported by the Directorate of Biological Sciences and the Division of Ocean Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
