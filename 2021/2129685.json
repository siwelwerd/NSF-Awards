 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Polar Geospatial Center (PGC) is a polar science and logistics support organization at the University of Minnesota. By distributing and using high-resolution optical imagery made available by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to U.S. Government-funded researchers, PGC is able to solve various geospatial problems for scientists to study both the Arctic and Antarctic with mapping and remote sensing projects. This helps to support the National Science Foundation's mission to understand the Earth and its global and regional system by facilitating innovative new techniques and products - such as Digital Elevation Models for both polar regions, mapping seasonal changes of sea ice coverage and dynamics of continental ice sheets (e.g., ice loss due to global climate change and quantification of meltwater on the ice sheet surface in Greenland and Antarctica), preparing detailed topography maps for polar atmospheric and ocean studies, glaciology, geology, geophysics, and permafrost changes, identifying actual coastlines masked by ice or meltwater and impacts of extreme weather events, watching polar flora seasonal changes and climate-driven ecosystem shifts, and even counting vertebrate (e.g., polar bears, penguins, etc.) populations. \r\n\r\nThe PGC facilitates scientists' access to geospatial resources and respective domain knowledge by providing the following products and services to the NSF polar community: (1) Access to billions of square kilometers of repeat-coverage commercial satellite imagery licensed from multiple companies by U.S. Government agencies for the Antarctic and Arctic; (2) The PGC's specific institutional knowledge to solve a broad range of geospatial, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence problems; and (3) Geospatial educational courses and online materials to translate the PGC\u2019s expertise and experience to the NSF polar science community and encourage diverse graduate and undergraduate students to participate in the polar remote sensing and geospatial science. PGC educates the next generation of scientists with the use and manipulation of geospatial products through online educational materials, accessible documentation, and student employment and mentorship. PGC will work to broaden participation in polar (and) geospatial science through partnership with minority-serving institutions. PGC is also a source of public geospatial data that empowers researchers, educators, and others from outside the NSF polar community to investigate the limits of the current understanding of Earth surface processes. PGC\u2019s partnership with industry (Google, ESRI) and other government agencies (NASA, NGA) further enhance availability and accessibility of geospatial data via these partners\u2019 platforms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
