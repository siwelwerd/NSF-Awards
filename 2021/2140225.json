 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oil and water don't mix and exist as two separate phases of matter. Phase separation of soft matter mixtures such as lipids, oil and water can be exploited to create lipid coated droplets or soft particles. Two soft particles can self-assemble with a lipid bilayer connecting the two soft particles. The soft particle composition can also include more complex matter such as polymers. When a biological ion channel is incorporated into one of the soft particles, it self-assembles into the lipid bilayer forming a communication channel, where, for example, water and ions can be exchanged between the soft particles, and the exchange can be modulated by an external stimulus such as an electric field, mechanical force, pH, etc. In addition to creating a platform for exchange of contents between the two soft particles, the external stimulus can also induce mechanical deformations in the soft particles. Self-assembled soft particles can enable sensing of external stimuli, creation of synthetic cell-like structures, compartmentalized reactions and other important functions. In spite of tremendous technological impact of self-assembled soft particles, the mechanics of the self-assembly process, complex deformations of soft particles under various stimuli, and the functionality of ion channels beyond what is already known in biology are not clear. This project will train next generation scientists to develop fundamental insights into mechanics of stimuli-responsive soft materials. This award will also support inclusion of undergraduate students in research and education, engagement of women and minority students, and outreach to K-12 students.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to understand the mechanics of self-assembly and functionality of stimuli-responsive soft materials. Specifically, detailed atomistic calculations will be performed to understand the molecular mechanics of the self-assembly process, mechanical behavior of stimuli-responsive soft materials, and complex interactions between soft particles when they interact via ion channels. To understand the mechanics of larger size soft particles, coarse-grained calculations, based on the iterative Boltzmann inversion technique, will be performed. To compute macroscopic properties of stimuli-responsive soft materials, multiscale calculations integrating phenomena at various length scales will be performed. In addition to developing fundamental knowledge, various applications of stimuli-responsive soft materials will be investigated. It is anticipated that this project will not only lead to significant advances in mechanics of stimuli-responsive soft materials but also enable studies of ion channels beyond their known functionality in biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
