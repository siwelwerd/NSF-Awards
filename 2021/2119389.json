 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nUndergraduate geoscience education in the United States lags behind other Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields when it comes to racial and ethnic diversity. This deficit is particularly notable for students who come from communities that have been historically excluded in STEM fields and translates to a larger gap in the workforce and at the graduate level. Notably, there has been no improvement in the racial and ethnic diversity of students earning doctoral degrees in the geosciences over the past 40 years. Research has shown that diversity has demonstrated benefits for scientific advancement, including that diverse perspectives provide unique approaches to problem solving; these perspectives are necessary to meet the challenges and to solve the complex problems of the geosciences. To address this gap, the PIs have designed a field program: \u201cGeophysics of the Near-Surface: an Outdoor Motivational Experience for Students\u201d This project aims to inspire students to major in the geoscience and help these students develop some of the workplace skills necessary to succeed in geoscience careers. \r\n\r\nThe project will provide an engaging outdoor field experience for the student participants that will influence their choice of major, provide mentorship opportunities for upper-level undergraduates, create positive and lasting student-student and student-faculty mentor relationships, provide meaningful research experiences for the students, and create a strong cohort of students across multiple institutions.  The goals of the program are: (1) Recruit a diverse cohort of undergraduate students; (2) Support student learning in critical zone science and geophysics; (3) Increase students\u2019 science communication, problem solving, teamwork, and leadership skills; (4) Enhance psychosocial factors that are linked to retention in STEM fields; (5) Increase participation in geoscience research; (6) Increase positive attitudes towards geoscience careers and research; (7) Increase mentors\u2019 leadership and professional skills. By attaining these goals, the PIs propose to build a geoscience learning community of students across the participating institutions and within the broader scientific community and will increase recruitment and retention of these students in geoscience degrees and careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This multi-institutional initiative provided participants with hands-on training in near-surface geophysics while addressing key scientific questions in critical zone (CZ) science. The program, built on a previous NSF-GP-EXTRA grant from 2018-2021, was conducted from 2022-2024 involving collaborators from Rutgers University, Dickinson College, Penn State University, Towson University, and Johns Hopkins University.</p>\r\n<p>The GNOMES program recruited students early in their academic journeys, particularly those from two-year institutions or early undergraduates at four-year colleges, with an emphasis on engaging historically underserved groups in STEM within the US. Students participated in intensive two-week geophysical field experiences at two research sites: the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHCZO) in Pennsylvania and in the Maryland piedmont within Baltimore County. Both sites are areas with active critical zone studies and thus gave students experience conducting authentic research and engaging with site investigators. Over the three program years, GNOMES engaged 9 near-peer mentors and 39 participants from competitive application pools (&lt;40% acceptance rate). Demographics of participants were much more diverse than the demographic of undergraduate and graduate students in the geosciences at the time of the program. Survey results from the program show positive gains in psychosocial factors related to retention and in development of professional skills. A new addition to the program was supporting students to continue the research beyond the two-week field experience and synthesize their results for presentation at the AGU Fall Meeting. Guided by faculty and mentors, 28 participants across the four years gave a total of 8 presentations on their work. AGU offered additional networking and professional development opportunities for those who chose to participate.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong><br />Participants in the GNOMES program conducted research to address open questions in CZ science. Using geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity tomography, seismic refraction, and ground-penetrating radar, they collected data to map subsurface structures at multiple sites. Highlights include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Susquehanna Shale Hills Observatory</strong>: Geophysical imaging revealed variations in the distribution of sediments within solifluction lobes at Garner Run and delineated soil depth and bedrock boundaries, thus providing insights into hydrogeologic and geomorphic processes.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Maryland Piedmont</strong>: Work in Baltimore County took place at two locations: Oregon Ridge Park and Soldier&rsquo;s Delight Natural Area. These sites allow for a comparison of critical zone architecture between end-member lithologies. At Oregon Ridge, seismic data captured a deeply weathered critical zone, whereas Soldier&rsquo;s Delight indicated very little weathered thickness. These findings contribute to understanding how bedrock geology influences topography and vegetation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\r\n<p>The GNOMES program achieved significant success in recruiting diverse students to the geosciences and fostering retention through impactful educational and research experiences. The GNOMES field guide is now published and a paper on the impact on program participants is in revision. Key outcomes include:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Diverse Participation</strong>: Across all years, the program recruited cohorts that were significantly more diverse than national averages for geoscience programs.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Skill Development</strong>: Students gained proficiency in scientific research methods, data visualization, and communication. Through professional development workshops and mentorship, participants improved leadership, problem-solving, and teamwork skills.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Research Dissemination</strong>: Participants presented findings at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meetings. These experiences helped students build professional networks and explore career opportunities.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Career Impact</strong>: Surveys conducted in collaboration with the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) showed increased interest in geoscience careers and improved retention in geoscience majors. Many participants secured internships or graduate school placements.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Mentor Development</strong>: Upper-level undergraduate and graduate mentors received training in inclusive mentoring and leadership, which they applied while guiding participants. This approach fostered a supportive environment and strengthened the geoscience community.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>GNOMES has demonstrated a successful model for integrating field-based learning, research, and mentorship to enhance geoscience diversity and retention.
