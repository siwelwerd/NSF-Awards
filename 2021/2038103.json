 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participants in the geometry and topology research training group at the University of Iowa. The project seeks to build a robust vertically integrated math community, maintain the department's legacy of graduate training for people underrepresented in STEM, and expand activities to undergraduate and postdoctoral levels. The research training group faculty team will recruit and work with undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates in a vertically integrated setting. The postdocs will enhance interactions within the department and connections to the outside mathematical community. The project also aims to benefit faculty and students in other departments, regional colleges and universities, international collaborators, and the public through symposia and conferences. \r\n\r\nEach year six undergraduates and twelve graduate students will be awarded Research Training Group fellowships to boost research and competitiveness. The group will institute two summer topology courses, an undergraduate seminar, an undergraduate career workshop, and will host three conferences: Panorama of Geometry and Topology, Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium, and Topological Data Analysis. The latter will particularly help to connect participants with applied disciplines. These activities, which span all education levels and career goals, will assist postdocs in building balanced and successful careers in academia, place more graduate students in academic or research jobs, and encourage more undergraduates to enter graduate schools in mathematical sciences. The underrepresented students symposium will provide networking opportunities and promote the research performed by minority students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
