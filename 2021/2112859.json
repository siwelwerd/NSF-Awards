 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professors Katrin Becker and Ergin Sezgin at Texas A&M University.\r\n\r\nTo describe nature at the fundamental level, physicists use two different theories with very different set of rules:  quantum theory and general relativity. Quantum theory is used to describe nature at very small distances (the world of atoms and elementary particles).  By contrast, general relativity is used to describe nature at very large distances (the realm of planets, stars and galaxies). The task of finding a consistent and unified set of rules that are valid at all distances, and at the same time describing all fundamental interactions, has long been a great challenge in physics. The most promising candidate to achieve this goal is called \"string theory\" since it is based on the premise that all elementary particles correspond to different vibrational modes of an incredibly small fundamental string.  In describing phenomena at low energies, string theory produces a version of Einstein's theory of gravity known as \"supergravity\".  However, as we probe shorter distances (or equivalently higher energies), string theory predicts deviations from supergravity.  One of the important challenges in string theory is to compute and understand these deviations.  As part of their research, Professors Becker and Sezgin will pursue a number of research directions that deal with this problem, many of which have profound consequences for the description of the early universe.  This project is also envisioned to have broader impact by strengthening the numerous interfaces between string theory and mathematics, and advances the national interest by promoting progress in science and seeking new physical laws that describe the uncharted workings of our universe. The PIs will also provide critical training to postdocs and students, and plan to give public lectures on their research results.\r\n\r\nMore technically, Professors Becker and Sezgin aim to construct the full space-time effective action of different superstring- and M-theory compactifications in a form displaying manifest off-shell supersymmetry with the goal of finding all orders in the slope parameter.  For higher-dimensional supergravity theories there is no (finite) off-shell formulation. As a result, writing higher derivative supersymmetric actions turns out to be very difficult. Professors Becker and Sezgin plan to reformulate higher-dimensional supergravity theories, in particular 11D supergravity, in 4D, N = 1 superspace which is one of the simplest superspaces allowing (finite) off-shell formulations. Choosing manifest supersymmetry in four space-time dimensions is, of course, motivated by phenomenology, and Professors Becker and Sezgin envision a host of phenomenological applications of their work.  They will also explore matter couplings, hidden symmetries, anomalies, and exact solutions of higher spin theories.  They will also construct the higher derivative couplings of matter-coupled supergravity, investigate its vacua, and study its duality symmetries and its embedding into string theory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
