 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Geochemical Environmental Research Group (GERG) at Texas A&M University (TAMU) requests instrumentation as well as materials for ROV compatible instrument frames. These instruments are proposed as shared-use instruments for the fleet. The first research cruise for their NSF funded project, OCE #1851378 (TAMU) and 1851365 (FSU), titled \u201cCollaborative Research: Defying Dissolution: Unraveling the Enigma of North Pacific Deep-Sea Scleractinian Reefs in Undersaturated Water\u201d was originally scheduled for September 2020 and was postponed (currently scheduled for August 2021) because delivery of critical instrumentation for the deep-sea coral lander was delayed due to COVID-19 closures by suppliers. In addition, the lack of redundancy in their instruments was noted by the UNOLS safety review panel and to remedy this concern were advised to submit this Oceanographic Instrumentation proposal for a second set of instruments to deploy. The instrument lander consists of a SAMI-pH, SAMI-CO2, and Aanderaa Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) with CTD, oxygen sensor, and data logger. The proposed Oceanographic Instrumentation includes:\r\n1)\tSAMI-pH\t$24,036\r\n2)\tSAMI-CO2\t$28,796\r\n3)\tAanderaa ADCP\t$36,726\r\n4)\tROV compatible frame \t$9,969\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$99,527\r\nBroader Impacts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Ocean acidification affects ocean ecosystems that range from the surface and coastal ocean, to continental shelf waters, to the deep-sea where calcifying deep-sea coral reef ecosystems exist near waters that are corrosive to the coral skeletons that make up the reef. In fact, the depth where chemical dissolution of coral skeletons is favored over formation, known as the saturation horizon, is becoming shallower throughout the world?s ocean due to ocean acidification. However, detecting and attributing ocean acidification impacts in the field remains a challenge in a multi-stressor ocean and further work is needed to characterize current impacts and project future changes (Doo et al. 2020). In situ, high precision carbonate chemistry measurements will be critical for characterizing and understand changing ocean conditions throughout the water column. However, high precision carbonate chemistry in situ<em> </em>instrumentation is not readily available through any existing NSF facilities, but rather is maintained by individual labs that do not often have the flexibility or funding to make instruments available to other groups. Furthermore, redundancy of these instruments is cost prohibitive for most science budgets and most ocean acidification field studies would benefit from additional instrumentation. This project funded the purchase of two deep-sea, high precision, in situ carbonate chemistry instruments (SAMI-pH and SAMI-CO<sub>2</sub>). We performed detailed laboratory, tank, ocean, and in situ tests to ensure the quality of the data collected by these instruments. We then incorporated the instruments onto a lander with an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP). The lander was deployed at a deep-sea reef site in the North Pacific to collect carbonate chemistry, current speed and direction, temperature, salinity, and oxygen data every other hour for a year to investigate the environmental conditions controlling deep-sea coral reef health. The SAMI instruments will be incorporated into a shared use facility at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) so they will be available for use by the general research community. Further, TAMU is located near the Gulf of Mexico, which has been identified as a major gap in US ocean acidification work. Recent research in the Gulf of Mexico has demonstrated chemical and biological impacts of ocean and coastal acidification. Therefore, the instruments funded by this project will collect data to provide unprecedented data on ocean acidification impacts on deep-sea coral reefs and we anticipate a strong demand for the instruments from the broader research community for work in the GoM and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/23/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kathryn&nbsp;Shamberger</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2117035/2117035_10724357_1661287237210_LandersandKM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2117035/2117035_10724357_1661287237210_LandersandKM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Instrument Landers and Ship\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2117035/2117035_10724357_1661287237210_LandersandKM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Instrument Landers and Ship\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two instrument landers, each including a SAMI-pH, SAMI-CO2, and acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP), are prepped on the dock in Honolulu before a research cruise aboard the RV Kilo Moana</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Allison Savoie</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kathryn&nbsp;Shamberger</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Instrument Landers and Ship</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
