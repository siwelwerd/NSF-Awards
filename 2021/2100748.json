 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor nanomaterials are promising electronic nanomaterials and could be used for future high-speed nanoelectronics because of their superior electrical properties. In this project, 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and molybdenum selenium (MoSe2) semiconductor thin-film nanomaterials will be grown using plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition. The 2D molybdenum disulfide and molybdenum selenium thin-film nanomaterials will be used to fabricate 2D nanomaterial-based field-effect transistors and integrated electronic devices. The device fabrication is compatible with the current standard fabrication of silicon integrated devices for computer chips and could lead to 2D nanomaterial-based computer chips with much smaller transistors. Semiconductor devices represent a multi-trillion-dollar industry. The 2D nanomaterial-based nanoelectronic devices could contribute to the rapidly growing industry of semiconductor and nano-manufacturing and are potential alternatives to silicon-based electronic devices. This project can have great impacts on US and global societies and provide many societal benefits. The primary educational goal of this program is to integrate the research objectives to enhance the educational experiences of students. Minority graduate and undergraduate students will be mentored to perform research in nanofabrication and nanotechnology in the project. The project will also offer summer research opportunities for high school students. \r\n\r\nThe research objective of this project is to grow two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and molybdenum selenium (MoSe2) semiconductor thin-film nanomaterials using remote plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) and fabricate 2D nanomaterial-based nanoelectronic devices. An innovative localized growth method will be used to grow the 2D nanomaterials with higher ordered nanolayers and nanostructures. Unlike the conventional growth of 2D nanomaterials which grow the nanomaterials on a flat and smooth surface of substrate, the innovative localized growth will use nano-patterned substrates to grow the 2D nanomaterials with higher-ordered nanolayers and nanostructures and would allow substrate materials such as hafnium oxide and zirconium oxide for the growth of the 2D nanomaterials. The 2D nanomaterials will then be used as the active channel material to fabricate 2D nanomaterial-based field-effect transistors (FETs) and integrated electronic circuits such as inverters and oscillators using cleanroom-based micro and nanofabrication techniques. The 2D molybdenum disulfide and molybdenum selenium nanomaterials are semiconductor materials with appropriate band gaps for electronic devices applications and have unique electrical properties such as ballistic quantum transport, which enable the 2D nanomaterial-based FETs to have higher current on/off ratios and to operate faster without energy dissipation. Nanoelectronic devices built on the 2D materials offer many benefits for further miniaturization beyond Moore\u2019s Law and the possibility to revolutionize future electronic technologies. This project is potentially transformative and will create a new 2D nanomaterial and device fabrication paradigm. The project will greatly benefit the research community and semiconductor industry by providing new approaches for the fabrication of 2D nanomaterials and nanoelectronic devices. The innovative localized growth method can effectively grow nanolayered 2D thin-film materials with higher-ordered nanolayers and nanostructures while remote plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition can offer new opportunities to grow 2D nanomaterials with improved electrical properties, leading to higher-performance functional 2D nanoelectronic devices.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
