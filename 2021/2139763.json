 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research and development capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover it will build and enhance partnerships among TCUP institutions, tribal nations, local industries, and university partners in developing the nation\u2019s workforce and strengthening economies. The American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) aims to organize and convene a group stakeholders focused on building a Tribal Advanced Manufacturing Network. The project aims to be a significant step in developing a national distributed manufacturing workforce involving multiple Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), coordinating curriculum development, training, and research partnerships that improve economic development on tribal nations.   \r\n\r\nThe project aims to bring together tribal economic development stakeholders, which includes TCUs, tribal economic development agencies, industry representatives in the manufacturing sector, and university engineering departments to review the state of advanced manufacturing programs at TCUs and on tribal nations, identify opportunities to develop a collective strategy that includes a common agenda, shared measurable goals, a commitment to regular communications among partners, and commitments to activities that advance the overall goals of the initiative. The project aims to establish a core set of components to drive the Tribal Advanced Manufacturing Network that will ensure mutual benefits, determine opportunities for advancement, and identify the most appropriate partnerships to grow the network. The format of the meeting will include panel presentations, interactive dialogue, and strategic planning sessions. A report and video will be produced and broadly disseminated by AIHEC to partner institutions, tribal nations, and industry partners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nTribal Colleges and Universities (TCU)s have opportunities to leapfrog their current training and curriculum into the most advanced workforce training available. Training solutions will include hybrid curriculum with online and in-person training on equipment that will be used by industry. The goal will be to stand up technology labs, curricula, and faculty that can continuously update in an agile manner to match emerging technologies. This is a long-term strategy that can build important foundations for entrepreneurs and investors attracted to developing a highly skilled workforce from underserved regions that constantly learns and keeps up with emerging technologies.\n\n\nFrom the original intent of this project, we did not host just one multi-day meeting to include all the stakeholders at a physical location. In 2021 and subsequent years, it was more efficient and inclusive to host a number of virtual events. At the stakeholder meetings a wide variety of participants from around the country from various interests. These were extremely divergent in acquiring knowledge and sharing understanding that caused everyone to learn, become open, and acknowledge indigenous culture. Two Zoom meetings were held, with the title: Tribal Resilience, Technology, and Sustainment. An impressive group of experts, leaders, and stakeholders shared their perspectives and participated in planning. The contributions provided great momentum toward the creation of the Tribal Advanced Manufacturing Network framework. We hosted two virtual events that included six tribal leaders, eight higher education faculty/experts, five manufacturing entrepreneurs, two national labs, one federal agency, and three nonprofit indigenous support agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur discussions began with describing the future of tribal communities that involve climate and economic resiliency that expanded upon what technologies should be involved? Is it possible to support these initiatives internally from tribal communities? Or, does this support come from external resources? What is already in place that could be built upon?

Finally, who should be involved in the conversation as we combine economic resilience and climate resilience with manufacturing partnerships?\n\n\n These discussions resulted in the concepts that no academic program can succeed without an economic support system available to hire graduates and provide industry guidance; there is potential to create manufacturing businesses in remote, rural areas with emerging technologies, and that there are many resources poised to assist Native Americans.\n\n\nWe began inviting stakeholder to three web meetings occurring on November 4th, December 2nd 2021 and January 6th, 2022. that included tribal leaders and faculty, national labs, federal agencies, higher education, and manufacturers. Results from these active discussions included recommendations, connections, and revelations to provide realistic actions with resources for tribal colleges and communities interested in bringing advanced manufacturing into tribal lands, or enhancing existing labs and businesses.\n\n\nBased upon the discussions and collaboration created through the Stakeholder meetings, a concept called the Indigenous Innovation Network was created. The idea resulted in Navajo Technical University submitting a Regional Innovation Engine proposal to NSF with Arizona State University as a subrecipient. This concept was awarded, NSF Engines Development Award #2302926, and can be found at https://nsf-admit.navajotech.edu/ . This Regional Innovation Engines Development Award is focused on addressing a key void in technology-based economic development: a failure to involve tribal communities in technology transfer and advanced manufacturing.
