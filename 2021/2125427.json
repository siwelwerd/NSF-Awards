 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental noise is a critical environmental pollutant defined as unwanted or harmful outdoor sound created by human activities. It is directly associated with health and work-related problems such as hearing loss and children\u2019s cognition impairment. A major goal of a smart community is to locate these noise events, monitor them, and analyze their harmful effects on the occupants of the community, preferably in real-time. Remote noise sensing has been shown to be a proper solution in this regard. However, thus far, they have been recognized as an expensive and challengingly expandable solution, especially for large communities. This project aims to develop a cost-effective, precise, and ready-to-use remote noise monitoring solution that can be applied to large communities. The solution is specifically designed to be adaptable to community responses to different noise events. This is carried out by analyzing the noise surveys of annoyance, work- and health-related issues that are collected during the course of a pilot noise monitoring project and redesigning the monitoring solution to better address the community needs. Furthermore, by identifying and analyzing the noisy sites, this project will help city planners and policy makers with their future plans for designing infrastructures such as roads and highways that are one of the major sources of noise pollution in modern societies.\r\n\r\nThis project will create novel methodologies to measure, record, and analyze the environmental noise in large scales for cities using a combined remote sensing technology. It is intended to use the suggested noise measurement sensors (Class 1 or 2 condenser microphones) by the IEC and ANSI standards to maintain the highest level of accuracy in measurement. This project also integrates surveys of socio-acoustics impacts of noise with real-time measured data to adjust the noise monitoring program to address the community needs. The results of this integration will provide a foundation for developing new noise directives, strategic noise maps, and improving the existing ones to better address the societal needs of the current and future smart and connected communities. In addition, this project will utilize computer simulations, advanced statistical and prediction models, and machine learning to post-process the measured data and analyze it in conjunction with the results of socio-acoustics surveys as a resource for adjusting the monitoring network itself in order to carry out the measurements more efficiently. Specifically, the remote monitoring will be optimized with respect to the number of sensors, location of the sensors, and their power consumption. Furthermore, this project will recognize and categorize the noise events in terms of the community\u2019s acoustic discomfort, quantify the health impacts of environmental noise on the community, and create an automatically adjusting noise monitoring system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We developed a cost-effective, precise, and ready-to-use remote noise monitoring solution that can be applied to large communities. We installed these noise monitors in the location of a K12 school, near an interstate highway, and a hospital, near a busy road, in the city of Gainesville as shown in the photos. We collected environmental noise data for about two years. We found out that for remote environmental noise monitoring to work seamlessly in the long term the most important factors are robust network and resiliency to environmental factors such as excessive heat/cold and humidity.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">We also carried out and analyzed surveys of noise annoyance among the students of a K12 school and patients and staff of a hospital to discover the work- and health-related issues of noise. The results of the noise measurement at the hospital showed that during weekdays, daytime noise levels are slightly higher compared to weekends, likely due to increased traffic on the road. However, evening and night noise levels are slightly higher on weekends compared to weekdays. It also indicated that the highest noise level took place between 2 PM to 10 PM during the weekdays while it was between 3 PM to 1 AM during the weekends.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The results of human surveys in the hospital showed that Interior noise is a lot more annoying than the noise coming from outside, especially the beeping sound of the tube station and, to a lesser degree, people talking outside their rooms in the hallway. In some cases, the sound isolation of the patient rooms (door and walls) was over-designed, making it hard for the nurses to hear the patients out. Regarding the noise heard from the hospital helicopter, patients (16%) were bothered more than the hospital staff (10%). Moreover, we found that a noticeable number of patients have reported sleep disturbance from outside noise by over 25% of them had their sleep disrupted to some degree.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">As for the school, a comparison with the hospital noise data suggested that the highway noise varies more from day to night than the city traffic noise. When conducting surveys from students, we found out that when asked to compare inside noise to outside noise, students were expressing almost equal concerns. This was likely because the school was built in the vicinity of a major highway. We concluded that in contrast to a hospital environment since students have frequent outside activities scheduled for them during the week, the outside noise becomes as important as the inside noise. Finally, we found that there was no strong correlation between the student's gender and level of education (middle vs high school) and the level of noise annoyance. It should be noted that the study had a relatively small body of participants.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/10/2024<br>\nModified by: Hassan&nbsp;Azad</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2125427/2125427_10752658_1712805895559_20230224_091426--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2125427/2125427_10752658_1712805895559_20230224_091426--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Noise device installation at the hospital environment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2125427/2125427_10752658_1712805895559_20230224_091426--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Noise device installation at the hospital environment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The noise sensor device is being installed at the traffic light pole outside Shands hospital.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hassan Azad</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Hassan&nbsp;Azad\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Noise device installation at the hospital environment</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2125427/2125427_10752658_1712806417540_20230414_124719--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2125427/2125427_10752658_1712806417540_20230414_124719--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Noise device installation at the school environment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2125427/2125427_10752658_1712806417540_20230414_124719--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Noise device installation at the school environment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The noise sensor device is installed at the school yard.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hassan Azad</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Hassan&nbsp;Azad\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Noise device installation at the school environment</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
