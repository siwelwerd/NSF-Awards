 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop completely new technology for extended-release drugs. More than half of people told to take medicine just twice daily have trouble remembering to take both doses on time, and some drugs require dosing three- or four- times daily. This NSF project aims to create a new drug delivery system capable of programmed release over days to even weeks. The first drug product will be a treatment for malaria, which affects over 300 million people each year. Children are the most vulnerable; every 30 seconds, a child dies from malaria. Current treatments require multiple pills taken four times a day for several days. The proposed research could be transformative by enabling a cost-effective treatment taken once a day or possibly just once.  The project has an enormous potential impact as the technology could create an entirely new market for drugs and drug delivery strategies impossible with current knowledge. \r\n \r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on a novel drug delivery platform with unprecedented capabilities. Current technology has limited ability to package and control the release of challenging drugs that are: labile, peptide- or nucleic acid-based, very hydrophilic, or very hydrophobic.  The microscopic ceramic microspheres invented in the USA for national defense form the core of the technology, which is now repurposed to advance the national health and welfare. They have a thin, porous shell and a large, hollow interior that can be loaded with solids, liquids, or even gasses. The microspheres can then be sealed, and the payload released over time. This project's overall goal is to develop the drug delivery platform by focusing on a predicate proof-of-concept: achieving extended, controlled release of the anti-malarial drug Artemether over one day or longer. Challenges include developing novel ways of reliably loading and sealing the microspheres with a waxy hydrophobic drug, new methods of analyzing the product, and optimizing the drug's programmed release over time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Thanks to the support from the National Science Foundation, we have made significant progress in demonstrating the commercial potential of our innovative drug delivery platform based on porous wall hollow glass microspheres.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY. These microspheres are tiny glass balloons generally ranging in size from about 10 to 100 microns in diameter, which is about 1/3 the thickness of a human hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;These microspheres are unique because of the through-wall nano-porosity of the thin outer shells, with holes on a scale of 10 to 300 nanometers wide.&nbsp;&nbsp;This unique nano-porosity extends continuously from the outside to the inside of the microspheres and provides a pathway for filling the hollow micro-balloons with a cargo of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 1 depicts a schematic representation of these unique microspheres and the nano-porosity. Figure 2 contains electron micrographs of the actual microspheres including a picture of the microsphere wall and an enlarged view of the tiny nano-porosity channels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The microspheres can be loaded with cargos including gases, liquids, or solids. Most importantly, the cargos can be sealed inside the protective cocoons and then released on demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means the microspheres are useful for many different applications across a variety of fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, this technology was initially developed for homeland security applications and is now being tailored and studied for uses in fields of Energy (hydrogen storage and next-generation batteries), Environmental Remediation (climate change amelioration through carbon dioxide sequestration), Anti-counterfeiting (new types of security inks), and Consumer Goods (functional textiles). Most recently, SpheroFill was formed to develop these unique materials for Medical and Biomedical Applications, including this award?s focus: using these porous microspheres as a versatile drug delivery platform technology.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The porous wall hollow glass microsphere technology itself has received multiple accolades since its discovery, including an ?R&amp;D 100 Award? and Top Honors at a National Nuclear Security Administration Symposium on Discovery and Innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been over two dozen technical and peer-reviewed journal publications in various fields, several book chapters, and almost a dozen patents have been issued in both the United States and other countries. SpheroFill?s founders have been awarded multiple patents focused specifically on medical and biomedical applications including one that contains some of the research of this phase I award (U.S. Patent No. 11,464,740 issued on October 11, 2022).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PROJECT RESULTS. SpheroFill?s phase I project initially focused on the goal of incorporating the anti-malaria drug artemether into our microspheres, which was successfully accomplished. The team?s efforts then quickly expanded to include other vital drugs used to treat infectious diseases, such as antibiotics and antiparasitic drugs. The goal was to not only prove feasibility but also showcase the exceptional versatility of this platform technology. As a result, SpheroFill met or exceeded all project milestones, including loading multiple drug cargos inside the microspheres, applying a protective coating to control cargo release, and demonstrating the ability to regulate drug release from hours to days. Shown in Figure 3 are examples of loaded microspheres that were purposefully broken open to reveal cargos inside, including artemether (anti-malarial), ciprofloxacin (a powerful antibiotic for bacterial infections), and ivermectin (a broad-spectrum parasiticide).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>WHAT?S NEXT? SpheroFill?s microsphere technology has the potential to revolutionize drug delivery and transform how medicines are made. For example, imagine being able to take complex medications that usually require injections as simple pills instead. We?re working towards making this a reality by developing ways to use the microspheres to protect these medications from breaking down too quickly in our bodies. Also, these tiny spheres provide a brand-new way to slowly release drugs over time, so doctors could soon give treatments requiring prolonged infusions with just a single dose making medical care more convenient, efficient, and accessible. This innovative approach is particularly true in the pediatric medical field, where SpheroFill is committed to addressing the unique challenges of administering drugs to children. SpheroFill is submitting a phase II proposal to support these goals, focused on our first beachhead drug delivery product.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/01/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: William&nbsp;D&nbsp;Hill</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2112233/2112233_10733612_1685636480077_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2112233/2112233_10733612_1685636480077_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2112233/2112233_10733612_1685636480077_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Depicts a schematic representation of these unique microspheres.
