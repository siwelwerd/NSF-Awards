 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) requests funds for oceanographic instrumentation that is needed to carry out NSF-supported scientific research. Working within the collaborative framework of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), the proposed instrumentation will be maintained by the SIO ship operations department for use by NSF-supported scientists from institutions nationwide who require these seagoing facilities. Instrumentation is requested to support the portable seismic capabilities of the Academic Research Fleet (ARF). In addition, new instrumentation is requested to support hydrographic analysis support for the Oceanographic Data Facility (ODF), a shared use support facility for Physical, Biological and Chemical oceanography. With this proposal, SIO provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic Instrumentation:\t\r\n\t\r\nPortable Seismic Air Compressors\t$1,686,195\r\nCyberinfrastructure (CI), Ship Operations and Oceanographic Technical Services\t$156,946\r\nHighly Purified Water (HPW) Systems R/V Roger Revelle and R/V Sally Ride\t$17,847\r\nNutrient Autoanalyzer\t$95,761\r\nKongsberg APOS USBL Modem Upgrade R/V Roger Revelle and R/V Sally Ride\t$13,629\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,970,378\r\nBroader Impacts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
