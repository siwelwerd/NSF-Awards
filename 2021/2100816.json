The goals of this workshop are to highlight the contributions of women and underrepresented individuals to the field of medical robotics, and to inspire the next generation of medical roboticists.  Speakers will provide a comprehensive outlook on medical robotics by covering research from bench to bedside across a wide spectrum of applications within the field of medical robotics. This workshop aligns with the overall objectives of the M3X program in that interactive sessions will center around topics including the modeling and integration of human intent and human sensorimotor capabilities into robotic controls, and the influence of robotic behavior on the mind and motor function of the human in the loop. This award will promote the progress of science through interactive panel sessions capturing the unique professional perspectives of medical robotics researchers who have chosen \"alternate career paths\" and are at different stages of their careers.  Special emphasis will be given to women and underrepresented minorities in the invited research talks.  This workshop will provide an opportunity for networking among the participants to foster collaboration and to create mentorship opportunities for students and junior researchers. Thus, the award will benefit society by supporting education and diversity in the field of medical robotics.\r\n\r\nThe Workshop on Women in Medical Robotics will bring together experts from academia, industry and clinical practice for a one-day event highlighting the contributions of women and underrepresented individuals to the \ufb01eld of medical robotics. The workshop will include research talks on topics such as: Medical and Surgical Robotics, and Human-centric Modeling for Medical Robotic Systems.  Interactive panel sessions will also discuss professional development and specific challenges faced by women and underrepresented individuals in medical robotics research.  The event will also include a student poster session highlighting research at the intersection of mind, machine, and motor systems (M3X) in the context of medical robotic systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The goal of these workshop was to highlight the contributions of women and underrepresented minorities to the fields of medical robotics and surgical training, as well as to inspire the next generation of medical roboticists through interactive panel discussions and student poster sessions along with best paper awards.</p>\n<p>Our first workshop was held in conjunction with the 2021 International Symposium on Medical Robotics on November 17th, 2021. The workshop featured 8 internationally recognized women conducting research in medical robotics and spanning both academia and industry. Speakers also represented a range of expertise levels from senior PhD students to full Professors. The full program for this workshop can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/ismrwomeninrobotics2021/home\">https://sites.google.com/view/ismrwomeninrobotics2021/home</a></p>\n<p>Important discussion&nbsp;topics for this workshop included understanding why strong academic women may choose to pursue jobs in industry v.s., academia as well as addressing some commonly held misconceptions about academic jobs, particularly as it relates to balancing family life. Students from the audience also asked panelists to address how to maintain confidence and self-esteem as many students frequently struggle with disappointments during their doctoral training (e.g., failed experiments, rejected papers, etc). The responses emphasized the prevalence&nbsp;of disappointment in academic research at all levels, but also encouraged students to take pride in their past accomplishments to stay motivated. The discussion ended by emphasizing the important roles of women and underrepresented minorities&nbsp;conducting research in industry to continue participating in, and helping organize, traditionally academic medical robotics conferences and workshops.</p>\n<p>Our second workshop was held in conjunction with the 2022&nbsp;International Symposium on Medical Robotics on April 13th, 2022. The focus of this workshop centered more on diversity in surgical training research and featured 7 speakers from industry, academia, as well as clinical practice most of whom where underrepresented minorities in their respective fields. The workshop included a panel focused on technology opportunities in surgical training featuring speakers from clinical practice and industry, as well as a later panel discussion on fostering diversity in surgical training research. Here the discussion focused on challenges as well as ideas to better support parents, particular those with younger children, across academic and industry research, as well as ways to better involved clinicians and surgeons in research and encourage more of their participation in traditionally engineering focused conferences related to medical and surgical robotics. Six students participated in the poster competition and first place was a tie, awarded to one PhD student and one undergraduate student. The full program of this conference can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/2022ismrdworkshopdiversity/home\">https://sites.google.com/view/2022ismrdworkshopdiversity/home</a></p>\n<p>The intellectual merit of these two workshops was to advance knowledge by sharing cutting edge research in medical robotics, surgical robotics, and surgical training while also broadly impacting our field by primarily highlighting the work of women and underrepresented minorities in research. Participation in engineering and academic research was broadened by including speakers from clinical practice and industry, which also served to foster a greater sense of partnership between individuals focused on the same end-goal but who may have taken alternative career paths. Finally, by including both undergraduate and graduate students in these workshops, we helped to motivate and develop a diverse and globally competitive workforce for medical robotics.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/05/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ann&nbsp;Majewicz Fey</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div
