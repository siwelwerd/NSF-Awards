 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program will offer individually mentored research experiences at the forefront of astronomical exploration to foster and enhance the careers of a diverse cohort of aspiring  professionals in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). The site will also include educators through the Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program. The Institute for Astronomy (IfA) at the University of Hawaii REU/RET program will benefit society by training a diverse demographic in research skills needed in a STEM career. They will achieve diversity by recruiting Pacific Islanders and minority students from professional organizations supporting African American, Hispanic, and Native American scientists. Participants will learn about the impact that astronomical facilities have on indigenous people and the importance of communication between scientists and the public. Progress towards achieving the desired societal outcomes will be assessed by conducting independent, external, quantifiable, surveys and interviews with the participants just before the program begins, at its mid-point, and after the program ends. Many past students reported that this program was a key factor in their decision to attend graduate school or pursue a career in STEM, and it is expected that new RET participants will multiply the program's effectiveness by bringing a modern astronomical research perspective to their classrooms.\r\n\r\nThe method is based on past experience but will now be focused on diversifying the student demographics through targeted recruitment and restricting the program to students from non-research universities and colleges. With 50 mentors pursuing a broad range of astrophysical research, the participants will be immersed in the IfA's world-class research environment. The experience will also include activities that promote professional development. Participants will visit observatories on Mauna Kea, complete research projects based on data from these facilities and participate in observations. In addition to the mentoring process, students will participate in a STEM-specific professional development course providing background and skills required for a STEM career. A set of reports in the form of a research paper serves to develop the participants' writing skills. Finally, the participants develop their presentation skills by preparing poster and oral presentations and then giving them to broad audiences. The participants are supported to present their research in poster or oral form at a professional meeting after the program ends. In the long term, the program will advance knowledge by sparking a lifelong pursuit of knowledge in a STEM career in participants who will then bring their renewed excitement to their classrooms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
