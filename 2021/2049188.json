 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The goal of this REU Site is to provide advanced materials training to the next generation of scientists and engineers while increasing participation by various underrepresented groups. Talented students are being recruited nationwide with a focus on attracting participants from local and regional historical black colleges and university (HBCU) partners and state-funded, predominately undergraduate institutions (PUI). The experience includes an intense 10-week summer program with a rigorous hands-on independent research lab experience in various aspects of advanced materials including multidisciplinary projects in chemistry, physics, mechanical engineering, and biology. In addition to research, participants get impactful training through weekly career pathway and professional development sessions, safety, ethics, and anti-harassment seminars, a 1\u20132-day industrial laboratory rotation, and a series of working lunches with professionals from academics, industry, and government laboratories. The REU Site is evaluated during and after the 10-week session with assistance from outside consultants; long-term impact on the participant vocations will be assessed during the following five years. The research and professional training provided by this program is serving to promote graduate studies and careers in advanced materials. Graduates in materials typically find employment in advanced manufacturing, medical and quantum-computing materials, oil refining, energy storage, and environmental remediation.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: This REU Site provides students with a highly focused interdisciplinary 10-week summer research experience in advanced materials. Participants are involved in a wide range of both fundamental and applied independent hands-on projects, including those in catalysis, quantum materials, polymers, nanocomposites, medical materials, and environmental remediation. Beyond research, students get impactful training through career pathway and professional development, a 1\u20132-day industrial laboratory rotation, safety, ethics, and harassment seminars, and a series of working lunches with professionals from academics, industry, and government laboratories. The REU Site promotes inclusion of underrepresented groups and provides research and career training that effectively prepares participants for graduate programs and professional careers in advanced materials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
