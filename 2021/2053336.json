 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable a critical tool for fast, high-performance measurement for precision parts manufacturing. High-precision parts are typically checked during manufacturing using fixed gauges based on 20-to-30-year-old technology costing several million dollars a year in maintenance and can take 2-3 hours using contact methods, out of a total of 20-24 hours of machine time.  Improved measurements of parts in process will lead to better manufacturing practices and higher-quality parts. The proposed capability would reduce the time required for this step by a factor of 8 to 10, making in-process measurement more economically viable as well as improving machine utilization in a plant by as much as 20 percent, potentially driving savings of over $100 million per year industry-wide.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the development of new techniques needed to create a long-range, high-precision laser triangulation gauge usable on a wide range of surfaces.  Traditional laser triangulation gauges have changed little in the past 40 years, providing a reliable but limited point or profile measurement used widely in manufacturing today. Current laser gauge range-to-resolution is around 2000 to 1, achieving perhaps 4000 to 1 in special circumstances.  A range-to-resolution capability of 50,000 to 1 would greatly expand the application potential of such gauges.  The proposed project reimagines the basic mechanisms in triangulation gauges to separate the measurement process from the noise inherent in laser-based systems.  Rather than imaging a laser spot from the part surface, the method will use a direct angular measurement of the light. This objective will be realized by adapting phase measurement methods not used in triangulation gauges today. The anticipated result will be a gauge with micron-level resolution over distance ranges of 300 millimeters and over variations in surface finish and texture.  This capability will fill a critical void in measurement tool capability for manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This monitoring may involve a wide range of sensors from thermal and power monitoring of machines to the geometry of parts in-process.  The tool our team has investigated is focused on the need for high precision dimensional measurements in the micron region over extended measurement ranges of tens of centimeters needed to control the production of such parts as aircraft engine cases and airfoils as well as generator and power train components. The customers for this technology include aircraft engine builders as well as transmission builders for automotive and heavy equipment.  It is common in these industries to produce tens of thousands of airfoils, hundreds of machine cases and millions of power trains parts/gears (in automotive) each week.  These parts are often checked using fixed gages based on 20- to 30-year-old technology that for a typical plant can cost several million dollars a year in maintenance. \n\nOur team investigated an advanced, long measurement range, high resolution non-contact metrology sensor that has the potential to provide speed and performance improvements for many of these checks.  For example, information from aerospace companies indicates that an aircraft engine case can have several tens of measurements needed during the process so as to correct for small machine errors and flex of the part during machining.  The current process for a large case can take 2 to 3 hours using contact methods out of 20 to 24 hours of machine time.  These contact methods use a short-range or contact probe with a mechanical system which must slowly and carefully move to each measurement point so as to not damage the part or probe. With the proposed capability, a straight-line sweep of a non-contact probe across several probe points a time can produce a time savings of 8 to 10X.  This time savings could improve machine utilization in a plant by as much as 20 percent for savings of several million dollars in cost savings in one plant alone each year. \n\nCurrent triangulation sensors use a single detector array or position sensing detector to view an image of the laser spot on the part surface. Finding the accurate center of this spot image is complicated by speckle noise and irregular patterns from different surface textures that limit the resolution per a given range of measurement.  The target measurement range for the investigated solution is 250-300-millimeters with a 5 to 10-micron measurement resolution (1 sigma). To achieve this capability, Optical Metrology Solutions has investigated a method using a high-speed phase detection system using multiple parallel detectors to permit a triangulation-based phase measurement of distance at up to a kilohertz rate. This capability will greatly expand the application potential of optical gages for in-process measurement over current gages and will fill a critical void in measurement tools capability for manufacturing. \n\nWhat Primary Challenges were Addressed?\n\nOptical Metrology Solutions has researched a method using high-speed phase detection methods using an approach similar to many commercial optical 3D mapping systems today.  As a point measurement device, the approach can use either line scan cameras or multiple detectors (photodiodes) to permit a triangulation-based phase measurement of distance at kilohertz rates. This capability will fill a critical void in measurement tools capability for manufacturing.\n\nThe research effort has focused on several key challenge areas related to the viability of a phase detection-based triangulation gage.\n\nWhat is the best approach to creating the best pattern for measurement.  The options explored included the use of gratings, interference patterns and imaging methods.\nWhat is the best configuration for detecting the signal.\nWhat is the best light source (laser, LED, super-luminescent diodes) to provide the long measurement range and measurement localization. \nWhat analysis will provide robust measurement of the patterns.  \n\n\nFor each of these key areas, the team has conducted extensive experimental tests on each sine wave generation method, system configuration, light sources and analysis approaches identified which has quantified each of these parameters.  The result is valuable data that is of potential use for this application as well as many related optical instrumentation applications.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin Harding"
