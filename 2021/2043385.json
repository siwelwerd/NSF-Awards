 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project's vision is to encourage sustainable mobility habits that can take advantage of new mobility services. There are enormous debates over whether emerging mobility services (like ride-hailing and bikesharing) are complementary or competitive to public transit. This project believes it would be beneficial to experiment with specific forms of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) in the urban core of a congested metropolitan area (e.g. Boston), wherein public transit can focus on high-quality \u201cmass\u201d transit while allowing for emerging mobility services to complement and feed into public transit. Modern ICTs can provide travelers with a richer set of mobility alternatives that suit individual circumstances and affordability. This project envisions a pilot program that provides low-income workers in targeted communities with mobility service bundles at subsidized costs. Low-income workers can then increase their use of active mobility (which has health benefits) and multi-modal shared services to access more opportunities. The MaaS model also provides tangible benefits for the COVID recovery plan, wherein buses from low-demand routes can be repurposed to better match demand on high-volume routes without eliminating options for car-less individuals on the low-volume routes. This project hopes to learn how preferences for different non-car services vary by time, circumstance, and affordability, in order to extend our findings to the design of a long-term MaaS model that can reverse the trend of rising car ownership in Metro Boston.\r\n\r\nThis project has already analyzed public transit ridership (from MBTA and Transit app) and commuting flows (from US Census Bureau) to preliminarily identify communities and bus routes that are most suitable for the pilot. Low-income commuters along identified bus routes will be recruited to participate in a stated preference survey, which will used to identify willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-switch for alternative (non-private-car) mobility services. Such alternatives include overlapping commuter rail routes (e.g. Fairmount Line), bikesharing, and mobility-on-demand  (EZRide/ private shuttles/ ride-hailing). Based on the survey, this project will design a randomized controlled trial that provides voucher programs for targeted individuals. Subsidy levels could even be adjusted periodically based on real-time peak-hour public transit overcrowding data provided by Transit app. MaaS vouchers will be distributed among recruits during the pilot phase, and data on real-time mobility choices will be collected for two months. Finally, this project will evaluate the effectiveness of providing flexible MaaS at both the individual level (e.g. sustainable mobility choices and increased accessibility) and the system level (e.g. lower risk of overcrowding on high-volume bus routes and lower car use). This project is supported by the CIVIC Innovation Challenge program Track A. Communities and Mobility: Offering Better Mobility Options to Solve the Spatial Mismatch Between Housing Affordability and Jobs through a collaboration between NSF and the Department of Energy Vehicle Transportation Office.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis planning grant involved a collaboration of public, private, and academic partners to design and formulate a pilot project for improving urban mobility.  The pilot provides a flexible, transit-oriented, mobility-as-a-service approach for improving sustainable and equitable mobility within neighborhoods close to the inner core of a metropolitan area ? in this case, Boston, MA.  A particular concern is that increased auto-dependence and congestion in Metro Boston has reduced accessibility for low-to-moderate income (LMI) households.  The pilot tests whether integrated, multimodal mobility packages can improve the mobility of  LMI households in the inner suburbs in a sustainable and less car-dependent manner.\n\nThe pilot was designed to identify mobility packages and pricing that can expand affordable mobility services available to low-income workers without requiring any significant new technology.  Through focus groups and meetings, the planning grant has enabled community engagement with cities, community organizations, and residents in the design of the pilot project.   Research partners included Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), Bluebikes, and Transit.app.  Civic Partners included the Metropolitan area Planning Council (MAPC), the Cities of Everett and Chelsea, the Everett Community Growers, the Everett Haitian Community Center, and Green Roots Chelsea.\n\nThe pilot should increase awareness, understanding, and use of emerging mobility services (such as bike sharing and ride hailing) without reducing the use of public transit.  Participants are offered packages of multi-mode mobility services that simplify travel mode choices and offer bike sharing and ride-hailing discounts for travelers who make frequent use of public transit.  The intent is to increase accessibility for LMI households and help them meet mobility needs without the necessity and cost of car ownership.  \n\nThe planning grant helped the collaborating organizations prepare a Stage 2 proposal for a one year, one million dollar pilot project to test the viability of such a flexible, transit-oriented, mobility-as-a-service program and to determine how participants respond to different mobility packages and prices.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph Ferreira"
