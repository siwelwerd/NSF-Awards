 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer models can be used to augment, inform, and even replace expensive experimental measurements in science and engineering. However, complex models of engineering applications can quickly exceed computational capability, driving the need for advanced simulation tools. Applications in high-frequency wave simulation--such as submarine sonar (acoustics), fiber optics (electromagnetics), and structural analysis (elastodynamics)--pose a significant challenge for large-scale simulation. This project advances computational modeling capabilities through the development, documentation, and dissemination of a leading-edge simulation software. The effort builds on decades-long research and code development by the investigators and their project collaborators. Distributed as open-source, the software is accessible to the broader scientific community, thereby contributing to fundamental research and education for computer modeling in science and engineering. Furthermore, the project expands the national workforce by training young computational mathematicians at the graduate and postdoctoral levels. The project results are disseminated through conference presentations, workshops and seminars, as well as publications in scientific journals.\r\n\r\nThe hp3D software leverages hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelism to run efficiently on NSF extreme-scale computing facilities and interfaces with state-of-the-art third-party scientific libraries. In addition to publishing the hp3D code and documentation, this project focuses on the development of a scalable multigrid (MG) solver based on the pre-asymptotically stable discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) finite element method. This DPG-MG solver represents a significant advancement in solver technology as 1) the first robust, scalable solver for problems with highly-indefinite operators, such as high-frequency wave propagation; and 2) the first multigrid solver with support for fully anisotropic hp-adaptive hybrid meshes and a reliable built-in error indicator. Serial implementations of the DPG-MG solver have demonstrated near-linear scaling with respect to degrees of freedom in both time and memory; its parallel implementation significantly expands scientific compute capabilities and enables solution of currently intractable problems in 3D wave simulation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
