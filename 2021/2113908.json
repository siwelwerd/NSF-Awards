 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lakes are a dominant feature of the Arctic landscape and can be important sources of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, but large-scale Arctic carbon budgets usually neglect carbon emissions from lakes. Moreover, studies of carbon emissions from northern lakes have largely been limited to regions where lakes are connected to thawing permafrost.  Emissions from lakes located in drier landscapes, which cover about 25% of the northern permafrost region, have been relatively understudied. Consequently, it is uncertain to what degree lakes located in drier regions contribute to carbon emissions, a problem that likely will worsen as much of the Arctic is predicted to become warmer and drier in the future.  This project addresses both critical gaps. First, the researchers are using automated sensors to measure carbon emissions from lakes in West Greenland, a region experiencing rapid warming and declining precipitation.  The researchers are also synthesizing their lake emission measurements with previously published observations to assess how differences in climate patterns impact fluxes of carbon dioxide between lakes and the atmosphere.  The results of this research will be presented in interdisciplinary academic panels, popular science magazines, youth science programs, and discussed with West Greenland communities. \r\n\r\nThe Kangerlussuaq region in West Greenland located along a hydro-climatic gradient serves as a model landscape for studying the implications of warmer and drier Arctic conditions for carbon dynamics in inland waters. The researchers are quantifying carbon emissions from a suite of lakes along a climate-precipitation gradient that mimics shifts from cooler and wetter climate to drier and warmer conditions throughout the whole year, using high-frequency, in situ sensors. These sensors are providing the first annual, temporally well resolved measurements of carbon dioxide emissions from lakes in poorly hydrologically connected, arid Arctic landscapes. The researchers are upscaling their measurements to the regional level and comparing them with terrestrial carbon fluxes in the surrounding landscape. This research is highlighting the heterogeneity of the Arctic carbon cycle and its role in the full Arctic system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project focused on quantifying CO2 emissions from lakes in arid Arctic areas, which cover a large spatial extent (~50% of the northern permafrost area). This is an important missing piece of the Arctic carbon cycle, as prior research indicates that these lakes are carbon sinks, but CO2 emission data are scarce despite the high abundance of these systems. To address this key knowledge gap, we measured CO2 emissions from lakes located in West Greenland, one of the most arid Arctic regions. Combining manual monitoring and high-frequency CO2 sensors, we quantified CO2 fluxes from 12 lakes. To provide context for lake CO2 emissions measured in West Greenland, we compiled and synthesized previously published CO2 emissions from lakes and other waterbodies in Arctic regions with different climatic and landscape characteristics. We found that under dry conditions, CO2 flux data suggested that the lakes served as carbon sinks in the summer. However, our synthesis work demonstrated that lakes in wetter regions emit less CO2 at an annual scale compared to lakes in arid landscapes. Variability in CO2 emissions also increases with aridity of the landscape and is the highest in low-elevation, low-relief watersheds. This high variability in CO2 emissions across arid landscapes highlights the need for more mechanistic understanding in order to better quantify the magnitude of CO2 fluxes in upscaling efforts.&nbsp;This funding supported the work of a female doctoral student, who successfully completed her Ph.D. with this award. The CO2 data collected in this project contributed to three manuscripts that will lead to publications in scientific journals, and to a talk at an international conference. To broadly disseminate the results of this research beyond publications in scientific journals and conference presentations, we embedded a journalist in our field team to observe the scientific work firsthand; she produced a popular science article in an online news outlet about this research. We also presented results at the Greenland Science Week and participated in community discussions about climate-driven changes in Sisimiut, Sarfannguit, and Kangerlussuaq, Greenland.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 10/22/2024<br>\nModified by: Jasmine&nbsp;Saros</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2113908/2113908_10741341_1729595137666_6c0e13ac_f4c4_4996_bdf8_672b2a7e6eef--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2113908/2113908_10741341_1729595137666_6c0e13ac_f4c4_4996_bdf8_672b2a7e6eef--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"winter sampling\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2113908/2113908_10741341_1729595137666_6c0e13ac_f4c4_4996_bdf8_672b2a7e6eef--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"winter sampling\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Hazukova prepares to deploy a CO2 sensor through the lake ice</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Amanda Gavin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jasmine&nbsp;Saros\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">winter sampling</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2113908/2113908_10741341_1729595269872_IMG_0179--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2113908/2113908_10741341_1729595269872_IMG_0179--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"ice deployment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2113908/2113908_10741341_1729595269872_IMG_0179--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"ice deployment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Deployment of the CO2 sensor with its flotation buoy through a hole in the lake ice</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vaclava Hazukova</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jasmine&nbsp;Saros\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ice deployment</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2113908/2113908_10741341_1729595351508_IMG_6644--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2113908/2113908_10741341_1729595351508_IMG_6644--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"Lake sampling\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2113908/2113908_10741341_1729595351508_IMG_6644--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"Lake sampling\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Field team heading out to sample carbon dioxide flux from a lake</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Adam Heathcote</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jasmine&nbsp;Saros\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Lake sampling</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
