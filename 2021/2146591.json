 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalysis plays an essential role in facilitating fast and energy-efficient manufacturing of fuels and chemicals from raw feedstocks.  Most fuels and chemicals are still derived from fossil fuel resources.  However, significant research progress has been made in recent years exploring alternative, renewable and/or sustainable chemical processes, based on electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and other electrically powered technologies such as microwave- and plasma-assisted catalysis.  Following this trend, the project explores the feasibility of magnetically inductive catalysts for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction to carbon monoxide (CO) under mild, energy-efficient reaction conditions.  In addition to mitigating carbon emissions - in the form of CO2 from combustion sources such as power plants - the CO product can be used to manufacture a wide range of organic chemicals and hydrocarbon fuels via established downstream processes.  The project extends prior catalysis research related to magnetic inductive heating through a convergent approach integrating nanoparticle technology developed for biomedical applications with both advanced experimental and theoretical methods of heterogeneous catalysis research.  The NSF EAGER (EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research) funding mechanism is ideal for this study aimed at assessing the feasibility of novel technology that is risky, but potentially transformative in maintaining U.S. leadership in clean energy technology.  Beyond the technical aspects, the project includes educational and outreach initiatives contributing to the education of K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students, with significant emphasis on broadening participation of individuals from underrepresented groups.\r\n \r\nThe project builds on the inductive magnetic hysteresis caused by response of ferromagnetic materials to an alternating magnetic field.  Since the heat is generated directly at the catalyst surface, it can be efficiently delivered to the catalytic species.  Because of this, reactor feeds may not need to be heated, allowing operation at milder conditions than typically employed in thermal catalysis. While electricity must still be supplied to generate the magnetic field, the more efficient heat transfer creates an opportunity to significantly increase catalytic reactor efficiency by designing materials that are optimized for energy delivery and catalytic performance.  The project integrates simulations and experiments to design, characterize, and evaluate magnetically inductive nanoparticles for the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.  The project includes collaboration with Johnson Matthey to assess translational potential; for example, to facilitate fast light-off for automotive exhaust catalysts.  The project also explores opportunities for creating a range of magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles doped with other metals to tune catalyst reactivity and selectivity while maintaining efficient energy transfer.  To that end, the project will include a modeling component that predicts magnetic properties and their relationship to catalyst performance.  In addition, the alternating magnetic field associated with the inductive heating creates opportunities for dynamic catalysis.  Potential risks associated with the technology will also be addressed, including catalyst composition and structure limitations (e.g., magnetic properties as a function of particle size and composition), temperature limitations (e.g., phase stability under reaction conditions), and oxidative stability.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
