 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although pandemics have threatened human civilization since ancient times, how to predict and prevent them remains a pressing challenge, calling for innovative insights and practices. Pandemics emerge through incidental \u2018perfect storms\u2019: molecular changes in pathogens, gradual trends in climate, subtle shifts in ecological interactions among potential hosts, and individual behavioral decisions by people, all colluding to make up the difference between an interesting but rare new variant of a known disease and an existential worldwide crisis. Being able to predict the emergence of pandemic threats, therefore, requires a fully integrated, multidisciplinary approach, able to consider the complexity of these realms across scales of interaction to predict and, ideally, prevent.  This workshop is one of four bringing experts from scholarly communities in the social and behavioral sciences, biology, engineering, and computer science together to discuss how to integrate the approaches taken by each community into a more effective, unified science of pandemic prediction.  The focus of this workshop is on developing understanding of how human attitudes, social behavior, and the drivers underlying both shape patterns of infectious-disease transmission and efforts at control and eradication.  This fundamental understanding in turn will facilitate pandemic prevention and control decisions that leave us better prepared when confronted with future pandemic threats.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is structured to focus on four topical areas of crucial importance, dealing with cultural transmission, information and communication, equity, and sustainability. The white paper that comes from this workshop will provide important guidance for incorporating insights into the social and behavioral sciences into predictive intelligence and pandemic prevention.   It will inform future research investments, institutional capacity-building, and other policy priorities aimed at keeping the US and the world safe from inevitable future pandemics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Control of infectious disease depends critically on reducing effective contacts within the suspected population.

Workshop was held on March 22-23rd, 2021 to gather information on what is currently known about the human dimensions of pandemic preparedness and control and where the gaps lie. The online workshop brought together over 250 researchers and practitioners from diverse fields. The workshop had four themes:&nbsp;1) Cultural Transmission, Identity, and Groups, 2) Equity, Access, and Community Engagement, 3) Information, Communication, and Misinformation, and 4) Sustainability, Longevity, and Institutional Memory of Preparations. The online workshop included anchor talks, panel presenters, interactive discussions, and was professionally facilitated and documented. Each session included an anchor talk and three other panelists, reflective of diverse disciplinary areas, perspectives, and demographics. Data collected during the two-day workshop was analyzed for a summary report that was shared with the National Science Foundation and with the public via the project website:&nbsp;https://humanpipp.org/workshop-report.&nbsp;A main recommendation from the workshop was expanded training opportunities and research support dedicated to increasing the participation of social scientists in work on pandemic prediction, prevention, mitigation and control.
