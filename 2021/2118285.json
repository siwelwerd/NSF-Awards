 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate-change induced loss of polar ice sheets impacts many lives and increases coastal flooding by rising sea level and affecting ocean circulation. However, it remains difficult to accurately predict how quickly the ice sheets will continue to shrink. In particular, we are still challenged by a limited understanding of transdisciplinary processes that determine ice sheet change, such as the role of subglacial topography and ice-atmosphere-ocean interactions. Timely investment in machine learning and data intensive research can revolutionize the way that scientists currently answer questions related to ice dynamics. This HDR Institute serves as a research hub where experts in data science, Arctic and Antarctic science, and cyberinfrastructure in academia, government, and private sectors come together to develop transformative and integrative data science solutions to reduce uncertainties in projecting future sea-level rise and climate change. i-HARP researchers investigate the potential of novel physics-aware data science and machine learning approaches to address national priorities and challenges on Navigating the New Arctic, climate change, and sea-level rise.\r\n\r\nThe HDR Institute aims to harness massive heterogeneous, noisy, and discontinuous data in space and time and integrate data with numerical and physical models. Researchers at i-HARP are investigating novel data science techniques including deep generative adversarial networks, graph neural networks, meta learning, hybrid networks, physics-informed machine learning, causal artificial intelligence, data assimilation, spatiotemporal deep learning, and scalable algorithms. Due to the fundamental nature of data science problems that i-HARP addresses, the solutions can be translated to other disciplines such as remote sensing, medicine, and autonomous driving. Moreover, the convergence team champions multiple clusters of research-integrated educational initiatives, with a specific focus on facilitating cross-disciplinary collaborations, training next-generation multi-disciplinary researchers and engaging the public in scientific inquiry as related to climate change and data science. In partnership with related communities, i-HARP designs curricula, and offers hands-on community workshops, lecture series, conference tutorials, and training. i-HARP engages students from underrepresented minority groups by leveraging several existing organizations for underrepresented minorities.\r\n\r\nThis project is part of the National Science Foundation's Big Idea activities in Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR).  This award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Section for Antarctic Sciences and the Section for Arctic Sciences within the NSF Office of Polar Programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
