 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to demonstrate product-scale properties of photo-patternable quantum dot (QD) inks. These include: 1) scalability, 2) long lifetime under device operation, and 3) compatibility with display manufacturer protocols and facilities. Following the demonstration of these parameters, the ink can be commercialized in partnership with a large chemical manufacturer for global distribution. The photo-patternable QD ink is a novel product that will enable display manufacturers to produce the next generation of high color gamut, triple energy efficiency, and high refresh rate displays for consumer electronics (e.g. TVs, monitors, laptop screens, smartphones, wearables, and virtual reality and augmented reality headsets). Such an ink can broadly impact an $8.4 billion market by 2024 by simplifying the manufacturing and improving the performance of organic light emitting diode (OLED) and micro light emitting diode (microLED) displays recently announced by companies such as Apple, LG, BOE, and Samsung. Furthermore, the efficiency improvement in displays made by the project\u2019s success could reduce carbon emissions by as much as 110 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e), contributing to broader environmental impacts. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project focuses on converting a ligand chemistry into an ink product by demonstrating performance at production scale. The intended product is a photo-patternable QD ink that enables high resolution patterning of red and green QD downconverters to enable a tri-color display with excellent color gamut, energy efficiency, and refresh rate. To date, resolution and conversion efficiencies meeting customer requirements have been demonstrated for the ink at the film level. In this project, the focus will be on the end product - a functioning display enabled by this ink technology. To accomplish this, the project objectives are: 1) to develop lifetime metrology tools and techniques; 2) to develop a protocol and demonstrate the film lifetime simulating device conditions; 3) to scale the ink formulation to 20 L/y to enable a sufficient number of tests; and 4) to produce a prototype at production scale with an industry collaborator. The successful completion of these objectives will yield a working display device that is enabled by the QD ink product. A demonstration of a device is critical evidence to engage customers and convince them of the compatibility of the ink with their product.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
