Bridging the research fields of strongly correlated materials and topological quantum materials, the research team will use thermoelectric effect and thermal Hall effect to reveal the physical origin of recently observed novel phenomena of strongly correlated materials: (1) quantum oscillations in electrical resistivity of Kondo insulators; (2) large thermal Hall effects in Mott insulating state of the undoped parent compound of high-temperature superconductors, and (3) topological superconducting state in Fe-based superconductors. These directions are new exciting developments in long-standing puzzles in condensed matter physics. They share the same debate about the role of the charge-neutral quasiparticles in the strongly interacted states: what carries these interesting phenomena: magnon, phonon, and Bogoliubov quasiparticles. The research tasks will answer these questions: (1) What is the nature of the quantum oscillations in insulators? (2) What leads to the metal-like thermal transport in Kondo insulators? (3) Why are Hall signals of the heat flow in undoped cuprates? (4) How to couple to quantum anomalous vortices in Fe-based topological superconductors? The answers to these questions shed light on the ground state of the strongly interacted quantum systems. The research also leads to effective ways to probe charge-neutral quasiparticles in strongly correlated quantum materials and reveal the crucial characteristics in these material systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
