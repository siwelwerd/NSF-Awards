 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator seeks to increase our understanding of mathematical shapes, called manifolds, which are of particular interest to both physicists and mathematicians.   One important class of manifolds are those that are everywhere positively curved or flat.  The term \"positive curvature\" refers to curving like a sphere; a very large sphere is approximately flat, and so has a small but positive curvature.  On the other hand, a very small sphere has a very large curvature.  This project will focus on these objects through international collaborations, as well as through undergraduate research projects.\r\n\r\nThe PI's work is motivated by the recent breakthrough of Goette, Kerin, and Shankar on finding metrics of non-negative sectional curvature on so-called codimension one biquotient foliations.  These spaces generalize the well known cohomogeneity one manifolds, and all have a decomposition as a union of two disk bundles glued together along their common boundary.  The PI will work on developing a method of classifying such objects.  This includes studying the classification of non-simply connected biquotients, as well as developing obstructions at the level of cohomology for a manifold to admit such a structure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThanks to the generous support of the NSF, the PI has been able to attend many conferences, form international collaborations, visit colleagues to conduct research together, and mentor undergraduate research experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong other conferences, the PI was able to attend the workshop \"Curvature and Global Shape (CGS)\" both in 2021 and 2023 held in Mnster, Germany. This conference draws all the top experts from the PI's field and is the perfect opportunity to learn the cutting-edge techniques and ideas in his field and meet new people.\n\n\nIn particular, at the 2021 workshop, the PI met David Gonzlez-lvaro (Universidad Politcnica de Madrid, Spain), beginning a very productive collaboration. The work done by David and the PI drew in further collaboration with Michael Albanese (University of Adelaide, Australia), Miguel Domnguez-Vzquez (Universidade de Santiago de Campostela, Spain), and Alberto Rodrguez-Vzquez (Universit Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium). None of this would have happened without the support of the NSF.\n\n\nThe PI also independently began a collaboration with Martin Kerin and Fernando Galz-Garca (both at Durham University). As part of this collaboration, the PI visited Martin while he was at the University of Galway (Ireland).\n\n\nFinally, due to the summer support the PI received, he has been able to mentor two separate undergraduate research projects involving Evan Sherman (2021) and Peyton Johnson (2023). The PI was even able to fund Peyton's stipend through his grant. Both projects culminated in a published article, so the students were able to participate in the entire process of conducting and disseminating research. In addition, both students gave presentations on their work at the Mathematics Association of America Southeastern sectional meeting. Both Evan and Peyton have since completed their undergraduate degrees, and upon graduation, both began to pursue graduate degrees in mathematics.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JasonBDevito\n"
