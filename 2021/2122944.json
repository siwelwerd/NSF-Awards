 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation \u2013 Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project is to reduce agricultural losses due to powdery mildew infection of grapes. The wine and grape industry is a multi-billion dollar US industry which is heavily impacted by powdery mildew disease. Powdery mildew disease in grapes can dramatically reduce grape yield and product quality. Every grape-bearing acre is treated with pesticides throughout the growing season, with powdery mildew control accounting for 89% of California grape pesticide costs. Because of increasing powdery mildews resistance to current pesticides and increasing powdery mildew disease pressure due to climate change, new methods to control powdery mildew in grapes are required. The team has developed a technology for powdery mildew control in grapes. The technology takes advantage of a naturally occurring process called RNA interference (RNAi) in which small RNAs, specific to a target, can prevent the target protein from being made. RNAi products are biodegradable and highly specific with minimal off-targets making them attractive as more environmentally benign alternatives than current treatments. The powdery mildew control product in development has a novel mode of action with the added benefit of multiple effective targets, compatibility with commercial spraying practices, and enhanced safety compared to current pesticides. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project addresses the pressing and widespread problem of powdery mildew disease in agriculture, focused on grapes. The research team brings together a multidisciplinary group to develop a prototype RNAi powdery mildew control product with performance features required by end-users in the field. This product development includes target and delivery optimization and assessment of end-user minimal viable product features in the greenhouse and field. The project may result in intellectual property, a refined commercialization plan, and strengthened and new partnerships between academia and industry. Training in entrepreneurship of women and minorities is an important component of this project, which is led by women and will include women and minority Agriculture Innovation Undergraduate Interns.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
