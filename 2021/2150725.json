 "awd_abstract_narration": "As one of the first natural disasters striking the continental United States since the COVID-19 outbreak, the 2021 Winter Storm has caused severe economic and health damage in Texas as millions of residents lost electricity and water supply amid the record-breaking cold outbreak and an ongoing pandemic. In response to these challenges, this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project assesses the influence of extreme weather, power outages, the COVID-19 pandemic, and online social network use on Texas residents\u2019 access to resources and information embedded in their social network (i.e., social capital) and recovery from the winter storm (i.e., disaster resilience). Additionally, the research seeks to identify if the use of public (e.g., Twitter) vs. invitation-only social networks (e.g., Nextdoor) alleviates or exacerbates the disparity in social capital and resilience. Findings from this project on the one hand help us understand the long-term influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on our society, while on the other contribute to the design and implementation of future disaster relief programs targeting underprivileged communities in the U.S.\r\n\r\nUtilizing a longitudinal survey targeting residents of 108 counties in Texas with major disaster declaration, this project seeks to achieve three objectives. First, it identifies the influence of socioeconomic status, extreme weather, power outages, and the COVID-19 pandemic on Texas residents\u2019 access to social capital during the 2021 winter storm. Second, the proposed project pinpoints the extent to which the use of different online social networks (i.e., public vs. invitation-only online social networks) facilitated Texas residents\u2019 access to bonding, bridging, and linking social capital during the winter storm. Third, it seeks to identify the extent to which online social network use and social capital acquisition mitigated the psychological, physical, and financial impacts inflicted by the winter storm and power outages.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Through an expansive longitudinal survey study, we have cast light on the relationship between the usage of online social networks and community resilience amid a severe disaster. During the winter storm, many Texans faced extreme disruptions in essential services such as electricity, heating, and water. The distress was further exacerbated by a large proportion of participants being displaced from their homes. Amid these hardships, our research discovered a surge in the use of various social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and NextDoor.The research primarily had three significant findings. First, as illustrated above, we observed the disastrous impact of the storm, with a majority of participants experiencing utility losses and emotional distress, reemphasizing the importance of robust disaster response infrastructure. Second, the study revealed the crucial role of online social networks, such as Facebook, Nextdoor, and Twitter, in providing access to bonding, bridging, and linking social capital, which is important to people's lives in different social scenarios. Notably, Facebook usage correlated positively with all types of social capital, while Nextdoor and Twitter users reported more bridging and linking capital, which are particularly valuable for underprivileged individuals. The study shows that such access to social capital significantly aids disaster recovery, underlining the vital role of online social networks during such crisis scenarios. Our third significant finding was the relationship between disaster exposure and perceptions of climate change. Participants with a more severe winter storm experience were more likely to perceive climate change as an immediate threat, with this effect being stronger among those with a robust belief in climate science.The project's intellectual merit lies in its in-depth exploration of the role of online social networks in facilitating access to social capital during a natural disaster and how this access contributes to recovery. The insights generated have significant implications for designing effective disaster response strategies, especially in the digital age.In terms of broader impacts, the project has influenced public understanding and attitudes toward climate change and disaster management, enhanced infrastructure for research and education, and provided opportunities for underrepresented groups. The study findings have been integrated as teaching material in a Risk Communication course, enriching the learning experience of graduate students. Also, we are developing an AI-powered emergency broadcast network, drawing insights from this project to enhance community resilience through social capital and online social networks.We have disseminated our results to the broader academic community through multiple conference publications and upcoming journal papers. Our findings have also been shared with key media production teams, disseminating the information to the public and informing public understanding and attitudes toward climate change, disaster management, and the role of online social networks in disaster scenarios.In conclusion, this NSF-funded project has yielded essential insights into disaster resilience, online social network use, access to social capital, and climate change perceptions.
