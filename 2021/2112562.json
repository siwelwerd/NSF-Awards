 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National AI Institute, named Athena, seeks to kindle and fuel a transformation in modern edge computing by leveraging next generation networks. Led by Duke University, Athena taps the ongoing revolution in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and brings together a multidisciplinary team from seven universities: Duke University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Princeton University, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Yale University. Athena organizes its research activities under four interrelated thrusts - AI, Computer Systems, Networking, and Services - which constitute an ambitious and comprehensive research agenda. It will develop AI-driven, next generation technologies for edge computing and new algorithmic and practical foundations of AI. Athena will evaluate the research outcomes through a combination of analytical, experimental, and empirical instruments, especially with target use-inspired research. Athena is committed to a robust and comprehensive suite of educational and workforce development endeavors alongside its collaboration and knowledge transfer efforts with external stakeholders that include both industry and community partnerships.\r\n \r\nAthena aims at scientific contributions in both edge computing and AI. These include (i) edge networking mechanisms across the stack by leveraging a data-driven, AI-based approach; (ii) systems support for efficient and reliable AI across the edge-enhanced mobile networks; (iii) novel practical and algorithmic foundations of AI to ensure the new functionalities, efficiency, scalability, security, privacy, and fairness of the AI solutions adopted in these next-generation networks; and (iv) novel services and applications, focused on diverse cyber-physical systems that leverage the innovations of the other thrusts. Athena\u2019s research outcomes will benefit the network and computer industries at large. This national institute will work closely with external collaborators to translate research outcomes to industrial practice and policymaking. The educational and outreach activities of Athena will empower students and postdocs to develop their interests, build skills, and acquire knowledge about AI and computer and network systems through research experiences, industry internships, and community engagements. The Inclusive AI Initiative \u2013 one of Athena\u2019s innovations in education and workforce development - will strengthen the ethical AI competencies of all Athena members to better promote and be aware of equity and fairness in their research and the communities impacted by the institute\u2019s research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
