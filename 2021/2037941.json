 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to reduce postharvest loss due to toxins and insect damage while increasing the returns for farmers.  In the US, an annual $3-5 billion dollars of crop value is lost due to toxin, insect and moisture mismanagement that could have been prevented through the introduction of affordable and accessible monitoring technology during product storage.  Additionally, rising carbon dioxide levels in production agriculture create 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions.  This project will validate the feasibility of low-power, wireless sensors that can detect grain storage conditions.  The project will also enable buyers in the grain marketplace to ensure that the grain they are purchasing is, in fact, from fields where sustainable practices are implemented.  This technology will help validate the feasibility of tracking grain across the supply chain to create trust and new business models around sustainability-verified grain. \r\n \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to advance internet of things automation and wireless sensor applications as applied to production agriculture and the postharvest supply chain.  There are certain manual processes of farm production that are strenuous due to time burdens and the lack of information available to make decisions.  One such process is monitoring grain assets in farm bins, commercial storage, and barges, though this is important for the safety of the global food supply.  This technology is focused on sensing for loss and spoilage risks and connecting and turning the data into automation opportunities.  Cable-based monitoring solutions currently exist, but adoption is restricted due to physical installation limitations, electricity/power constraints, and investment costs.  This project will validate the feasibility of low-power, wireless sensors that can detect grain conditions and last a full postharvest cycle (18 months).  Such a device will create opportunities to track grain qualities across the agriculture value chain, advancing its current use in on-farm grain bins.  By characterizing and testing smart kernel sensors this project will provide business model applications of tracking mechanisms in the grain supply chain.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project commercialized the first wireless grain bin monitoring technology stack to help farmers and commercial grain handlers automate post-harvest processes. The works outcome is a scaled technology and feature set called ACE AIR, used daily on grain bins across the country.\n\n\nEach year $5 billion is lost in the grain supply chain due to toxin, insect and moisture mismanagement that could be prevented through the adoption of practical automation tools on equipment. The best time to aerate grain can be at the weirdest hours of the night, or worse, during peak times of the day when operators are busy with other tasks. Proper aeration matters because all grain is priced and traded based on moisture baselines, and over or under drying grain can lead to price docks. Legacy technology in the supply chain is anchored to cable-based temperature and moisture sensing technology. Fewer than 10% of the supply chain has adopted automation due to these technologies burdensome infrastructure, high costs, and extensive maintenance requirements. FarmersSaveand grain handlers have been left to run these processes manually based on guesswork and their own availability to be onsite.\n\n\nThis project advanced technology to automate storage processes through a wireless, low infrastructure approach to grain monitoring. Commercialized was a first-of-its-kind, wireless, predictive CO2 sensor, that competitively replaces the need for temperature cables, called, Analyzer; and a wireless fan controller in conjunction with weather and predictive modeling that supplements the need for moisture cables, called Automator. The two devices, alongside an App and analytics software, form a self-install, technology suite marketed as, ACE AIR: the no-cables way to monitor grain bins.\n\n\nThrough the development of the Analyzer, the grant validated the use of CO2 analysis in the headspace of grain storage environments as an earlier detection metric of grain spoilage than in-grain temperature sensors. Upon completion of the findings, alert thresholds anchored to CO2 readings were devised for safe, inspect, and take action, recommendations. The grant also supported improving the manufacturability of the device, ensuring that the technology could meet an adoptable price point.\n\n\nThrough the development of the Automator, the grant supported the creation of a new, app-based workflow to help users consistently execute on their grain conditioning objectives. The dashboard combines post-harvest education, forecast driven aeration recommendations, push-button control, and engaging notifications. A seven-day, weekly routine was constructed around the aeration automation scheduling process to gamify the grain storage season for the farmer and commercial elevator. These features automate tasks, reduce the user's workload, proactively alert on quality issues and recommend improvements on storage practices over time.\n\n\nAltogether, the ACE AIR product experience commercialized through this grant, brought to market a new technology offering within a price point which will increase the adoption of monitoring and automation across the grain supply chain. The technology kit provides farmers and grain handlers with the earliest alert to grain tipping out of spec and helps them catch the right air at the right time to capture the highest possible price for their grain. ACE AIR is currently protecting grain in every breadbasket state, Canada and Mexico.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/03/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LucasFrye\n"
