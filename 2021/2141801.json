 "awd_abstract_narration": "Participants in this workshop seek to advance understanding of emergent security challenges in the Arctic, evaluating the multiplier effects of accelerated climate change on environmental, economic, and social systems. They explore to what extent conventional security assumptions are appropriate for understanding the dynamic Arctic strategic landscape and address issues such as threats to infrastructure, international hazard response, and public health. \r\n\r\nThe workshop is structured to foster discussion and debate, stimulate new research agendas, and provide opportunities for attendees, including graduate and undergraduate students, to become more familiar with pressing Arctic issues. Five graduate students and ten undergraduate students selected through a competitive process will have the opportunity to participate, with emphasis on recruiting from a diverse applicant pool. Other activities include a student essay contest and outreach to local middle and high school students through the University of Southern California\u2019s Center for Active Learning in International Studies (CALIS).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
