 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hybrid materials, incorporating both organic and inorganic components, are currently being engineered to create new materials with properties controlled by nanoscale composition and morphology. The Research Triangle Research Experience for Undergraduates (RT- REU) will leverage the strength of collaborative research on hybrid materials, specifically hybrid perovskites, together with the integrated nanotechnology tools of the RTNN to provide a state-of-the-art research experience on a timely research topic that has direct and tangible technological applications (e.g. solar cells, lighting, lasers). Undergraduate participants in this program will conduct novel research under the guidance of an experienced faculty mentor at UNC-Chapel Hill, NC State University, or Duke University. A heavy emphasis during recruiting will be placed on students who have limited opportunities to pursue research at their home institutions. In addition to the in-lab research experience, student activities include synchronous and asynchronous instruction in hybrid perovskites and nanoscopic characterization techniques, professional development and enrichment activities, networking and social activities, and experience with oral and written communication of their research. Each REU participant will be also paired with another participant working in a similar area at a different institution in the REU site collaboration. This integrated program will enhance inter-institutional collaboration, advance research projects, and provide an impactful research experience for REU participants.\r\n\r\nThere are three objectives for this REU program: (1) To provide a hands-on research experience in hybrid perovskite materials that reinforces student knowledge of cutting-edge characterization techniques and analytical tools that can be used to evaluate the nanoscopic structure of hybrid perovskite systems; (2) to foster student interest in pursuing a career in STEM fields; and (3) to develop communication and networking skills in each of the participants. Student participants will gain exposure to and experience with state-of-the-art synthesis, modeling and characterization tools as applied to a contemporary research topic on hybrid organic-inorganic materials. Students will gain new perspectives on engineered hybrid material systems and will directly apply this knowledge to the improvement of system designs and/or the investigation of novel properties and applications. Students in the program will be exposed to advanced tools and techniques in RTNN facilities and will not only become users themselves but will also bring their knowledge, expertise, and connections to their home institutions. The proposed program will also connect students to other sites in the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI) network, which will help students to build a scientific network and support system for future STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (Directorate for Engineering), and the Division of Materials Research (Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
