We hope to build the diversity of the mathematics community by providing opportunities for women and underrepresented students at this early stage in their training. The ability to communicate mathematics is emphasized and groups give weekly presentations, receiving constructive feedback from their mentors and peers throughout the summer, culminating in talks at regional and national undergraduate research conferences. We have a weekly colloquium (learning) seminar where mentors and visiting researchers give accessible talks on their own research. There are numerous professional development activities, graduate school admission events and panels, and workshops on presenting and writing mathematics. Students write final papers and results are submitted for academic publication. \r\n\r\nYale is a vibrant international center for research and students are fully immersed in the Yale research community during their summer on campus. Each summer 24 undergraduate students work on one of six projects, each project directed by a faculty mentor. The mentors choose a problem from their own field of research, which include: differential geometry, graph theory, homogeneous dynamics, metric number theory and dynamics, groups and symmetry, combinatorics, hyperbolic manifolds, data recovery, image processing, and topological data analysis.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
