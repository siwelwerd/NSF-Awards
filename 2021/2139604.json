 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern data analysis in economics and other sciences often involves situations in which researchers are interested in making predictions about or explaining the behavior of many individuals; researchers may also be interested in how a single factor affects an outcome but have to include several other factors in explaining the outcome of interest.  Testing for statistical uncertainty surrounding the measured effects in these situations is difficult and existing methods do not provide precise and efficient ways to measure this uncertainty. This research project will develop new and improved methods for accessing statistical uncertainty associated with effect measurements in both situations. These situations arise routinely in economics and other social science research that addressing many policy questions, and accurate methods for assessing uncertainty are important for providing good policy recommendations. The results of this research project will help improve the quality of policy evaluation and statistical prediction and as result, provide policy makers with better advice.  This will contribute to better policy outcomes, hence foster faster economic growth in the US.\r\n\r\nThis research project will develop new methods to test statistical uncertainty in high-dimension data estimation in two settings.  In the first setting, we develop a general method for constructing intervals that satisfy an average coverage property: the intervals cover a prespecified fraction (95%, say) of the true effects on average. Focusing on average coverage allows us to form intervals that automatically reflect efficiency gains from data-driven regularization, including empirical Bayes methods, and estimators of a regression function based on machine learning techniques. Such gains are not possible under the usual notion of coverage, under which a coverage guarantee is required for each effect individually, not just on average. In the second setting, we focus on the usual notion of coverage. To obtain informative confidence intervals, we exploit a priori restrictions on the magnitude of the control coefficients. We show that our construction enjoys several optimality and near-optimality properties.  The results of this research will improve the quality of policy advice and as a result increase the rate of economic growth in the US.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nModern empirical work in economics and related fields often uses large scale data. Such applications typically take one of two formes: (i) making predictions or estimates for many effects or units (such as evaluating teachers, schools, physicians or hospitals) or (ii) estimating a single effect while using many controls to hold certain features of the environment fixed. This project has developed methods to deal with both of these settings.\n\n\n\nFor setting (i), this project has developed methods for uncertainty quantification that take into account bias from shrinkage or empirical Bayes estimators in a robust way. The proposed method takes the form of an interval that contains a given proportion of the effects on average. This notion of coverage, while technically different from classical formulations of a confidence interval, leads to coverage guarantees that are equally useful for many practical purposes when many effects are being considered. In contrast to classical confidence intervals, the approach developed in this project allows one to fruitfully use shrinkage or empirical Bayes estimates to take advantage of modeling assumptions that may be only approximately correct.\n\n\n\nFor setting (ii), this project has developed distinct methods for two settings of particular interest. The first setting involves many control variables which do not have any additional structure other than bounds on the magnitude of the effects of these variables. The second setting involves a panel structure, in which units are observed over time, and the control variables take a form that can be described using a certain type of interactive fixed effects model. These methods isolate variation in the variable of interest in a way that avoids bias from additional variables to the extent possible, while also taking into account remaining bias when making statements about uncertainty surrounding the estimates.\n\n\n\nThe methods developed for setting (ii) require an explicit bound on the magnitude of effects of control variables. A separate paper develops methods for estimation that avoid specifying such a bound by mimicking a hypothetical oracle with knowledge of this bound. These methods are developed in detail in a specific setting involving model misspecification, but the approach generalizes to other settings. Finally, an additional paper investigates the scope for using control variables to gain accuracy in experimental settings.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/26/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: TimothyArmstrong\n"
