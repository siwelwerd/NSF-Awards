 "awd_abstract_narration": "A description of nature at its most fundamental level is comprised of a set of fundamental pieces \u2013 elementary particles \u2013 and an explanation of the forces between them that should describe all matter and phenomena in the physical universe.  The \"Standard Model\" encompasses everything we know about the normal matter that surrounds us. The Standard Model does not, however, describe everything that has been observed and, in particular, does not explain how the universe evolved with more matter than anti-matter and what additional particles and forces may exist. The muon, like the electron, is an elementary particle which is prevalent in Nature.  But the muon is radioactive and not part of normal matter. Measuring the magnetic and electric properties of the muon with great precision is one of the most promising ways to explore \u201cnew physics\u201d and requires developing technologies for controlling and detecting magnetic fields. These technologies have broad applications to medicine, geological exploration, and defense. This research will measure the fundamental properties of the muon and the neutron as well as to provide exceptional training for a diverse cohort of undergraduates, graduate students, and post-docs.\r\n\r\nThe PI will collaborate on the Fermilab Muon g-2 experiment. His primary role is to lead the effort to measure the magnetic field because it connects the muon spin precession frequency to the magnetic moment anomaly and the Standard Model. The absolute He-3 magnetometer developed for the Fermilab Run-1 magnetic field calibration chain will be improved and used for calibration of the NMR magnetometer that transfers calibrations to all the probes in the magnetic storage ring.  The PI will collaborate on direct measurement of the magnetic moment of the He-3 nucleus using Penning trap techniques, and will continue the development of low-field absolute He-3 magnetometry in collaboration with commercial partners. The electric dipole moment of the neutron will also be measured using the world's leading ultra-cold neutron source at Los Alamos National Laboratory. In particular, the PI will advance novel approaches to monitoring the magnetic field using an array of magnetometers and technologies and develop new approaches to study of systematic effects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
