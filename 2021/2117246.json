 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Boston College is acquiring a 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with liquid nitrogen cooled probe to support the research of Professor Thusitha Jayasundera and colleagues James Morken, Jianmin Gao, Jeffery Byers and Jia Niu. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as permitting study of chemically and biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. The probe uses nitrogen-cooled radiofrequency coils that deliver a much greater sensitivity enhancement over room temperature. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution as well as collaborators from neighboring colleges including primarily undergraduate institutions. In addition, the instrument is part of activities involving the NSF funded Boston College Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program and the Paper to Plastics (P2P) summer program, as well as other outreach initiatives, such as the Women in Science and Technology (WST) program. These programs are largely composed of women, first generation students, and/or minorities that are under-represented in STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts the development of non-noble metal-based catalysts and the characterization of synthesized molecules to interrogate biomolecules that cannot be targeted pharmacologically, commonly referred as \"undruggable\". The instrumentation is also used for developing new synthetic methods for applications in organic chemistry and for identifying macromolecules prepared with tailor-made structures and sequences. In addition, it allows the characterization of species used in metalloradical catalysis and for understanding molecular interactions in microbiome communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
