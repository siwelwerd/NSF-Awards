 "awd_abstract_narration": "This anthropological project focuses on the redistribution of water, a key physical process linking the Arctic region to coastal cities worldwide. In order to evaluate responses to glacial melt and rising sea levels, this project will \u201cfollow the water\u201d to coastal cities most affected by Arctic melt using the \u201cgradient fingerprint map\u201d (GFM). The GFM calculates how much water each global melt basin is contributing to urban coastal sea-level rise. By tracking how physical processes link the Arctic with urban centers to the south, this research will test the validity of \u201chydrological globalization,\u201d an interdisciplinary social scientific concept that frames social adaptations to hydrological processes, asking whether sites physically connected through global water flow share responses in the form of discourse, policy measures, economic planning, and infrastructure development. \r\n\r\nThis site-based study involves ethnographic and document-based research, including interviews with government officials, scientists, industry experts tasked with scenario planning, and members of non-governmental organizations. These participants will provide expert insight on the types of urban adaptations policy makers and planners are using to respond to rapid sea-level rise. Media monitoring, evaluation of national policies and legal documents, and study of local and national activism will provide background and context for informant interviews. This research will advance understanding of human responses to Arctic change and how those responses vary culturally and geographically. Broader impacts include presentations to public audiences at each site, involving compelling human-focused narratives that illustrate the links between the Arctic and urban sites to the south. Dissemination of findings through local media, white papers, and reports to stakeholders targets broader international audiences and may inform urban policy and planning.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In 2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a special report on how climate change is affecting the world&rsquo;s oceans, as well as glaciers, ice sheets, and sea ice. While there is a general awareness that melting glaciers result in sea level rise, before this project there had been no research focused on how communities contending with the physical phenomena of melting ice and rising seas may also share social and cultural adaptations to these environmental impacts. Our research used the tools of anthropology&mdash;interviews, site-visits and field research to understand the social dimensions of climate adaptation in places being deeply, if differently affected by changes to the world&rsquo;s water system. Our work centered attention on a key physical process that links the Arctic region to lower latitude coastal cities&mdash;namely, the redistribution of water from ice to ocean&mdash;to examine shared social, political and cultural adaptation responses in four exploratory research sites.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Importantly, the project was designed around a new NASA modeling tool developed by physicists, the &ldquo;gradient fingerprint map&rdquo; (or GFM). The GFM calculates how specific parts of the world&rsquo;s ice sheets and glacier basins are contributing to sea level rise in 293 coastal cities. It can pinpoint contributions from all the major sites of melting ice on Earth&mdash;from the Himalayas to Antarctica and from the Canadian Arctic to the Southern Andes. The GFM shows, for instance, that Cape Town, South Africa, is more affected by Icelandic melt than any other coastal city in the world and that Greenlandic melt impacts sea level rise in Honolulu, Hawai&#699;i more than any other city in the United States. Using this innovative scientific tool, our social scientific research examined whether places that are physically-linked by meltwater are engaging in similar or dissimilar adaptation practices and priorities in terms of their city and regional planning, infrastructural objectives, scientific priorities and community engagement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because the EAGER grant is meant for exploratory research, our objective was to build networks with experts (such as coastal engineers), institutions (like government agencies involved with environmental planning), and communities being affected by changes to ice and ocean in each of our four field sites (Iceland, Greenland, Cape Town and Honolulu). We collected extensive, initial ethnographic data in each site and found many points of convergence and divergence between and across each location.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our project yielded several important findings that enhance public understanding of climate impacts and climate adaptation responses across the world. In&nbsp;<strong>Iceland</strong>, for example, we found that the loss of glaciers has become a significant public concern in the past decade. Glaciers offer important resources for Icelandic hydropower and fisheries, but they also are considered to help Icelanders connect to their history and culture. There is evidence that awareness of glacier loss has prompted Icelanders to accelerate changes to their infrastructure to help save their ice.&nbsp;<strong>Greenland</strong>, meanwhile, faces a different set of challenges associated with the diminishment of its glaciers and icesheet. Greenlanders expressed less concern with the loss of ice&nbsp;<em>per se&nbsp;</em>than with how glacial retreat has sparked a new &ldquo;gold rush&rdquo; for minerals, including iron ore, lead, zinc, diamonds, gold, rare earth elements, and uranium. Although some Greenlanders see economic promise in mining, many more are worried about sustainability and negative environmental impacts and connect these directly to climate change.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Research in&nbsp;<strong>Honolulu</strong>&nbsp;revealed that sea level rise and coastal erosion are front-of-mind issues for many Hawaiians. Both communities and the government worry about the impact of coastal erosion on the islands&rsquo; roads and are exploring different approaches to coastal defense, including retreat. In areas with extensive tourism like Waikiki Beach, hotel owners now struggle to keep seawater out of their basements during king tide events. An unexpected finding is that Hawaiians express a great deal of concern about how climate change will impact food security since so much food is imported and dependent upon ports that could be disabled by a major storm or hurricane. Finally, research in&nbsp;<strong>Cape Town</strong>&nbsp;revealed that sea level rise is not yet a matter of significant public attention outside of a few areas that have seen substantial coastal erosion. However, water is certainly on people&rsquo;s minds. Capetonians have alert to issues of freshwater scarcity since the city nearly ran dry in the &ldquo;Day Zero&rdquo; drought of 2018. Since then, the city has made strides to guarantee new water sources in local aquifers. However, experts now know that one of the largest of these aquifers is susceptible to salination through sea-level rise which would compromise an important source of drinking water over time. Capetonians were very glad to learn about this research project as they understand that sea level rise will inevitably be a bigger part of their climate adaptation planning in the future.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 08/31/2024<br>\nModified by: A.
