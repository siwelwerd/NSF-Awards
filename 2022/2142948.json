 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the continuation of the CyberCorps\u00ae: Scholarship for Service (SFS) project at the University of South Alabama (USA) that promotes cybersecurity education and research excellence to prepare graduates to work in critical cybersecurity positions within the federal government's executive workforce. This project will support 20 students, with a mix of 3-year undergraduate-to-masters, 2-year masters, and 3-year doctoral students, and it builds on the institution's strong commitment to cybersecurity education and research. For example, cybersecurity components are included in USA\u2019s undergraduate Computer Science and Information Technology programs, master\u2019s level Computer Science and Information Systems programs, and a doctoral program in Computing. These academic paths produce graduates who can fill a wide range of cybersecurity positions, from network security analysts to advanced cybersecurity researchers. USA has a record of meeting the needs of a diverse student body, and a high percentage of the students come from rural or financially depressed areas. Moreover, in the current cohort of scholars, 34% of CyberCorps\u00ae students are female, and 16% are members of ethnic groups that are underrepresented in their pursuit of careers in the field. The project team expects to maintain and exceed this diversity during this renewal award by increasing targeted recruiting, community awareness, and long-term K-12 STEM outreach efforts.\r\n\r\nThe USA program builds upon four foundations: 1) the resources of the University of South Alabama and its School of Computing (SoC), 2) the academic programs within the SoC, 3) a mature and dynamic cybersecurity curriculum across SoC programs along with experienced faculty who support both cybersecurity research and education, and 4) the strength of a vibrant research center focused on forensics, information technology, and cybersecurity. USA's scholars benefit from core fundamental cybersecurity coursework and cutting-edge cybersecurity research. The project aims to recruit and graduate 20 students over four cohorts. USA's project team provides tailored academic and research mentorship with a goal to achieve 100% program completion and placement into cybersecurity positions with a targeted focus on employment within the federal executive workforce. The success of program objectives will be assessed using both internal and external reviews.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
