 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given its focus on extended temporal spans of human behavior, archaeology is particularly well suited to examine long-term trends in how communities devise both technological and social adjustments to threats to their stability, and how those strategies may culminate in large-scale population relocations. The research team will adopt the perspective of political ecology to compare and contrast how societies mediate broad transformations in their climatic and ecological surroundings through a process of locally-based decision-making. The project will develop new methods for addressing deep time approaches to the study of environmental change and migration. Further, it will promote educational and training opportunities for Native American students and involve interpretive collaboration with Native American communities.\r\n\r\nCollaborators from the University of Florida (Dr. Charles Cobb), the University of Mississippi (Dr. Edmond Boudreaux), the University of South Dakota (Dr. Anthony Krus), and the Chickasaw Nation (Dr. Brad Lieb) will embark upon a multi-year archaeological study of the causes underlying an extensive population abandonment of mid-continental North America during the fifteenth century AD. This phenomenon, covering about 50,000 square miles, is popularly known as the \"Vacant Quarter.\" Archaeological research elsewhere has shown that climatic factors commonly play a central role in large-scale regional depopulations, and recent evidence suggests that a series of severe multi-decadal droughts struck eastern North America in the AD 1300s and 1400s. These droughts appear to have been the result of wide swings in precipitation caused by the period of global cooling known as the Little Ice Age. Nevertheless, there is extreme variability in the ways in which societies adapt to environmental as well as social stresses. The project will involve a comparative study of a number of archaeological sites in two sub-regions, central Tennessee and northern Mississippi, in the larger abandoned region. Both areas witnessed an apparent exodus of people about AD 1450. However, prior to that time, they had very different histories of occupation culturally and ecologically. The research team will combine excavations with ceramic sourcing analyses, subsistence studies, and examinations of conflict to address similarities and differences in population movement, foodways, and warfare in the two study areas resulting from deterioration in their ecological and social surroundings, and how these processes ultimately led to contemporaneous mass migrations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIn the fourteenth to fifteenth centuries C.E. a very large portion of the North American mid-continent, stretching from the modern cities of St. Louis, MO to Nashville, TN, was abandoned by Indigenous societies. This region was occupied by sedentary Native American communities strongly reliant on maize agriculture, with the largest towns numbering in the thousands. This occurrence, commonly referred to as the Vacant Quarter phenomenon, has puzzled archaeologists for decades. It is widely believed that severe multi-decadal droughts were in part responsible, but that does not explain why communities occupying a large variety of ecosystems all left within such a narrow timeframe. This project is the first systematic and comparative intra-regional study of the Vacant Quarter. A central hypothesis is that, while climate may have been an underlying cause of abandonment, that peoples in different regions mediated the timing and nature of their departures based on social responses to surrounding ecological instability. The archaeological results of our study to date seem to support this conclusion. Bayesian modeling of the timing of abandonment of our first study area, the Middle Cumberland region of central Tennessee, reveals an upsurge in the decline of towns in the early 1400s and they all seem to be abandoned within fifty years after that. Similar chronological modeling of our second study area, the Tombigbee drainage of eastern Mississippi and western Alabama, shows a less synchronized and more variable timing of abandonment from the late 1400s to the 1600s. Our comparative work, combined with other lines of research, also shows that conflict was endemic in the Middle Cumberland region and that peoples departed relatively rapidly for relatively distant areas such as the Ohio Valley or eastern Tennessee. In contrast, communities in the Tombigbee region appear to have filtered more slowly in a westward direction to a nearby, but very different, ecosystem known as the Black Prairie. Studies of intraregional population movement, based on ceramic compositional studies, confirm that life within both of these study areas was characterized by considerable population movement and volatility. Contrary to expectations that diet breadth would become more diverse as populations sought to offset subsistence risk, however, our preliminary botanical analyses suggest that towns in both regions seemed to be concentrating more strongly on maize at the expense of many wild plants and traditional North America cultigens (e.g., sunflower, sumpweed). Although we are still uncertain as to why the two regions witnessed somewhat different histories of abandonment, it seems that their variable responses to major climatic shifts were structured by inherently different population densities (with the Middle Cumberland region containing many more and larger sites), variation in conflict (much more common in the Middle Cumberland region), relative access to eco-niches more resilient to drought (such as the Black Prairiefor reasons as yet unknown), and perhaps simple distance from the major impact areas of the droughts, which paleo-climatological modeling suggests were more severe in the Tennessee region.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/15/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: EdmondABoudreaux\n"
