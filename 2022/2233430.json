 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific networks are at the heart of the National Science Foundation\u2019s (NSF) AccelNet program and its goals to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and to prepare the next generation of U.S. researchers for multi-team, interdisciplinary, international collaborations. Networks in this case are not just a metaphor but can also be a quantifiable object of study that can be documented, analyzed, evaluated, and acted upon. To that end, this project will offer an intensive three-part workshop series for participating AccelNet Teams to: 1) learn how their goals related to increasing collaboration can be thought of in the terms of social network analysis and network science, 2) gain the skills and experience to collect and curate network data related to their project; and 3) analyze and visualize their data to make informed decisions about their AccelNet network to inform their project\u2019s strategy and assessment. \r\n\r\nIn these three virtual workshops, intended to be taken in sequence, each team will be shown examples of published scientific collaboration studies (and ongoing case studies of two AccelNet Teams the investigators are involved in: GLASSNET and AccelNet-MultiNet) and will be introduced to ways they can collect their own data through existing sources (like bibliometric databases or administrative records) and/or through new sources (such as network surveys or observation). Participants will be given detailed workflows and example scripts for collecting and analyzing data and provided technical support and office hours after each workshop to complete their work. The project will also disseminate an assessment template that the AccelNet teams can utilize to establish baseline graphs and to assess and report the growth and development of their networks over time by updating and monitoring their networks using a common approach. Workshops will be recorded, and materials archived and open for public use at the conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations (AccelNet) program is designed to accelerate the process of scientific discovery and prepare the next generation of U.S. researchers for multiteam international collaborations. The AccelNet program supports strategic linkages among U.S. research networks and complementary networks abroad that will leverage research and educational resources to tackle grand scientific challenges that require significant coordinated international efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
