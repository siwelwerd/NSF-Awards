The event serves as the official annual meeting of the International Chinese Statistical Association (ICSA) and provides the broader statistical community a unique opportunity to meet and exchange ideas. The main objective of the conference is to bring together both well established and junior researchers from around the nation and the world who are actively pursuing theoretical and methodological research in statistics, biostatistics, and data science as well as their applications. The conference will provide a forum for discussion of cutting-edge developments in statistical theory, methods, and tools for making accurate inference from complex and noisy data sources.  \r\n\r\nThe format of the conference includes multiple plenary talks, special invited talks, invited sessions, and contributed posters. The organizers strive to enhance diversity of speakers and maintain a healthy inclusive atmosphere. In addition, a special panel discussion will be organized on mentoring and career development, especially geared toward women and researchers from groups underrepresented in STEM. For students, the conference will provide opportunities such as a student paper competition and contributed poster sessions.  The website with details on the symposium is https://symposium2022.icsa.org/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
