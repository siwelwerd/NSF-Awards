SODA is one of the few\r\nmajor conferences with broad coverage of Theory of Computing and\r\nDiscrete Mathematics. SODA has a record of strongly encouraging\r\nparticipation by students, for whom the conference serves as a valuable\r\neducational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and\r\nfor the opportunities for networking that it provides. This award will\r\nprovide partial support to about 20 students/postdocs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
