 "awd_abstract_narration": "An utterance is grammatical if it conforms to the speaker's mental grammar. But grammatical utterances may be ambiguous. Ambiguity, the assignment of multiple representations and interpretations for one utterance, is an undesirable byproduct of language use for efficient communication; nevertheless, ambiguity is pervasive in language performance, since mental linguistic representations have a hierarchical structure, yet language externalization is linear due to sensory-motor constraints. This Hybrid-Architecture Symbolic Parser and Neural Lexicon system (HASPNeL) judges whether a given utterance is grammatical and detects whether it is ambiguous at the word or sentence level. HASPNeL is also a computational cognitive model of human language following current syntactic theory on Minimalist grammars, which must satisfy conditions of learnability, evolvability, and universality. Although the advantages of a hybrid symbolic-probabilistic architecture have been documented in relevant literature, there is not yet any comparable system based upon this architecture. HASPNeL is expected to impact the development of applications for education and industry (particularly applicable to underrepresented languages for which there is not enough available data), and to further research and advancement of human language cognitive models and technologies.\r\n \r\nHASPNeL's hybrid architecture comprises a feature-unification parser and structure generator, which is encoded using a symbolic AI approach, and a machine learning tagger that is used to construct a feature-enriched lexicon. An annotated synthetic corpus trains a neural network system that properly identifies and tags each lexical item and estimates the likelihood of each category within the corpus. To account for lexical ambiguity, tokens with different categories, features or meanings are assigned different entries. The system only parses grammatical utterances, recognizes ambiguous utterances by producing as many syntactic representations as there were possible interpretations, and calculates the likelihood for each structural description. HASPNeL is able to account for syntactic variation by minor parametric adjustments to grammatical and lexical features.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by MSI and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
