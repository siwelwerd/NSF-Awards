 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I Project is to improve environmental testing. Once class of contaminants is PFAS (Per- And Polyfluoroalkyl Substances), associated with high cholesterol levels, thyroid disease, certain cancers, and pregnancy-related problems. Current testing costs $300 per sample and offers low throughput is low at 30 samples per day. The proposed project develops a test that would cost $50 per sample (6X reduction) and could test about 120 samples per day (4X increase).  It could initially offer a rapid, low-cost qualitative screening tool, allowing users to determine areas of concern, hot spots, detection during emergency response and testing during mitigation efforts. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop a novel immunoassay in the form of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), two of the most abundant PFAS in soil and water. Currently, PFAS testing involves laboratory-based, costly LC-MS (Liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry) methods. An antibody test such as an ELISA has specificity to the target compound as well as any similarly structured compounds. Thus, the test will detect multiple species of the perfluorinated compounds.  During the development of PFAS ELISA, verification testing will be done in an EPA lab using LC-MS to verify the species that can be detected by the ELISA test along with the accompanying levels of detection.  The research will include determination of the appropriate immunogens and haptens for this application, antibody production, and screening of antibody for specificity and sensitivity. The goal is to improve PFAS detection sensitivity to 50 ppt.  Once technical feasibility of detection is demonstrated, the antibodies can be used to develop more complete assays using test strips or magnetic particles.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOutcome report:\n\nSummary: \n\nThe ultimate objective of this project was to develop an innovative ELISA for the detection of PFAS, particularly, PFOA and PFOS in soil and water. ELISAs are preferred technology due to their sensitivity, specificity, and ability to tolerate pretreatments plus it is rapid and cost effective as well. PFAS ELISA involves the development of critical components such as hapten, immunogen, and an antibody since no antibody is available commercially for PFOA or PFOS.\n\nFindings: When one has an antibody that is specific to a specialized group of compounds like PFAS, it can become an easily manufacturable product known as ELISA.  What is very hard about it, is which animal(s) do you choose to inoculate with an immunogen and what should that immunogen be?  And how does one minimize the number of animals used for this study?  Because the combinations of which conjugation to use, which spacer arms if any to use and which protein to conjugate the specialized chemical, are in the thousands.  It would be completely impractical to do them all, not to mention, many animals will not yield the truly desired product of antibody that could make a very cost effective, easy to use ELISA.  So, the goal is to take educated guesses and go from there.\n\nMany of our immunogens used in ELISA to produce antibodies involved conjugations to KLH.  It was thought that perhaps PFOA was not a long enough chain molecule when it is directly conjugated to BSA, so the idea was, use a spacer arm to make a more effective immunogen for the rabbits to respond to. The two spacer arms chosen were PEG2 acid which was suggested by conjugation company and 4-pyridinal-2 acetic acid which was selected based on our experience. The other choice was to conjugate PFOS to these same spacer arms in addition to PFOA.  Our conjugation company needed to use another chemical in place of PFOS.  We agreed to give it a try. Both were conjugated to the individual spacer arms and then to KLH for injection into rabbits.  Each immunogen was injected into two rabbits.  So, a total of eight rabbits were used in this project.  All rabbits did not detect the PFOA or PFOS as inhibition assays did not show any sensitivity to PFOA or PFOS.  Later we tested for reactivity against the original immunogens, and we saw signal down to a 1:1968000 dilution.  So, we decided to test each rabbit sera against unconjugated immunogens (used blue carrier protein instead of KLH) and we saw the same reactivity to blue carrier protein down to a 1:1968000 dilution.  We discovered that all eight rabbits were reacting to the KLH only.\n\nThen we tried conjugations using BSA, OVA and thyroglobulin and when we injected rabbits to these, we discovered that they were still strongly reactive to the KLH/Blue Carrier protein (again at a 1:1968000 dilution).  But we also noticed that they were more cross-reactive with whichever protein was used for the immunogen.  In other words, if the PFOA was conjugated to BSA, the sera saw the BSA down to a 1:24000 dilution.  Again, this is not the desired result.\n\nWe came up with an idea to try a mixture of immunogens containing either PFOA or our PFOS alternative to BSA, OVA and thyroglobulin each in one of the eight rabbits.  The idea was to minimize each protein in the injection to the rabbit, so the rabbit does not produce so much antibody to any specific protein.  Only one rabbit out of eight showed inhibitions to PFOA and PFOS. It showed inhibition down to the 15ppb level for PFOS and 20ppb level with PFOA. Based on the results, we injected all eight rabbits with the same mixture of immunogens to see if all rabbits produce the same inhibition results. Testing showed that none of the other rabbits showed inhibition except the one that was already showing inhibition before.  One rabbit that responded showed the top OD650 around 0.5 vs. preferred 1.5 OD. \n\nConclusion and recommendation of the Project:\n\nAt the end of Phase I project, we achieved sensitivity down to 15ppb level for PFOA and PFOS.  We plan on trying to inject a totally new rabbit with the mixture of immunogen attached to the PFOS alternative chemical so that the rabbit does not strongly react to KLH.  We start injecting rabbits around 100ug and monitor its cross reactivity with BSA, OVA and thyroglobulin and check if cross reactivity increases with each injection. \n\nAnother thing to try is to use cationized versions of BSA, OVA and thyroglobulin immunogen to inject current rabbits.  The idea is to have more sites on each protein conjugated to a PFAS compound instead of only the normal available N-terminal sites.  In a cationized protein, the C-terminal sites are changed to an N-terminal site.\n\n.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/03/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sejal Patel"
