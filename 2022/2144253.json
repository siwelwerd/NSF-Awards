 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nThis Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will support research to reveal how bacteria grow and adapt at the interface of water and oil, and at the interface of water and air.  Films of bacterial aggregates, also called biofilms, are a ubiquitous form of microbial life. When they grow on solid-liquid interfaces, they can cause health problems like infections near joint implants. When biofilms grow at air-liquid interfaces, they can cause lung problems.  How biofilms grow and adapt at these interfaces is not well understood.  This work will first explore how bacteria cope with changes in surface tension and energy.  Next, this work will study how bacteria\u2019s adaptation to changing conditions can be manipulated to create new materials.  Finally, this work will suggest how viruses and nanomaterials could be used to control bacterial development at fluid interfaces.  The results of this work will ultimately be relevant for treating chronic lung infections or developing more effective treatment of crude oil spills using bacteria. Moreover, these research activities will motivate students to pursue STEM careers. The project will adapt professional engagement strategies to develop pre-college and college experiences for minorities, first-generation, and financially challenged students. It will promote an inclusive climate and facilitate these students\u2019 academic success through a range of mentored experiences. Educational activities include a \u201cBugs as Materials\u201d Camp, a college application workshop, and a summer experience for undergraduates.\r\n\r\nThe physicochemical mechanisms that regulate microbial growth in biofilms remain poorly understood, in part because of the versatility of microorganisms\u2019 ability to respond to diverse environmental conditions. Even less well-known are the mechanisms governing the growth and metabolic responses of biofilms formed at the fluid interface. To test the overarching hypothesis that bacteria metabolize a patch of an interface and secrete a protective coating to thrive under harsh interfacial conditions, three objectives will be pursued: (1) systematically elucidate the viscoelastic properties and the physiology of interfacial films; (2) characterize the effects of phenotypic adaptation of bacteria under interfacial confinement on interfacial film mechanics; and (3) determine how the mechanical integrity of mixed interfacial films is altered by chemical and biological insults. Model organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, will help elucidate how films at bacterial interfaces form, and how the rheological properties are altered by physical, chemical, and biological insults.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
