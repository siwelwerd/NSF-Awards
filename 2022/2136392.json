 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to use a biotechnology based Membrane Biofilm Reactor (MBfR) to recover valuable materials, including platinum group metals (PGM), Rare Earth Elements (REE), and other critical minerals and materials (CMM) using the natural metabolic processes of bacteria. These materials are used in battery and energy storage, semiconductor manufacturing and other industries.  The demand for some of these valuable materials is likely to increase by as much as 4000% by 2040 and the USA is dependent on other countries for some of these products. Limited supply of PGM and REE is exacerbated by processing and recycling facilities losing \u226510% of the total market value of these materials in their wastewaters.  The MBfR directly addresses this loss by recovering up to 99% of the lost PGM and REE as solid nanoparticles. Based on the concentration of valuable metals and co-contaminants in water samples provided by valuable-metals recyclers, a conservative 90% recovery of precious metals using the MBfR may generate more than six times the return on investment (ROI) for the customer in the first year.  This project may help mitigate risks associated with materials shortages and moderate costs as demand continues to increase.  The recovery of these materials from wastewaters may also avoid serious hazards to human and ecosystem health associated with their discharge.  \r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project is organized into five objectives through which the company seeks to quantify the reduction and precipitation kinetics in relation to their hydrogen-delivery capacity.  The company will also characterize the metal and mineral nanoparticles according to their chemical composition, purity, and size, as this affects how they can be used in industry. The objectives of the project include: continuous recovery of PGM and REE using the MBfRs, solid-state characterization of recovered PGM and REE in the MBfRs; characterization of PGM/REE-recovering biofilms in the MBfRs, and the development of a techno-economic analysis and technology-to-market strategy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis STTR Phase I project advanced a novel environmental biotechnology for recovering Platinum Group Metals (PGM) from wastewater streams from mining, ore-processing, and recycling industries. The environmental biotechnology is the Hydrogen-based Membrane Biofilm Reactor (H2-MBfR), in which bacteria utilize H2 gas to convert polluting PGM ions into highly valuable elemental nanoparticles. The PGM are among our nations critical materials due their essential roles in green chemistry and renewable-energy technologies.\n\n\nThe research involved operating H2-MBfRs in laboratory-scale pilots to remove and recover four PGM: Platinum (Pt), Palladium (Pd), Ruthenium (Ru), and Rhodium (Rh). Experimental results in batch-mode and continuous-flow experiments documented removal of Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt and their recovery as nanoparticles in the H2-based MBfRs. Excellent removals were achieved in synthetic media and in an actual metal-refining wastewater that was pre-treated to be compatible with a microbiological process. Removals ranged from 95% to 99% in batch tests and from 72% to 98% in continuous flow using the synthetic media. Removals in the actual wastewater ranged from 82% to 99% for batch tests. Solid-state analyses documented that the biofilm in the MBfR retained the PGM nanoparticles, making them available for harvesting.\n\n\nWe conducted a Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) to evaluate the economic viability of the H2-MBfR for PGM recovery. We carried out the TEA using the characteristics of the actual refining wastewater and used the experimental results we obtained with that wastewater. Due to the high value of the recovered PGM nanoparticles, the capital investment in an H2-MBfR system was rapidly recovered: The payback period on the capital investment was only 1.2 years. In particular, the levelized cost of PGM extraction by the H2-MBfR was only about $1 per gallon, which is small compared to the economic value of the PGM in the wastewater: $10-$25/gallon. Since the continuous-mode experiment was for proof-of-concept, not for optimization, we anticipate that the per-gallon treatment costs can be substantially reduced by further research and development.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CalvinHRay\n"
