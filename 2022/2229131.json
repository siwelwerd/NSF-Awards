 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a new approach to manufacturing computer memory, a critical component in modern computing and data storage. Currently, memory technologies are made from silicon wafers, which require expensive instruments to pattern. It is also increasingly difficult to shrink the size of the memory device using this approach. Our approach will leverage DNA\u2019s self-assembly properties and two-dimensional (2D) materials to overcome this manufacturing bottleneck. 2D materials are atomically-thin films and have outstanding electrical properties. Leveraging DNA\u2019s size will create nanometer-scale templates to pattern and modify 2D materials. Our experiments are complemented by atomic-scale theoretical models of these systems, to advance memory technologies in both storage and computing applications. Results from this research will advance semiconductor technology for the U.S. and benefit the nation\u2019s economy and security. This research is a close collaboration between chemists, material scientists, and electrical engineers from three research-intensive universities, a four-year college, a community college, and a historically black university. This project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact science and engineering education.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that DNA nanostructures can pattern defects and deliver dopant ions to 2D materials with molecular precision, and that this strategy can produce high-precision, low-variation synaptic devices. The team will use DNA nanostructures to create a defined number of defects and intercalants on single-layer graphene and molybdenum disulfide and use these modified 2D materials to fabricate synaptic memory devices. The devices are critical to enable energy-efficient computing architectures that mimic the human brain. Atomistic models will be developed to understand the material and device behaviors. The project also includes education and workforce development activities, designed to highlight the integration of biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering as a potential career path towards the future manufacturing of semiconductor devices.\r\n\r\nThis Future Manufacturing award was supported by the Engineering Directorate and the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
