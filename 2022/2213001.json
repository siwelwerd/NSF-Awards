 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). Emily Franklin is awarded a NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (NSF MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and activities related to broaden participation by groups underrepresented in STEM. This fellowship to Dr. Franklin supports the research project entitled \u201cMPS Ascend: Characterizing Contributions of Volatile Chemical Products to Aerosol Chemistry and Composition in the Modern Megacity\", under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host institution for the fellowship is Colorado State University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Delphine Farmer.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed work intends to establish molecular and compositional markers of Volatile Chemical Products (VCP)-related secondary aerosol formation through laboratory oxidation experiments, and (2) Characterize and quantify VCP-related perturbations in aerosol quantity and composition under ambient conditions in a coastal megacity. Oxidation experiments of consumer products under realistic use conditions and an observational campaign in the New York City region will inform the inform the stated objectives. The work has the potential to inform models that predict the future of urban air quality in a changing environment. The Broadening Participation plan will improve the retention and experiences of researchers from historically excluded groups in STEM and allow an opportunity to partner with the Denver area Spanish Speaking environmental justice community which may lead to community led aerosol mitigation efforts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
