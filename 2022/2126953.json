 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Broader Impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to support widespread distribution and adoption of sterilizing biopesticides that are effective and efficient to control Lepidoptera. Lepidopterans, such as the corn earworm, circumvent insecticidal properties of certain crops by developing resistance.  Models show that incorporating sterile insects in a corn earworm population can suppress the incidence of resistant individuals in the populations.  Enhancing oral infectivity of this sterilizing insect biopesticide will improve product manufacturing, distribution and most importantly, ease of use to support farmer adoption.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project develops a functional orally-infectious formula of a specific strain of the sexually-transmitted, sterilizing-virus, Helicoverpa zea nudivirus 2 (HzNV2). The resulting technology will be suitable for prototyping and testing oral formulations for sterilizing adult corn earworm moths. Genetic selection and candidate gene approaches are proposed to improve stability of the virus entry complex required for oral infectivity. This project will decorate viral envelopes with genes absent from HzNV-2 and thereby improve virion stability.  The pseudotyped virus will be assayed for increased oral infectivity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe project focused on ways to improve production and manufacture of a biological pesticide product. This product is a sterile corn earworm moth (Helicoverpa zea) that carries a specific isolate of a natural virus that sterilizes only this moth. The natural virus is the Helicoverpa zea nudivirus and causes sterility in about 20 percent of corn earworm moths that become infected whereas the isolate under development as a biopesticide sterilizes the large majority of moths that acquire the infection. Production of sterile, infected corn earworm moths in the lab prior to this project required injection of virus into adult female moths. The eggs laid by moths injected with virus develop into sterile male and female moths which are the product released into the field to protect them from corn earworm infestations. Injection of virus into moths is a laborious and inefficient process. This project hypothesized that infections could be efficiently acquired by feeding the virus to moths under optimized conditions and proposed three approaches to achieve this goal. The wild type HzNV2 is known from the scientific literature to be infectious orally with about 20% of moths that ingest virus becoming infected. This is not efficient enough to be useful in production of infected, sterile corn earworm moths. One of the proposed approaches was successful in infecting over 80% of moths that ingest the virus. This approach is now being integrated into our manufacturing processes. Taken together, the results support further research and support for such work under a Phase 2 SBIR project is pending.\n\n\nSuccessful performance of the project and achieving the goals of this project will directly enable the efficient production of sterile infected moths, the delivery of this biopesticide to growers to suppress populations of the corn earworm pest.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe corn earworm is a major pest of corn, cotton, soybean sorghum and many vegetable crops. Developing an alternative to chemical and transgenic pesticides will help to manage populations of this key pest of US and global agriculture. Furthermore, a close relative of the corn earworm, the Old World Bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, is an invasive insect in North and South America and a major threat to US agriculture. The Old World Bollworm is susceptible to infection with and sterilization by the Helicoverpa zea nudivirus and by the product being developed in this project. A sterilizing biopesticide to combat this invasive pest could be an important tool not only for managing the corn earworm but also for mitigating the effects of this new and important invasive pest, the Old World Bollworm.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/16/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: BruceAWebb\n"
