 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve clinical outcomes for patients with wearable biosensor needs.  This project will develop wearable continuous glucose biosensor platforms to address a broad set of disease and wellness applications, such as measuring additional molecules relevant to diabetes management, improving management of cardiovascular diseases, and therapeutic drug monitoring to customize dosages.  In addition to impacting human health (particularly for chronic diseases) in the United States, the commercial market is significant and valued at approximately $120 B/year.  Furthermore, these biosensors will provide data directly to patients to inform their decisions. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will address the limitations which have prevented continuous diagnostic monitoring platforms from adding clinical utility beyond sensing glucose with enzymatic sensors. Unlike enzymatic glucose sensors, electrochemical aptamer sensors are rapidly adaptable to measuring other molecules in the body with high specificity and sensitivity. However, aptamer sensors currently degrade rapidly in live animals (<6-12 hours) and must be inserted through a highly-invasive incision.  This STTR Phase I project will demonstrate robust and longer-lasting functioning of aptamer biosensors in a real biofluid environment. It will use a software-enabled method in which only one electrode is inserted, making the resulting device truly minimally invasive.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In terms of intellectual merit, Kilele Health has advanced what was previously a research-only sensor technology, called aptamer sensors, into commercially viable levels of sensor longevity and sensor designs that are compatible with use in humans.  Specifically, sensors were shown to operate for longer than 1 week continuously and demonstrated on tiny wire formats that are less than half a millimeter thick such that the sensors can be placed painlessly just beneath the surface of the skin to sense molecules circulating in the body.  In terms of broader impacts, aptamer sensors can now begin the development process to become a complete wearable monitor with similar form factor and user interaction as continuous glucose monitors, but suitable for other diseases beyond just diabetes.  The NSF Phase 1 STTR support was also critical in enabling customer discovery work that revealed compelling initial market opportunities in cardiometabolic diseases.  As a result of NSF Phase 1 STTR support, Kilele Health is now able to pursue full commercialization of a wearable continuous molecular monitor more aggressively for chronic diseases beyond diabetes.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aleksandar Karajic"
