 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are increasing resources for elementary students to learn early concepts for computer science and a need for students to be ready to learn about computer science in later grades. Computational thinking (CT) includes preparation for computer science practices like pattern recognition, abstraction, and testing to solve problems and can be applied to other disciplines. However, elementary schools need support to infuse computational thinking throughout the curriculum and make sure learning experiences for students are coherent, high-quality, and equitable. This project will create tools to support schools and districts in examining their current computational thinking teaching and learning experiences and develop plans for creating new experiences. The research process includes school leaders, teachers, and students to investigate the planning process at different sites and in schools with different levels of experience with computational thinking as part of their curriculum. This project is funded through the CS for All: Research and RPPs program.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Research Strand project will build on prior-work by field testing the CT Integration Framework and self-assessment tool and develop additional resources to support school-wide, coherent integration of computer science with other disciplines in elementary schools. The project will study the planning process and professional development required to support elementary schools in their efforts to integrate CT across subjects and grade levels, making computer science education accessible to all students. The research questions investigate how elementary schools plan for computational thinking integration, as well as teachers and school leaders understanding of computational thinking. The questions also explore students\u2019 access to high-quality computational thinking instruction with attention to groups historically underrepresented in computer science. The project will study the outcomes of the planning process by gathering data about professional development opportunities, student learning, teacher and school leader surveys, and other artifacts of teaching computational thinking. The schools in the project will represent different student populations and different levels of experience implementing computational thinking across multiple grade levels. The long-term goal of this work is to improve the sustainability of computational thinking teaching and to increase student readiness and interest in computational thinking.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
