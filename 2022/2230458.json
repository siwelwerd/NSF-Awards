 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports efforts by the Council of Independent Colleges (CIC) to increase the number of research grants in computer science sought by and awarded to faculty members at small to midsized independent predominantly undergraduate institutions (PUIs). The award supports a series of three workshops targeting faculty members in computer science and related disciplines to write effective and compelling proposals to the National Science Foundation\u2019s (NSF) Computer and Information Science and Engineering Research Initiation Initiative (CRII) and Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) programs.\r\n\r\nThe goals of these workshops are to:\r\n1) Train up to 180 early career faculty members in computer science and related disciplines from predominantly undergraduate institutions (PUIs) to submit competitive proposals to the CAREER and CRII programs.\r\n2) Prepare grants administrators at up to 180 institutions to better collaborate with faculty members in computer science on seeking and managing NSF research grants\u2014and, in the process, strengthen the grant-seeking capacity of these institutions.\r\n3) Increase the number of grants awarded to CIC member institutions in NSF\u2019s CRII and CAREER programs for computer science and related disciplines, with the goal of twenty awarded projects by 2025.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
