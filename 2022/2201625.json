 "awd_abstract_narration": "Training and certifications in engineering technology provide pathways for students to enter the aerospace technician workforce. Currently there is a shortage of qualified technicians for the aerospace industry in Northeast Florida. To be successful in the aerospace workforce, students need to learn skills associated with the design and fabrication of products using lightweight materials. This includes an understanding of the technologies used to create these products such as additive manufacturing, fiber composites fabrication, polymer fabrication, and computer-numerical control in metal working. This project will create a new curriculum within an existing engineering technology degree program that focuses on these skills and techniques. As students complete courses in the program, they will have the opportunity to earn three industry certifications. Students will learn how to use these manufacturing technologies through hands-on training. To increase the number of students in the aerospace technician pipeline, dual enrollment courses will be offered for high school students. Project results and educational resources will be made available through the ATE Central Portal.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to increase the number of qualified aerospace technicians in Northeast Florida. The project will: (1) create a new Advanced Materials Design in Manufacturing track within the current engineering technology degree program, (2)  prepare students to earn at least three industry-recognized credentials in space materials manufacturing, (3) develop a Space Materials Manufacturing Laboratory to help students learn manufacturing techniques, and (4) create a career pathway for secondary students. Using best practices from the Florida Advanced Technological Education Center as well as existing institutional programs, the project team will recruit students from underrepresented groups to broaden participation in the aerospace technical workforce. Professional development for community college instructors and secondary teachers will provide hands-on training on space materials and fabrication techniques. The project will assess student learning gains due to the new curriculum by comparing the results of pre- and post-tests. Student surveys will be used to assess the impact of project activities on students\u2019 sense of belonging and self-efficacy. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
