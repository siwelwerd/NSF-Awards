 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Northwestern University, located in Evanston, IL, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2022-2024. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done using an online instrument. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Additional standard and tailored assessments will be used to refine activities continuously to meet program goals.\r\n\r\nThe program will provide mentored research experiences in the rapidly growing field of synthetic biology, in which new biological systems are constructed to enable biological solutions to important problems. A strong cohort of faculty from departments including Molecular Biosciences, Chemical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Pharmacology, Chemistry, Engineering Science and Applied Mathematics, and Civil and Environmental Engineering will serve as mentors in the program. Students will carry out independent laboratory and/or computational synthetic biology projects such as the development of new biosensors for contaminants in water, self-healing materials, new gene therapy delivery mechanisms, and more. Concurrently, students will participate in a carefully designed curriculum to expose them to a variety of laboratory techniques as well as the skills necessary for success in their future STEM careers, including ethics, responsible conduct of research, communication and networking. Activities include seminars, workshops, teas with faculty, and field trips to local synthetic biology companies. At the end of the program, students will present their projects and results at a research symposium. A stipend will be provided, along with housing, funds to cover some meals, and a travel allowance. Applications will be accepted at the REU website each year, and reviewed by participating faculty and an admissions committee. More information about the program is available by visiting http://synbreu.northwestern.edu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Tullman-Ercek at ercek@northwestern.edu), co-PI (Dr. Rocklin at grocklin@gmail.com), or the program staff (synbreu@northwestern.edu). This award is supported by the Department of Defense ASSURE Program in partnership with the NSF REU Program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
