 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a symposium, \u201cEnvisioning a Diverse, Inclusive, and Safe Future for Field Biology,\u201d at the 2023 annual meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB). A total of 11 symposium speakers will present on identifying barriers, advocacy, and promoting inclusivity and safety in field settings. The award primarily offsets travel expenses for symposium participants. The symposium will close with a discussion to generate ideas for increasing inclusivity and access to field-based disciplines for scientists with diverse identities. This symposium has three key aims toward promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in field biology: (1) bringing attention to current issues on the topic, (2) facilitating productive dialogue between scholars and scientists, and (3) generating scholarly work on the subject to further the exchange of knowledge in this area. By addressing current issues and new frontiers in field biology safety and inclusivity, this symposium challenges attendees to address their own behavior, find ways to improve institutional policies, and shift the culture of field biology toward a more diverse and inclusive future. Outcomes from this symposium will include a white paper outlining best practices for advancing DEI efforts in field-based STEM disciplines.\r\n \r\nThis award provides support for a symposium focused on promoting DEI in field biology at the annual meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB), held in Austin, TX in January 2023. Symposium speakers include scientists from various backgrounds and experiences in field work; speaker selection spotlights the challenges of field work for diverse scholars and provides a place for facilitated discussion and exploration of solutions to the challenges presented. Specifically, speaker presentations address: (1) barriers to inclusion and access, (2) advocating for accessibility and inclusion in the field, and (3) visions for a more accessible future. The symposium structure will challenge attendees to address their own behavior, find ways to improve institutional policies, and shift the culture of field biology toward a more diverse and inclusive future. The symposium concludes with a \u201cgallery walk\u201d and discussion, moderated by a trained DEI facilitator, to generate ideas for improving field science safety, inclusivity, and access. This project will generate a white paper report, coauthored by symposium organizers and speakers, outlining best practices for advancing DEI efforts in field-based STEM disciplines. Each symposium speaker has also committed to submitting a manuscript for publication in the journal Integrative and Comparative Biology to disseminate results of the symposium.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Animal Behavior and the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics programs in the BIO Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Field Stations program in the BIO Division of Biological Infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Specifically, the topic of &ldquo;field biology&rdquo; is relevant to the broader scientific community, as scientists across many disciplines collect data in locations beyond their laboratories. The &ldquo;field&rdquo; represents a landscape where academia intersects with social and domestic life and presents unique challenges for researchers navigating the boundaries and expectations present there. By addressing current issues and new frontiers in field biology safety and inclusivity, we presented a symposium that challenged attendees to address their own behavior, find ways to improve their institutional policies, and shift the culture of field biology toward a more diverse and inclusive future. Furthermore, our symposium line-up reinforced the promise of diversity in STEM fields by including scientists and scholars representing diverse gender identities, racial/ethnic groups, disability status, career stages, and field-based scientific disciplines. Shortly after the SICB symposium, the PI (Young) and symposium co-organizer (Verble) began working with a team to co-organize a related workshop for the 2023 Organization for Biological Field Stations (OBFS) annual meeting at La Selva Research Station (Heredia, Costa Rica). The scope of this workshop was to address issues of risk and hazard within a safety, inclusion, and diversity framework at field stations and marine labs and develop training and templates for implementing field safety policies at individual field stations. This represented an opportunity to support the goals and increase the impact of the SICB symposium outcomes. The OBFS workshop aligned well with the broader impacts of the original SICB symposium proposal, as well as with NSF&rsquo;s requirements for Safe and Inclusive Working Environments for Off-Campus or Off-site Research (NSF 23-1). The OBFS workshop provided an opportunity to directly address issues of field safety and inclusion with field station directors and staff, as well as time to collaboratively develop and revise institutional policies that promote diversity and inclusion. This workshop had 55 participants representing field stations and marine laboratories in 10 countries and has the potential to have a profound and global impact on diversity and safety in field-based STEM disciplines. Together, the SICB symposium and OBFS workshop produced 11 peer-reviewed papers (published in <em>Integrative and Comparative Biology</em>, Volume 63, Issue 1), a full-day field safety plan training workshop, and a workbook to guide field station staff and principal investigators in developing comprehensive DEI-informed field safety plans.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/14/2024<br>\nModified by: Vanessa&nbsp;K&nbsp;Hilliard Young</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
