 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funds participant support for the 11th and 12th annual Boston University/Keio University/Tsinghua University Workshops, with the 11th Workshop to be held June 27-July 1, 2022, at Boston University, focusing on Geometry and Mathematical Physics. The 2023 workshop will focus on Probability and Statistics. The funding is dedicated to travel and local expenses for advanced graduate students and recent PhDs based at US institutions outside the Boston area. The workshops will provide participants with the opportunity to hear advanced talks in their research fields, to present their own work in a professional setting, and to network with each other and with senior experts. Through their own sources of funding, Keio University and Tsinghua University faculty will bring similar participants to these workshops from Japan and China. As a result, these workshops strengthen research ties between the US, Japanese, and Chinese mathematics and statistics communities.\r\n\r\nThe workshops follow a format in which senior faculty lecture on recent research directions in the morning, and recent PhD recipients and graduate students present their own work in the afternoon. Poster sessions accommodate additional presentations, and each workshop includes a discussion section on open problems in the field and other issues of particular interest for early-career participants, such as career placement. The workshops provide websites with lecture notes and slides from the research presentations, which serve to disseminate these cutting-edge research results to the broad communities. More information can be found at the workshop website http://math.bu.edu/BKT2022.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
