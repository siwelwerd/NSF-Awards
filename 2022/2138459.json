 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nSandwich structures are generally constructed to offer high strength and stiffness. They are used in myriads of applications including airplane, military, thermal insulation, vibration isolation, and automotive industry. However, the core topology becomes a limiting factor for achieving high-performance sandwich structures. Various aspects of core geometry can enhance the mechanical and thermal properties of the sandwich structures. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of such thermal and mechanical property enhancements in structural sandwiches remains unknown. This project seeks to unveil the mechanisms of thermomechanical property enhancement due to the modulation of the interior core architecture. The approach integrates numerical and experimental methods to illustrate the interior core topology and property relationships. Property enhancement of structural sandwiches that are used in a wide range of applications will benefit the national economy. This research involves multiple disciplines including engineering mechanics, materials science, and additive manufacturing. The project will support graduate and undergraduate students and encourage the participation of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering. The outreach component of the project will demonstrate research concepts to high school and middle school students.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to fundamentally understand how structured core lattice architecture improves the mechanical and thermal properties of sandwich structures. Various triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) based core lattice, namely, gyroid, diamond, and primitive core structures will be extensively studied in this project. The research team will perform two tasks: (i) developing three-dimensional finite element method based numerical simulations to predict thermomechanical properties for various core topologies. The studies will identify high stress/ critical sections to optimize parameters including unit cell size and wall thickness for superior performance of different TPMS core structures; and (ii) to experimentally determine the deformation mechanism of TPMS core-based sandwich structures due to multi-mode mechanical loadings at various temperatures. In addition, detailed surface morphology and failure mechanisms will be studied through high resolution scanning electron microscopy. This project will help gain new understandings of thermomechanical behavior-topology relationship in sandwich structures with particular emphasis on various TPMS core lattice architecture.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
