 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is important to bolster the integrity of and trust in U.S. elections.  This project develops methods and software to simplify and reduce the cost of providing strong evidence that reported winners really won--or correcting the results if not. The key statistical tool is a risk-limiting audit (RLA) using a trustworthy paper record of the votes. This project increases the efficiency (reducing the legwork needed to confirm outcomes when outcomes are correct), flexibility (to accommodate constraints imposed by local laws, regulations, and technology), and applicability of RLAs (to accommodate more voting rules and to make it affordable to audit every contest in every election). The project builds and publishes open-source software implementing the improvements and is working with state and local election officials to pilot the methods.\r\n\r\nAn RLA is any procedure with a known maximum chance (the risk limit) of not correcting a reported contest outcome if that outcome is wrong. RLAs correct outcomes by manually tabulating a trustworthy record of the validly cast votes. RLAs can be reduced to multiple instances of a core statistical problem: testing whether the mean of a bounded list of nonnegative numbers is less than or equal to 1/2. This project develops improved methods for sequential and batch-sequential tests of such hypotheses using simple random samples, cluster samples, stratified samples, and Bernoulli samples. The methods involve test statistics that are nonnegative supermartingales under the null. Tests that adapt by \"learning\" the true mean from the sample can improve efficiency substantially, as can adaptive stratified sampling designs that preferentially draw from strata where the null appears to be false--leading to a generalization of the multi-armed bandit problem.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
