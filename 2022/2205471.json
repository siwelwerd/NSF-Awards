 "awd_abstract_narration": "When planning to obtain radio images of the first stars and galaxies in the universe it is crucial that telescope being used is in crisp focus. This can be a timely process, as recently demonstrated by the four months needed for alignment of the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s mirrors.  The alignment of the hundreds of antennas in a modern radio telescope is even more challenging than the alignment of the eighteen segments that compose the James Webb Space Telescope primary mirror. The color-dependent alignment process is called calibration in radio astronomy, and this project will develop, and freely share, a new precision alignment process. The team at the University of Washington specializes in such precision calibration work and has developed the mathematics and statistics needed for a new much improved calibration algorithm. During this project the effectiveness of this new approach will be tested by making radio observations of the first stars. This project will engage community-college transfer students to participate in this research.  \r\n\r\nPrecision calibration of interferometric radio data has been greatly advanced by the requirements of 21 cm Cosmology observations. A fundamentally new Bayesian calibration approach referred to as unified calibration allows the uncertainties to be quantified and generates associated optimal calibrations. This advance has the potential to greatly enhance both standard radio calibration and 21 cm Cosmology observations. This project looks to produce two forms of unified calibration. One will be written in python and leverage the community around pyuvdata to produce a flexible and robust implementation. This implementation will enable the community to explore the best calibration parametrizations and to apply the approaches to a wide variety of interferometric data. The second implementation will focus on precision and speed for Epoch of Reionization power spectrum analysis and enable deep data-driven explorations of calibration that will inform the most effective parametrizations of instrument and sky models and their associated uncertainties. The project will also improve the retention rate of community college transfer students at universities through their better engagement in research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
