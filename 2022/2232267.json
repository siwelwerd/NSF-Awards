 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technological developments are bringing more sophisticated automation and greater levels of machine autonomy to the global airspace (National Research Council, 2014). Despite this, the human operator remains indispensable to the aviation system, filling roles that include pilot, air traffic controller, aircraft dispatcher, and aircraft and air navigation system maintenance worker. These roles evolve with technology but are not displaced by it. Aviation systems must therefore be built to accommodate the operators\u2019 abilities and limitations. Effective human-machine integration translates fundamental knowledge of human performance into sound design choices.  \r\n\r\nThe International Symposium on Aviation Psychology (ISAP) is a biennial meeting that convenes scientists, operators, and research sponsors to bridge the gap between basic perceptual/cognitive science and applications in aviation system design. At the same time, ISAP recognizes the need to foster exchange of basic knowledge and insights across domains of application. It welcomes all basic and applied research into the role of humans in human-machine systems that supports generalizations to or from aerospace psychology. The 22nd ISAP, to be hosted by the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, NY, will present cutting-edge research on human cognition and performance within sociotechnical systems, foster collaboration between researchers, engineers, and aviation operational personnel, both from the civilian and the military sectors, and envision design solutions that match aviation technology to human capabilities. The NSF support will enable the construction of an affordable, high-quality program that will draw diverse and broadly interdisciplinary groups of prominent researchers, students, and aviation practitioners representing the academic, industry, and government sectors from around the world with the common goal of ensuring a safe and efficient air transportation system.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
