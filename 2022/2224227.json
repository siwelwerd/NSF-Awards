STARS Computing Corps, a CISE Broadening Participation in Computing Alliance, will support two research community meetings: the CISE EWF Principal Investigator (PI) Meeting and the CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site New PI Workshop.  Both convenings will provide opportunities for the principal investigators  of projects funded by CISE EWF programs to share their research outcomes, promising practices, and lessons learned.\r\n\r\nBoth the CISE EWF PI meeting and the REU Site New PI workshop will be large events for the Foundation and their respective community, bringing together PIs with representatives from government, academia, and non-profit. For each event, there is a pressing need to meticulously plan and organize agendas, venue and hybrid/remote conference logistics. This grant provides funding for the venue and logistics, including conference registration, audio visual, and meeting space for the hybrid CISE EWF PI meeting. It will also support the remote logistics of the CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site New PI Workshop.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
