The foundations of a new partnership between the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) and the McDonald Observatory of the University of Texas at Austin will be established. This program will provide students from a Hispanic-Serving Institution (UTRGV) the opportunity to carry out research at a world-class astronomical observatory. The McDonald Observatory is home to eight professional telescopes including the 11-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET), the largest optical telescope in North America. The Observatory is located in the Davis Mountains of West Texas, which offer some of the darkest night skies in the 48 contiguous states.\r\n\r\nUTRGV students will be trained in optical photometry and spectroscopy with state-of-the-art astronomical instrumentation at McDonald Observatory. Using the McDonald telescopes to take imaging data for a few selected nearby galaxies, students will make a systematic study to determine the nova rate of nearby galaxies, a rate which is currently poorly constrained. Novae are particularly luminous astronomical transient events and nova rates of nearby galaxies give an insight on stellar evolution and in particular stellar population synthesis models.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

During these two trips, a total of 16 students <br />received hands-on training in operating professional telescopes. With the 2.1 m and 2.7 m telescopes, <br />students observed Galactic cataclysmic variables and other variable sources. With the 0.9 m telescope, <br />students carried out astrophotography of exceptional quality. During our journeys to the <br />observatory, students participated in different daytime educational activities which included a visit <br />to the Hobby Eberly Telescope and its mirror lab, a tour of the Coude Spectrograph of the 2.7 m telescope, <br />and a visit to the NRAO VLBA station in Fort Davis. The Coude Spectrograph is a unique instrument, students <br />can walk into the spectrograph and observe its different components. Students were also trained in <br />standard data reduction techniques based on PyRAF and Astropy. <br /><br />The two cohorts of students were energized by each trip to West Texas, and all students returned home <br />with a new appreciation for observational astronomy, and science in general. This program propelled <br />six undergraduate and master&rsquo;s students to continue their graduate education. <br /><br />This award also provided support for students to present posters based on the data they obtained at <br />the McDonald Observatory at several meetings of the American Astronomical Society (Seattle 2023, New Orleans 2024, Madison 2024) and one meeting of the American Institute of Physics (Las Vegas 2023).</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/31/2024<br>\nModified by: Juan&nbsp;P&nbsp;Madrid</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2219165/2219165_10798094_1722291482488_ringnebula_cutout--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2219165/2219165_10798094_1722291482488_ringnebula_cutout--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Ring Nebula\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2219165/2219165_10798094_1722291482488_ringnebula_cutout--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Ring Nebula\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image of the Ring Nebula obtained with the 0.9 m telescope.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Constantine Poulos</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Juan&nbsp;P&nbsp;Madrid\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ring Nebula</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2219165/2219165_10798094_1722291811443_juliachavezmcdonald--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2219165/2219165_10798094_1722291811443_juliachavezmcdonald--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"UTRGV physics major Julia Chavez\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2219165/2219165_10798094_1722291811443_juliachavezmcdonald--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"UTRGV physics major Julia Chavez\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UTRGV physics major Julia Chavez stands in front of the landmark building of the McDonald observatory housing the Otto Struve telescope (2.1 m).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Constantine Poulos</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Juan&nbsp;P&nbsp;Madrid\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UTRGV physics major Julia Chavez</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2219165/2219165_10798094_1722291348648_fortdavis_nrao_vlba--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2219165/2219165_10798094_1722291348648_fortdavis_nrao_vlba--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"At the Fort Davis VLBA antenna\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2219165/2219165_10798094_1722291348648_fortdavis_nrao_vlba--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"At the Fort Davis VLBA antenna\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Visit to the Fort Davis VLBA station (NRAO).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Constantine Poulos</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Juan&nbsp;P&nbsp;Madrid\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">At the Fort Davis VLBA antenna</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2219165/2219165_10798094_1722291696698_RudyMoralesAPSmeetingLasVegas--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2219165/2219165_10798094_1722291696698_RudyMoralesAPSmeetingLasVegas--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Rudy Morales at the American Physical Society Meeting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2219165/2219165_10798094_1722291696698_RudyMoralesAPSmeetingLasVegas--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Rudy Morales at the American Physical Society Meeting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UTRGV student Rudy Morales presents a poster at the American Physical Society meeting in Las Vegas (March 2023).
