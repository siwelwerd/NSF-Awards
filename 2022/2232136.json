 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference on \"Emerging Trends in Variational Models of Materials\" will be held June 26-30, 2023, at the Centre de Recherches Math\u00e9matiques (CRM) affiliated with the University of Montreal. The meeting represents the convergence of many of the world's top researchers in the mathematical analysis of materials science. Furthering our understanding of how materials behave when exposed to external stresses, magnetic or electric fields, or temperature variation allows us to design more effective devices and to adapt to the natural fluctuations found in nature. For mathematicians, this translates into formulating and analyzing more and more sophisticated mathematical models. The speakers and attendees of this meeting have international reputations as highly effective investigators of this realm of science. This conference will provide a rich experience for young researchers at the graduate and post-doctoral level in the United States who through NSF funding can attend and interact with leading scientists.\r\n\r\nThe wide-ranging topics under investigation at this conference include pattern formation, phase transitions, dynamics, and control of soft matter systems, including liquid crystals, ferromagnets, and superconductors. Also featuring prominently will be topics related to self-assembly and collective behavior of many-particle interactions such as biological swarms and granular media, along with image processing and dissipative flows. These problems, originating from physics, materials science, and biology, constantly reshape contemporary mathematical research. In addition to applied mathematicians, there will be talks presented by a leading experimentalist in liquid crystal research and top experts in scientific computation as it applies to materials science. Information about the event can be found at  https://sites.google.com/view/varmodmat23/home\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
