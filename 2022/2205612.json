 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Broadening Participation Research (BPR) in STEM Education projects supports the development, implementation, and study of new theory-driven models and innovations related to the participation and success of underrepresented groups in STEM undergraduate education. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, as well as improve the recruitment, retention, and success of underrepresented groups in STEM education and the workforce. This project at Saint Augustine\u2019s University seeks to develop a career readiness framework and study its impact on HBCU STEM students' career perspectives. The research team plans to translate empirical results into best practices that inform the development of STEM curricula, classroom practices, and extracurricular activities that enhance STEM students' occupational attainment. \r\n\r\nThe research project's objective is to study the impact of a STEM career development intervention at Saint Augustine's University. The project team will utilize a non-equivalent group design and non-parametric statistics to examine the effects of participation in a STEM career readiness program on vocational perspectives and career training outcomes. The research team hypothesizes that involvement in workforce preparation activities will positively enhance career development outcomes among HBCU STEM students. The quasi-experimental research project aligns with the National Science Foundation's goals to promote best practices and synthesize empirical evidence to improve STEM education and employment experiences among underrepresented populations. It is anticipated that the proposed efforts may enhance the understanding and facilitate the dismantling of barriers as experience by HBCU STEM students pursuing STEM career opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
