 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Program will support 10 students at the University of Tennessee. A diverse group of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science faculty will mentor students in a 10 week research project which address the ways in which devices and electronics at the micrometer and smaller scale impact modern technology and provides advances in environmental science, physics, agriculture, space exploration, and biology.  Students will use state of the art software and instrumentation to develop theories and design and implement microelectronics and sensor systems.  In addition to independent projects, students will be exposed to potential career pathways enabled by advanced degrees and through professional development and mentorship improve their competency in oral and written communication, research strategies, the scientific method, and critical thinking. This program seeks to increase student participation in graduate school by offering opportunities to students from many backgrounds.  \r\n\r\nThe REU site in Microelectronics and Sensor Systems addresses the question of \u201chow information can be efficiently processed from measured signals.\" Under the guidance of their faculty mentors students will perform research tasks towards developing new devices and circuit architectures to new computing architectures and algorithms that spans the academic fields of computer engineering, quantum computing, energy and power, space exploration, and biotechnology. Students will gain knowledge and experience in the basic essentials of microelectronics, research methodologies, working in teams, communication, and multidisciplinary research methods. Students will be exposed to potential career pathways with advanced degrees including national labs, academia, industry, and intellectual property with attention being paid to the challenges faced by deaf and hard of hearing students. The REU contribution to Microelectronics and Sensor Systems will be invaluable and could impact faculty mentors by leading to unique microelectronics design approach and unique sensor system solutions and improved communication methodologies. The REU will have long term impact on the cohort through post-completion mentoring relationships and peer-peer cohort relationships.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
