The award supports travel expenses for approximately 20 graduate students. The conference program includes many of the research topics central to theoretical and experimental Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics and Quantum Information Science. The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical physics acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology. \r\n\r\nThe conference includes a special \u201cGraduate Student Symposium\u201d on the day prior to the main meeting.  The symposium provides students with a pedagogical introduction to important themes in current research. The subject for 2022 will be \u201cTextbook AMO platforms for Fundamental Science and Technology.\u201d  In addition to the symposium, the conference offers an opportunity for students to present their research results and to interact with more senior scientists from the United States and abroad. Travel support is provided only for students enrolled in US universities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
