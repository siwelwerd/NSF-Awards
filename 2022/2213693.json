 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is in addressing the rapidly growing need in manufacturing smaller devices to support miniaturization of systems and products. An increasing number of devices require smaller designs and incorporate miniaturized components. The demand for miniaturized devices is often unfulfilled due to the high costs associated with traditional manufacturing methods and the lack of high-precision three dimensional (3D) printing technology. The proposed micro- and nanoscale 3D printing technology is expected to better enable miniaturization and the design and manufacture of small components in different industries as diverse as medicine, microelectronics, optics, biosensors, aerospace, defense, and high-frequency communications. The graduate student will be simultaneously exposed to cutting-edge research and entrepreneurial endeavors, which provides a strong training opportunity for a future innovator and/or entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project seeks to develop and demonstrate the scale-up of laser-based micro and nanoscale printing process with the goal of commercializing the technology. An ultrafast laser can be used to non-equilibrium heat nanocrystals, trigger the spontaneous and localized fusion of the nanocrystals, and 3D print micro/nanostructures. In this project, use-inspired and applied research will be performed to increase the printing rate by orders of magnitude such that the technique can be further evaluated against the various needs of potential customers and basic scientists alike. The proposed micro/nano 3D printer will allow direct metal printing with submicron resolution and multi-material printing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
