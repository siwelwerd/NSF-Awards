The IOOC Support Office will continue to provide project management and meeting support services for the IOOC.\r\n\r\nInteragency collaboration is essential to achieve ocean science and technology priorities and, in particular, for planning and coordination of an ocean observation system. The IOOC support office provides administrative assistance to the federal agencies on all of the IOOS planning activities. An IOOC that is able to effectively support these goals will make meaningful contributions to broader societal goals related to climate, maritime operations, natural hazards, national security, public health, ecosystems, and natural resources.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
