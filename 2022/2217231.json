 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will provide travel support for junior investigators to attend the 49th annual meeting of the Orthopedic Research Society (ORS) Musculoskeletal (MSK) Biology Workshop in Snowbird, Utah, 23-27 July 2022. These workshops promote interdisciplinary communication between biologists, engineers, and clinicians in the area of musculoskeletal biology, biomechanics and mechanobiology; stimulate interactions among investigators in all levels in their careers; builds for-life scientific networks; emphasize active participation of junior faculty and students; and are unique in that discussion time equals or exceeds time allotted for presentations. The focus of the workshop is broad and highly multidisciplinary. Sessions address significant current problems, limitations, potential solutions, and approaches applicable to both basic science and clinical. The attendance of this Workshop represents a significant number of students, young investigators, women, and underrepresented minorities. Partnership with the ORS provides maximum visibility through broadcast emails and links on the ORS website, where abstracts will be posted. \r\n\r\nThe scientific theme of the 2022 workshop is \u201cMusculoskeletal immunology and mechanotransduction: biology and disease from stem to senescent cells.\u201d The program consists of the \u201cRemodeling in Bone\u201d (RIB) plenary lecture entitled \u201cThe biology of bone and muscle wasting\u201d; two  career development sessions; and six scientific sessions: (1) Major Methodologies: Optical imaging of musculoskeletal tissues; (2) Problems in Orthopaedics: Autologous-autogenous treatments for musculoskeletal disease; (3) Interactions between the immune system and musculoskeletal tissues; (4) Mechanobiology of musculoskeletal tissues; (5) Osteocytes: From biology to pathophysiology; and (6) Problems in Aging: Development of senolytic therapies for musculoskeletal disorders. The specific objectives of the MSK workshops are (1) Work toward a multidisciplinary basic and clinical synthesis of molecular, cellular, tissue, and biomechanical processes that lead to understand the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal diseases, prevention, and treatment. (2) Apply basic science concepts to clinical problems and develop dialogue between basic and clinical investigators. (3) Identify problems and formulate solutions to musculoskeletal diseases. (4) Provide a forum for students and junior investigators training to interact among themselves and with more senior scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
