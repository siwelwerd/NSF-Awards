 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded through the NSF Directorate for Engineering Germination program, which seeks to foster the development of pedagogical approaches to increase the ability of academic researchers to formulate research questions and ideas with potentially transformative outcomes. In this Expansion project, Northeastern University and the Right Question Institute (RQI) will partner to create rQnet, the Research Question Network, a networked community of researchers and higher education leaders trained to improve formulation of research questions in pursuit of societally relevant, high-impact research. The Question Formulation Technique (QFT) will be disseminated nationally through rQnet. This project will also address a critical gap in learning science through creation and validation of a rubric for evaluating research questions. Successful development of rQnet has the potential to play a pivotally important role in training scientists to ask paradigm-shifting research questions. Broader impacts hinge on the fact that improved research questions should increase academic researchers\u2019 abilities to address societal challenges.\r\n \r\nThe project will create the Research Question Network \u2013 rQnet - to serve as a networked community of researchers and higher education leaders trained to improve formulation of research questions in pursuit of societally relevant, high-impact research. The QFT has previously been piloted for use in training graduate students to improve their question-asking skills. This project focuses on expanding QFT uptake by establishing rQnet as a mechanism for capacity building through national virtual workshops and Early Adopter Researchers (EARs) who serve as research leaders in their own institutions. Importantly, this project proposes to develop and refine a rubric to identify and assess high-impact research questions. During the funding period, this research program will 1) create a rubric for evaluating research questions; 2) validate this rubric with metrics to characterize high impact research questions; 3) demonstrate effective strategies to implement the QFT in teaching, research and mentorship; 4) assess indicators of institutionalization of the QFT; and 5) articulate best-practices to implement the QFT in research communities. Successful instantiation of rQnet could establish a sustainable living network.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
