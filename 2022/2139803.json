 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to enable innovations in wireless Internet-of-Things (IoT), wearable sensors, and wearable products. Portable electric energy is a key component in many technological devices. This project advances a transformative technology that integrates energy capture, storage, and delivery into a single device to advance the portability and utility of small electronic devices. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to overcome two key challenges faced in wireless IoT, wearable, and electronic products: battery life, and the costly inconvenience of frequently replacing batteries. The project integrates advanced solar cell, supercapacitor, and power electronic technologies into a single unit (Supercell) easily connected to electronic loads. Design priorities include physical flexibility, wide operating temperature range, heat management, ultra-low Equivalent Series Resistance and leakage, high energy storage capacity, and good operating efficiency. The approach pairs solar cell and supercapacitor technologies to work together, each complementing the other. Advantages include size, weight, and installed lifetime cost, when compared with single-use batteries, or with discrete solar cells. The proposed work will accelerate adoption of IoT, wearable, and electronic technologies by offering a better source of energy than field-replaceable batteries or discrete solar cells.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
