 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid proliferation of mobile technologies, manifested by a boom in smart phones and mobile video, along with the emergence of new verticals such as industrial IoT and autonomous vehicles, placed high demand on the communications infrastructure and motivated the introduction of 5G cellular systems. Compared to its 4G/LTE predecessor, 5G systems promise to deliver orders of magnitude higher data rates, significantly lower end-to-end latency, much denser connectivity, seamless coverage, high reliability, and longer battery lifetime. Facilitating these performance gains are advances on multiple fronts, most notably access to new swaths of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum. In addition to opening new spectrum above 24 GHz for 5G systems, the FCC and other regulatory bodies also created new opportunities at mid-bands below 7 GHz (\u201cbeachfront spectrum\u201d). These bands exhibit favorable propagation characteristics that enable wide-area coverage at high data rates.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on addressing coexistence challenges over three recently available mid-bands: the C-band (3.7-3.98 GHz), the CBRS band (3.55-3.7 GHz), and the recently unlicensed 6 GHz bands (5.925-7.125 GHz).  These bands have been only recently allocated for commercial wireless systems, which will have to coexist on these bands with a wide variety of incumbents, including Navy radar in 3.55\u20133.7 GHz CBRS band, point-to-point microwave links and passive radioastronomy receivers (e.g., the Methanol line) in the 6 GHz bands, and adjacent radar altimeters in the 4.2\u20134.4 GHz band. The proposed research agenda includes three thrusts. In the first thrust, the PIs will focus on coexistence and interference mitigation in the C-band. Despite extensive media coverage of the potential of 5G interference onto radar altimeters, there is a lack of rigorous, unbiased analyses and measurement of such interference in realistic operational scenarios. The PIs will accurately characterize C-band interference and establish the conditions under which it may occur. Novel machine learning (ML) techniques will be developed for real-time detection of interference and mitigation of its impact by adapting the 5G transmission parameters. The second thrust focuses on coexistence and interference mitigation in the CBRS band, particularly secondary coexistence between Tier 3 (GAA) users, which is quickly emerging as a bottleneck to efficient use of the band. Protocol-based and ML-based solutions will be explored. The third thrust focuses on coexistence in the unlicensed 6 GHz bands, where ML-based protocol classification designs will be explored to allow a given device to detect the underlying protocols of other devices and adapt its parameters accordingly. The proposed solutions will be evaluated via simulations and field measurements. These solutions are expected to have broader applicability beyond the specific studied bands. Research outcomes from this project will be shared with industry and will be provided to the FCC as case studies to facilitate subsequent policy making in other bands. The proposed research will be fully integrated into the educational plan by incorporating its outcomes in newly designed and existing courses as well as training undergraduate and graduate students via mentoring, participation in test-bed development, and special projects. The project contains a detailed plan to broaden participation of underrepresented groups via various channels established in the past years.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
