 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless networks are undergoing a radical transformation with the aim to provide the critical information infrastructure for the 21st century and foster new economic opportunities, innovation and many emerging applications. To facilitate this,  there is a focus on new spectrum in the millimeter-wave frequency range that has the ability to support ultra-high data rates with low latency needed for applications in automation, robotics and cyber-physical systems, smart health, and autonomous vehicles and systems. The spectrum can also support wireless backhaul links to bridge the last mile connectivity, and provide broadband wireless access---the importance of which is clearly highlighted during the Covid-19 pandemic.  However, these connectivity links are prone to physical channel disruptions including blockages and channel propagation variations, and therefore not resilient. The proposal involves a multi-disciplinary approach across three different research groups towards addressing these problems and ensuring resilience and scalability in such networks. The proposed concept of smart reflecting surfaces aims to enable dynamic and on-demand control of wireless channels to create favorable transmission allowing robust wireless connectivity in mobile mmWave WLANs. The success of this project can enable the next-generation, ubiquitous, and low-cost mmWave wireless access, including flexible deployment of wireless backhauls addressing the last-mile connectivity, satellite communication, and intelligent wireless sensing systems for smart cities and cyber-physical systems. The project will address the need for developing US-centric capabilities in semiconductors and wireless technology, through training of students across the undergraduate and the PhD program in a rigorous multi-disciplinary research effort. \r\n\r\nThis project, mmRISC, builds Resilient mmWave Networks via Distributed In-Surface Computing.  We investigate mmWave, multi-band hybrid surfaces with embedded custom-silicon ICs that provide on-surface signal amplification and computing abilities for multi-user localization, tracking and ambient sensing.  Our proposed surfaces enable resilient and reconfigurable distributed networks that maintain low latency, energy and spectral efficiency. We pursue a holistic, cross-system research approach focusing on scalable, spectrally-agile, low-power, and low-cost hybrid surfaces operable across multiple mmWave bands with controlled amplification. We will also focus on embedded computing for on-surface sensing, and resilient network architectures supporting such smart surfaces allowing capacity optimization. Through cross-layer design approaches, our proposed work will inform the architecture of NextG surface-assisted wireless networks for the future.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
