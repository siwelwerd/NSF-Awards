 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the current paradigm of galaxy formation vast streams of cool, primordial gas fall into the centers of dark matter halos. As the flows continue and density increases, the first generation of stars form in what will eventually become a young galaxy. The subsequent interaction between the cool inflowing gas and the hot ejected gas gives rise to an extensive and dynamic gaseous \"atmosphere\" surrounding it, called the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The CGM is important for what it can tell us about both the formation and continuing evolution of galaxies. The researchers will lead a coordinated program combining state-of-the-art hydrodynamical galaxy simulations with data from new multi-wavelength surveys capable of probing the CGM to advance our understanding of the physical processes that have shaped it over cosmic time. The award will also support a graduate student as well as a program designed to recruit, train, mentor, and support undergraduate STEM students in CGM research. \r\n\r\nThis award will advance the understanding of the physics of gaseous halos as we enter the era of multi- wavelength astronomical surveys. Specifically, the researchers will (1) place novel, deep-learning constraints on CGM physics by interpreting deep eROSITA x-ray data in light of the state-of-the-art Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) results, (2) explore the use of radio 21 cm mapping and fast radio bursts (FRBs) as probes of CGM over cosmic time, and (3) develop a machine learning technique to estimate the mass of galaxy groups by combining Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and eROSITA images. As the CGM becomes increasingly mapped both panchromatically and tomographically, statistical forecasts from ongoing, state-of-the-art cosmological simulation projects are necessary to place rigorous constraints on CGM processes that drive galaxy evolution. The researchers will also develop useful community tools that can be used to maximize the scientific returns of upcoming multi-wavelength astronomical surveys.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
