 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts overall employment of aircraft and avionics equipment mechanics and technicians to grow 11 percent from 2020 to 2030, faster than the average for all occupations. About 14,400 openings for aircraft and avionics equipment mechanics and technicians are projected each year, on average, over the decade. The Institute for Public Policy and Economic Development found that Northeastern Pennsylvania\u2019s demographic challenges slow down economic growth in the region while estimating there to be a regional need for aviation mechanics. Johnson College will develop and implement a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved Aviation Technology associate degree program that successfully recruits and trains students to fill a growing, essential regional and national high technology workforce development needs in the aviation industry.\r\n\r\nProject objectives include the establishment of a working airport-based training laboratory; relationships to engage military veterans who desire training as part of their transition to civilian life; and faculty development activities to remain current with FAA practices. Additional objectives include expansion of College-Industry partnerships to provide training and career guidance; expansion of the College\u2019s dual enrollment program with regional school districts and Career Technology Centers; and development of or participation in middle/high school career awareness activities. The Aviation Technology two-year associate degree program will prepare students to fill a growing number of essential positions in the aviation industry. The curriculum will align with the latest FAA technology and education requirements so that graduates are prepared at the highest level to pass FAA licensure and meet the growing demand for aviation technology mechanics. Students will be recruited from a variety of diverse backgrounds, including prior military service, age, gender, race, cultural, economic, and educational experience. It is expected that the program developed will create a replicable format for institutions looking to create a similar program and meet their own regional workforce development needs. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
