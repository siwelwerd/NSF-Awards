 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is in significant improvement of artificial intelligence (AI) systems by acceleration of the model creation, training, and operation using modern quantum computers. The project's outcomes can stimulate advances in chemistry, create new materials and new drugs, improve manufacturing and retail, reduce risks in high-tech, exploration and mission planning, and improve decision-making in arenas such as the public sector, banking, and healthcare. The project will nurture a new generation of entrepreneurs and scientists who can move easily between disciplines as varied as engineering, physics, computer science, and high-performance simulations.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop an AI-building software platform that enables training the models \u201con the fly\u201d on fast-evolving and fast-growing datasets. This will significantly improve their prediction and classification functions, reducing training time on large datasets by ten-fold. With the quantum-accelerated AI, a significant part of decision-making tasks can be automated to reduce human errors, thereby reducing mission failure risks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
