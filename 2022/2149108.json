 "awd_abstract_narration": "Respiratory illnesses, like those caused by viruses like COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV, are among the leading causes of death for American citizens, especially for those in older and younger age groups, and for immunocompromised individuals. Global spread of these viruses continues to pose a threat in the United States; therefore, it is important to understand how they are transmitted in different cultural settings. In addition to the potential public health benefits of this study, it facilitates scientific training of a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students. Public dissemination of findings will also inform community members on the roles of the household and extended family members in transmitting disease, and measures to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses among family and friends.\r\n\r\nThis study is designed to assess how social behavior and environmental conditions interact to affect the transmission of common respiratory viruses and longer-term health impacts of illness in a tropical setting. To do so, the research team is collecting year-round, community-wide data on social networks and symptoms of respiratory illnesses, seasonal biological markers of respiratory infection, and seasonal anthropometric measurements, including height, weight, and upper arm circumference. In-depth interviews are being conducted to gain an understanding of how people think about illness risk. This study tests the theory that humans use behavior to adapt to environmental circumstances, and that they do so in a way that maximizes benefits and minimizes risks associated with the behavior. This may help to inform future public health policy on how best to minimize transmission of respiratory viruses.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
