 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of software tools to model the progressive failure of composite structures used in aerospace applications.  Failure modeling of composites is a highly complex multiscale problem, and the result of the analysis implies a trade between fidelity and speed depending on the scale at which damage is simulated and the size of the structure.  The proposed technology provides a general framework to analyze combinations of layups and loading scenarios using a common experimental material characterization plan.  The technology incorporates the effect of manufacturing on the performance of the structure. By advancing simulation tools, composite structures may be designed with more confidence and safety as well as in a much shorter time frame compared to current procedures. The availability of reliable and fast predictive tools may enable and accelerate the use of lightweight composite materials, which in turn may lead to better fuel efficiency of commercial and military aircraft.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a finite element algorithm that models explicitly the dominating damage modes observable at the subcomponent level of a composite structure such as delamination, macroscopic matrix cracking, and splitting. This analysis level is the most time consuming and expensive in the certification process of a structure. The proposed technology may be used to accelerate the certification process without compromising accuracy by identifying a set of fundamental model features, characterizable from basic coupon tests, that must be incorporated to predict the progressive failure of composite structures in a wide range of layups and loading scenarios. In tests of the proposed technology, errors within 5% of experimental data in blind predictions are typically achieved in computational times of one order of magnitude faster than current methods. In addition, the analysis also considers the effects of the curing process, which affects the residual stresses and deformations in the composite. These factors influence mechanical properties such as stiffness and strength. The proposed technology integrates curing and failure modeling within the same finite element software.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

To date, the feasibility of the technology has been proven and it is currently under development. Through 100 informational interviews with potential customers, commercialization opportunities were explored in 4 sectors of the aerospace field, namely commercial aviation, military aviation, space, and advanced air mobility. Among the interviewees were members of several stakeholder groups including end users, decision makers, influencers, recommenders, saboteurs, and competitors. The key insights gathered are as follows. Advanced material models similar to the technology proposed are currently being used by aircraft OEMs (commercial and military) at different points in the design process to make informed decisions about their testing campaigns. The results obtained from the models currently available are typically unsatisfactory, and the interest in better alternatives was expressed by most of the interviewees. Different stakeholders are currently working on addressing this need including the same aircraft OEMs, regulating authorities like the FAA, government agencies like NASA and the Air Force, and software providers. This insight validated the value proposition of our technology. Regarding the magnitude of the pain that our technology addresses, not much urgency was identified. Although our technology could provide significant gains to our customers, different design methodologies are available, which reduces the sense of urgency from the stakeholders involved in developing and implementing improved models. To succeed in commercializing our technology, close collaboration with regulating authorities is required as well as demonstrations to our customers to gain acceptance of the community. The data gathered from the interviews suggested that this process could take multiple years before our technology can become profitable. The best early adopter remained unclear, however, the interview data implied that corporate culture was the most influential factor. Small companies where decisions could be made rapidly were potential candidates. Another group of potential candidates were startups where design procedures were still not rigidly established, and where new methods could be implemented relatively easily. Beyond early adoption, other product-market fits identified were the use of our software by material manufacturers to demonstrate the capabilities of their products, and the use of our software by aircraft OEMs to develop virtual allowables. The group&rsquo;s current plan of action after I-Corps is to continue developing the technology and raising awareness about it in the community for a couple of years. Commercialization paths will be reevaluated after this period based on the results achieved at that point.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/27/2023<br>\nModified by: Moderage Anthony&nbsp;M&nbsp;Waas</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
