 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2022, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Over centuries, humans have selectively bred domestic dogs for appearance and behavioral characteristics. This practice has reduced genetic variance between breeds and resulted in a \u201cnatural experiment,\u201d providing current researchers with a controlled opportunity for understanding the role of domestication on behavior and identifying its physiological underpinnings. Fields such as genetics and neuroscience, which have traditionally used animals such as mice and rats in controlled laboratory settings, are now looking to dogs for answers because of their long history of co-evolution with humans. By investigating the gene-brain-behavior link in dogs, who live in the same environment as humans, there is greater potential to understand how physiology and behavior are shaped by living in real-world environments. \r\n\r\nDue to very relaxed negative selection and very strong positive selection, certain traits can become common in domesticated species. The presence of these deleterious traits has been demonstrated in dog behavior and cognition using behavioral, genetic, and brain imaging. Uniting insights from these separate lines of research in a multimethod project, the Fellow will investigate gene-brain-behavior phenotypes of aggression, combining behavior assessment surveys with neuroimaging (MRI) and genetic analysis. The Fellow will investigate if systematic differences in the morphology and connectivity of aggression-related brain regions, genetic variation, and individual life histories play a role in aggressive phenotypes in dogs. An initial sample of pet dogs from the community will participate in behavior prescreening with C-BARQ (established behavior assessment instrument). Dogs that score in the top 20% and bottom 20% of aggression scales will participate in additional screening for adverse life experiences, provide cheek swabs for genotyping individuals, and be invited for an MRI scan in the lab. The Fellow will be trained in MRI analyses to investigate differences between and interactions among brain phenotypes linked to genotype, brain phenotype, and early adverse experiences. This work will shed light on the gene-brain-environment interactions that govern aggression, which is important for improving human-animal relationships, and has implications for understanding human mental health and social wellbeing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Tthough dogs have been selected for cooperation with humans, behavioral issues such as reactivity harm dog-human relationships and contribute to publish health concerns. My postdoctoral project investigated the complex interaction of genes and environmental factors shaping aggressive and fearful behavior in domestic dogs to understand the heritable and experiential risks that contribute to undesirable behavior. The scientific aims of my project were 1) to understand the association of early life adversity (events before 6 months) with aggressive and fearful behavior in adult dogs; 2) determine which genetic markers were systematically present in dogs with increased aggressive and fearful behavior, and how early life adversity interacted with genetic predispositions for expressing certain behaviors; 3) and finally to identify brain phenotypes of fearful and aggressive behavior resulting from trauma using non-invasive structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to map both white and grey matter structures in the brain. I used a multimethod approach to gather the data required to meet these aims: 1) detailed dog life histories and behavioral profiles through surveying a large representative sample of English-speaking dog guardians; 2) DNA and genotyping a subset sample of single breed dogs using at-home cheek swab kits sent through mail service; 3) MRI scans of a subset of the genotyped sample, collecting detailed structural images as well as resting state BOLD data to examine inter-region connectivity. Using this mixed methods approach to studying various levels of organism-environment interaction gave me the opportunity to shed light on biological determinants of complex social behavior and provide theoretical insights to the fields of genetics, developmental neuroscience, psychiatry, and animal welfare.</p>\r\n<p>PROJECT OUTCOMES: The results of the first aim have been completed and are currently under review with a peer-reviewed scientific journal. The data that contributed to Aim 1 includes over 4,000 responses from English-speaking dog guardians. They completed detailed surveys about their dog&rsquo;s life histories and current behavioral profiles. In Figure 1, you can see that dogs with a history of early life adversity (negative events during the first 6 months) scored higher on scales of &nbsp;severe aggressive and fearful behavior than dogs who did not experience adversity, <em>or</em> dogs who experienced adversity at later stages of life (Figure 2). Further, I found that adversity appears to differentially impact dogs from different breed ancestries, with some breeds showing a greater impact of adversity on fear and aggression, while others appear relatively unaffected (Figure 3a-b). These findings parallel what has been observed in observational human studies of institutionalized and abused children, and also in laboratory studies of non-human primates that experience resource scarcity and abuse. This is the first study to show such a relationship between early life adversity and adult behavior in a non-primate species living in their natural environment. Building on these results, in the ongoing aims of the study, I follow up on the heritable components of fearful and aggressive behavior by completing a sample of &gt;1k genotyped single breed dogs. Of these, ~80 dogs will participate in a non-invasive MRI scan at Harvard. Together, the genetic and neural correlates of aggression and fear will help to identify the biological causal mechanisms social behavior as it develops under natural ecological conditions. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This design and socially relevant subject of this project made it possible to connect with a broad community of stake holders, including dog guardians, dog trainers &amp; behaviorists, veterinarians, behavioral scientists and researchers, and university students. Over the course of the project, I mentored three undergraduate students in scientific skills (data analysis, open science tools, scientific writing), supporting their independent research projects and research training. I also trained three lab scientists on database management and DNA data collection in my host scientist&rsquo;s lab, including historically under represented groups in STEM. Through participant recruitment, I built a large community of dog guardians and professionals that were interested in understanding the causes of their pet&rsquo;s behavior. Working with behaviorists and other researchers, I organized and led 4 virtual seminars for the general public to learn about the impact of experience on dog behavior, improve recognition of fear and aggressive behaviors, and more generally for people to engage with science-based evidence about dog behavior and cognition with the aim of improving human-dog relationships. I used the award to apply for and present two data driven talks at scientific conferences in the second year of the award. To broaden participation in STEM within my immediate academic community, I organized mentorship panels for early career researchers to learn about funding applications, organized and led conference workshops on Divesity, Equity, and Inclusion in STEM, and organized social events at Harvard to rebuild community among postdoctoral scholars in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/13/2025<br>\nModified by: Julia&nbsp;H&nbsp;Espinosa Grossmann</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209046/2209046_10839129_1736763936289_breedxadversity_10n_aggr--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209046/2209046_10839129_1736763936289_breedxadversity_10n_aggr--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 3a\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209046/2209046_10839129_1736763936289_breedxadversity_10n_aggr--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 3a\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Average aggression by breed and history of adversity.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Julia Espinosa</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Julia&nbsp;H&nbsp;Espinosa Grossmann\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3a</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209046/2209046_10839129_1736763601316_lifex_fig1--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209046/2209046_10839129_1736763601316_lifex_fig1--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209046/2209046_10839129_1736763601316_lifex_fig1--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Average perceived aggression and fear scores by adverse early life adversity.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Julia Espinosa</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Julia&nbsp;H&nbsp;Espinosa Grossmann\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209046/2209046_10839129_1736763690303_lifex1_fig2_age_adversity--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209046/2209046_10839129_1736763690303_lifex1_fig2_age_adversity--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209046/2209046_10839129_1736763690303_lifex1_fig2_age_adversity--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mean behavior score by age group at time of adversity.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Julia Espinosa</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Julia&nbsp;H&nbsp;Espinosa Grossmann\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209046/2209046_10839129_1736763982764_breedxadversity_10n_fear--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209046/2209046_10839129_1736763982764_breedxadversity_10n_fear--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Figure 3b\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2209046/2209046_10839129_1736763982764_breedxadversity_10n_fear--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Figure 3b\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Average fear by breed and history of adversity.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Julia Espinosa</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Julia&nbsp;H&nbsp;Espinosa Grossmann\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3b</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
