 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to address an unmet need in the regenerative medicine and therapeutic cell market. If successful, the proposed technology will boost cell and drug manufacturing for biomedical applications. The proposed program will provide training opportunities in the areas of engineering of functional soft materials and entrepreneurial skills for the commercialization and development of startups. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project aims at developing robust and cost-efficient cell culture dish inserts with thermos-responsive coatings for enzyme-free detachment of high-quality cultured cells with no enzyme contaminations nor damage to the cells and their environment. The product will secure improved efficiency and productivity of cell manufacturing along with the high quality of the products for end-user applications. The research program is designed to address knowledge gaps and technical barriers through the (i) development of a cost-efficient scalable method for the fabrication of micro-structured thermo-responsive thin-film coatings; (ii) identification of the optimal dimensions of the adhesive and repulsive patterns to enable adhesion, proliferation and enzyme-free harvesting of different cell lines; and (iii) study of the cultured and detached cells to assess potential cell damage for optimization of the adhesion level.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
