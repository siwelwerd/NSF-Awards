 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) will introduce a free pilot webinar series in Astronomy, conducted exclusively in Spanish, targeting Hispanic/Latino audiences in the USA and beyond. The webinars will feature successful scholars from the professional astronomical community. The focus of the presentations will be aspects of recent developments in astronomy and space science, introducing scientific data and data analysis techniques and providing avenues for research using citizen science data.  By making astronomical content available to Spanish-speaking audiences, the program will promote broader involvement in citizen science (through the AAVSO\u2019s existing on-line portals) and encourage the entry of young members of this underrepresented group into STEM careers.\r\n\r\nAstronomy has always triggered human imagination and is considered a gateway to increase familiarity with scientific terms, build an understanding of data acquisition and analysis techniques, bring the public closer with scientists, and foster trust and positive relationships with science.  The webinar series aims to introduce basic science concepts, provide opportunities for casual discussions and interactions between presenters and participants, introduce strong positive role models, and increase trust in the scientific method among members of minority communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
