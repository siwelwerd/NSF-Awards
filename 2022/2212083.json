 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-quality water is needed for sustaining all life on Earth. Different types of pollution, however, can reduce water quality and harm the plants, animals, and people that depend on water to live. Specifically, recent wildfires across the U.S. may reduce water quality in several ways. For example, ash from wildfires can end up in lakes and rivers, potentially harming aquatic organisms and drinking water supplies. In this project, a group of researchers will study water quality of northern Minnesota lakes after the 2021 Greenwood Fire. This wildfire burned a large part of Superior National Forest in fall 2021, including areas near 28 lakes. The researchers expect that after spring snowmelt or rain, ash and large pieces of burned plants will wash into these lakes and reduce water quality. They will visit lakes five times from spring to late summer of 2022 to document any water quality changes following the Greenwood Fire. Results of this study will help water managers in Minnesota and elsewhere predict how water quality in lakes and reservoirs may change after future wildfires. This project will also help people who live near lakes understand how the water activities they care about, such as fishing and boating, may be affected by future wildfires.\r\n\r\nAlthough wildfire activity is increasing across the U.S. and concern is mounting over fire effects on water resources, few studies have documented fire effects on lake ecosystems. At 10844 ha in size, the 2021 Greenwood Fire in Superior National Forest was the largest lightning-caused Minnesota wildfire in 10 years and covered all or parts of 28 lake watersheds through October 2021. This project assembled an integrative group of aquatic ecosystem, landscape, and fire ecologists to study the physical, chemical, and biological responses of northern Minnesota lakes to the Greenwood Fire. The researchers hypothesized that (1) lake responses will vary proportionally to the percent watershed burned and between drainage vs. isolated lakes and (2) post-fire temporal trajectories will vary according to major hydrologic events (e.g., snowmelt, precipitation). Both hypotheses are being tested using Bayesian approaches (i.e., information theoretic modeling and model choice procedures). Approximately 15 lakes are being sampled each in (1) burned and (2) unburned control watersheds beginning after spring snowmelt, a critical time for the delivery of nutrients and materials from the burned landscape to lakes, and throughout summer 2022.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

While wildfires are most commonly associated with the Western US, the Midwestern US has a long history of wildfires, including in lake-dense, northern forested regions of the Upper Great Lakes. Wildfire frequency and severity are increasing as a consequence of changing climate. Therefore, wildfires may represent an increasingly important disturbance to northern forested lakes in the future. This project sought to better understand how lakes in this area respond to wildfires by studying a population of 30 lakes (15 in burned watersheds, 15 in unburned watersheds) located in or nearby the 2021 Greenwood Fire burn area (10844 hectares), a lightning-caused wildfire near Isabella, MN. Study lakes were selected to represent a range of wildfire burn size and severity (for example, 1% to 91% of watershed burned).

Previous wildfire-aquatic ecosystem research has largely been conducted on streams and rivers in the western US, but lakes in the Midwestern US may not show similar responses due to differences in geology, hydrology, climate, and vegetation. Our study's combination of location (Midwestern US), large scale (number of lakes), and sampling frequency (monthly from late spring to early fall), as well as our inclusion of lakes in watersheds ranging from minimally burned to nearly fully burned made it unique. To implement our study design, we sampled 30 lakes (15 in burned watersheds, 15 in unburned watersheds), which represents the largest study of lake responses to a single wildfire in North America. Further, we sampled lakes monthly during the ice-free season to investigate how wildfires affected seasonal water quality patterns in lakes; previous studies typically sampled lakes once during the summer.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Our research findings showed that lakes in burned watersheds had consistently greater amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon and were considerably murkier compared to control lakes (unburned watersheds). Interestingly, increases in nutrients did not lead to increases in algae production, potentially due to increased water murkiness and insufficient light. In lakes with burned watersheds, total phosphorus was the only variable that significantly increased with increasing percent of the watershed vegetation undergoing a high severity burn. Increases in total nitrogen and carbon responded most to the percent of the shoreline that burned, but the response was not significant and leveled off. Lake and landscape factors generally explained more variability in the water quality responses than burn severity, but the fire variable with the strongest explanatory power was the percent of the shoreline vegetation that experienced a high severity burn. Monthly differences between burned and unburned lakes persisted for most of the water quality variables except pH, which was similar across all lakes.

Our findings showed what fire, lake, and landscape characteristics cause the biggest lake water quality responses to fire, which can help lake managers target limited funding to lakes most at risk of water quality degradation. By showing that high-severity burns near lake shorelines had the greatest impacts on lakes, our findings will help forest managers improve fire risk mitigation activities, such as the placement of prescribed burns and mechanical thinning, to reduce the impacts of wildfires or prescribed burns on waterbodies. For workforce development, this project directly supported two early-career scientists (PhD degrees) and one nontraditional undergraduate student (Bachelor's degree), helping to retain them in the sciences as they explored permanent career pathways.
