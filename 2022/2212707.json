 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions increases the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover may prove to be a model for similar engagement at other small community colleges.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to validate the physical prototypes of optimal tripolar concentric ring electrode (CRE) configuration on real life phantom model data. Moreover, it seeks to investigate possible adverse effects of salt bridge shortening between the recording surfaces of physical CREs on Laplacian estimation. Study of this emerging, noninvasive electrophysiological diagnostic technology has the potential to advance knowledge and improve the accuracy of Laplacian estimation in systems such as electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrocardiograms (EKG). The project aims to improve the diagnostic yield of signals using optimal CREs for conditions that disproportionately affect Native American populations. Furthermore, the project strengthens the capacity of the Mathematics for Engineering Applications lab at Din\u00e9 College, while providing opportunities for tribal college students to participate in cutting edge collaborative international research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
