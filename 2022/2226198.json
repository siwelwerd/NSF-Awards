The IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) is a premier international conference for presenting the research results, problem solutions, and insights on new challenges in dependability and security of computer systems and networks. The 2022 edition of the conference will be organized around a number of thematic areas of emphasis, which include recently emerged or emerging areas such as Autonomous Systems, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Distributed ledgers and Blockchain, and Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The conference will provide various opportunities for student submission and participation. These opportunities range from full-length conference and workshop papers to medium-length preliminary contributions considered by the Student Forum to brief descriptions of early stage research in the Fast Abstracts category.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide the attendance opportunity to students in U.S. universities, who otherwise might not be able to attend the conference, in particular students from underrepresented groups, undergraduate and graduate students who are attending the conference for the first time, and students who might not have a paper or presentation at the conference. The broader impacts of the project is primarily through the education students will receive from attending the technical sessions of DSN, mentoring that they will receive through the Student Forum activities, and networking opportunities they will receive through numerous different conference activities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
