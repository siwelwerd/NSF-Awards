 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seafloor geodesy measures motion of the earth underwater. Current technology receives data from seafloor instruments by sending and receiving signals from the sea surface to the seafloor and back. However, this method has a depth limitation of ~3000 m which greatly limits where instruments can be deployed. This project investigates using a different technique which can be used in deep water that only requires the signals to travel from the sea surface to the seafloor. Broader impacts include support for a graduate student and partnering with an engineering company.\r\n\r\nSeafloor geodesy remains a frontier area of geophysics. Suboceanic measurements of position and displacement made with high precision over long spatial and long temporal baselines hold the key to a variety of scientific questions of first-order importance, such as the long-term behavior of subduction zones and other areas where earthquakes nucleate. This project tests a new approach to GNSS-Acoustic seafloor geodesy using data from a field experiment acquired in 5225 m deep water. The system of GNSS-Acoustic geodesy (1) directly positions a material point (a Continuous Deep Ocean Geodetic sensor called C-DOG) on the seafloor (rather than a virtual point), (2) uses a one-way acoustic travel-time measurement by the seafloor beacon and (3) a non-stationary surface vessel that can survey multiple C-DOGs in rapid succession. (4) It furthermore leverages recent developments in GNSS processing techniques for precise point positioning of the acoustic transducer, (5) it is capable of remaining dormant on the seafloor for an extended time, and (6) it corrects for bias due to sound velocity errors as part of the inversion strategy. Workforce development includes a graduate student who will interact closely with engineering partners to develop the necessary expertise. Educational materials for outreach developed during this project will be widely shared to the scientific community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
