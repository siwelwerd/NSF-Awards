 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Yamabe Memorial Symposium will be held from Friday through Sunday, September 30 to October 2, 2022, at the School of Mathematics, on the Minneapolis campus of the University of Minnesota. This year is the tenth anniversary of the Yamabe program. Each biennium, the geometry group of the School of Mathematics decides on a theme for the Symposium. The theme for this year is \"Geometry and Analysis\". The principal speakers will be Ailana Fraser, University of British Columbia (Canada), Pengfei Guan, McGill University (Canada), Fernando Marques, Princeton University, Andre Neves, University of Chicago, Antoine Song, University of California at Berkeley, Song Sun, University of California at Berkeley, Brian White, Stanford University, and Sumio Yamada, Gakushuin University (Japan). Together they represent a wide spectrum of topics in geometric analysis.  The purpose of this Symposium is to bring to our participants a deeper understanding of some recent discoveries in Geometric Analysis, and to bring to the fore new issues that have arisen in light of them. This will help participants and researchers gain a wider perspective of these new developments and bridge increasingly disparate research trends.\r\n\r\nThe symposium will cover topics including construction and analysis of minimal submanifolds, singularity and stability for mean curvature flow, Ricci flow and Einstein equation in general relativity. These topics are of central importance in geometric analysis and have recently experienced breakthroughs and significant progress. As the list of invited speakers shows, all these areas will be well-covered by our Symposium and leading experts in the world. The Yamabe Symposium webpage: https://cse.umn.edu/math/yamabe-memorial-symposium-2022\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
