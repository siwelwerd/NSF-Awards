Weigel\r\n\r\nProposal number: 2208949\r\n\r\nResearch title: Linking diversity and environmental change to the productivity of snow algal communities\r\n\r\nSponsoring scientist(s) and host institution(s): Dr. Robin Kodner (Western Washington University) and Dr. Jodi Young (University of Washington-Seattle)\r\n\r\nThis action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2022, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Microscopic algae called snow algae thrive in snow-covered alpine ecosystems worldwide. Snow algae cells have red pigments, and blooms of snow algae darken the snow surface and accelerate snowmelt. Snow-covered mountains around the world provide a critical supply of water, so understanding how snow algae impact snowmelt is important for global water security. This research aims to determine how the productivity (photosynthesis rates) and biomass of snow algae communities in alpine ecosystems is linked to their genetic and life cycle diversity, and to environmental factors such as temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. This research will allow scientists to determine the impacts of climate change on snow algal communities and predict how snow algae will impact snowmelt in alpine ecosystems in the future. Key components of this project will include engagement with local communities through the Living Snow Project, and broadening participation in science through mentorship of students underrepresented in the sciences.\r\n\r\nThis research will determine how multiple components of biodiversity (interspecific and life cycle diversity), together with environmental conditions (seasonality, temperature, light, and carbon dioxide levels), shape the primary productivity and biomass of snow algae communities. This project has three primary aims: (1) quantify variation in genetic diversity (using amplicon sequencing of taxonomic genes), life cycle diversity (using microscopy), and phenotypic traits of snow algal communities (photophysiology, carbon fixation and cellular respiration rates) across the spring and summer growing season at field sites in the North Cascades of Washington; (2) test the physiological and transcriptional responses of snow algal communities to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in the lab; and (3) synthesize results from aims 1 and 2 to parameterize predictive models of snow algae impacts to bioalbedo and snowmelt in alpine ecosystems. The fellow will gain invaluable training in alpine ecosystem fieldwork techniques, transcriptomic sequencing, data analysis, and inclusive pedagogical practices. Throughout the fellowship period, the fellow will broaden participation in science by mentoring students underrepresented in the sciences on snow algae research projects, and by peer education to other postdoctoral researchers through a zoom-based inclusive pedagogy in STEM workshop.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
