 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded through the NSF Directorate for Engineering Germination program, which seeks to foster the development of pedagogical approaches to increase the ability of academic researchers to formulate research questions and ideas with potentially transformative outcomes. The goal of this Germination Expansion project is to develop a Center for Urban Transformations at Georgia State University expanding on an educational model piloted at Arizona State University for graduate research and training in urban sustainability (funded through NSF award 1444755). The pilot successfully equipped graduate students to collaborate across disciplinary lines (for example, ecology, engineering, and social science) and with decision-makers, practitioners, and civic groups to produce novel research agendas, datasets, and questions to solve complex urban problems. Under the aegis of this Expansion award, the Center for Urban Transformations at Georgia State University aims to scale the pilot model to the Greater Atlanta region through strategic partnerships with research-practice networks. Likely broader impacts of the proposed center are inherent in its focus on sustainable cities, with a centering on resilience for under-resourced communities. As a minority-serving institution, Georgia State University is well-positioned to provide a valuable experience to students.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to foster the transformative capacities needed to co-produce innovative research agendas that advance urban sustainability transformations. The central research question of the project is: What capacities are needed for students, researchers, practitioners, and community partners to co-produce innovative research agendas that advance sustainability transformations? In addressing this research question the project seeks to: increase the motivation and capacity of the next generation of urban systems scientists to conduct, apply, and communicate transdisciplinary transformations research; promote co-learning and collaboration among graduate students, scientists, and decision-makers to advance urban social-ecological-technological systems transformations; and ensure the participation of broad groups of people in the knowledge-implementation cycle. These goals will be approached through a set of activities, including: (1) an Urban Transformations Studio interdisciplinary core course for graduate students in a range of fields related to urban sustainability; (2) an Urban Transformations Summer School designed to enhance science communication and interdisciplinary research skills; (3) an Atlanta Transformative Leader Series to foster relationships with community stakeholders and thought leaders; (4) mentorship and support through involvement in research-practitioner networks; and (5) Knowledge Mobilization Showcase events. Evaluation of progress on the goals, objectives, activities, and student capacities will be guided by the Value-Engaged, Educative evaluation approach.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
