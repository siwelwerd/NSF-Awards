 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n \r\nWith this CAREER project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the principal investigator, Prof. Fangyuan Tian, and her research group study two-dimensional conductive and semiconductive porous crystalline thin films. Electrically conductive materials have led a range of applications in energy storage, chemical sensing, electrocatalysis, and fuel cells. It is critically important to explore the electron transfer behaviors observed on these ultrathin porous materials and this project provides an in-depth understanding of surface and interface chemistry of two-dimensional conductive and semiconductive materials, which aligns well with the mission of NSF to promote the progress of fundamental science. The research is beneficial to advancing the semiconductor industry. Moreover, this project integrates research and education to train undergraduate students in surface sciences and educates high school students about materials chemistry. Another educational effort is to promote diversity in materials science by providing research opportunities to students from diverse cultural backgrounds. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n  \r\nThe CAREER project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, investigates the electron transfer processes in two-dimensional conductive and semiconductive crystalline coordination networks, including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and their composites with conductive polymers. Specifically, research activities include the study of lateral and vertical charge transport, as well as electron transfer between conductive polymer and its host MOF/COF material in a heterogeneous structure. The project enhances the scientific understanding of surface and interface interactions between crystalline coordination networks and semiconductors with combined analytical methodology and materials design, thereby guiding future crystalline coordination-based device design. By providing early research opportunities to a diverse cohort of undergraduate students at the California State University Long Beach, the project targets on increasing diversity in materials science. Meanwhile, outreach activities involve local high school students and the general public by improving scientific awareness and interest in materials research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
