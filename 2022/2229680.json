 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investments in aquatic species around the world support the annual production of more than 110 million tons of food, the direct employment of more than 60 million people, and the support many types of scientific research including medicine. Valuable genetic lines of aquatic species, such as fast-growing species for fish farmers (aquaculture) or endangered species, must be preserved in a way that can be recovered years, decades, or even longer after they are collected. Cryopreservation (freezing) is a valuable tool to protect these resources, but it must be done in a standardized way with devices and approaches that can fit all budgets. A new approach is to use 3D printing and consumer-level electronics to produce devices that users can manufacture themselves. This \u201copen hardware\u201d needs to be made accessible to new user and maker communities. This project will develop an Open Hardware Ecosystems in which users can access files to make devices and help shape future developments. This Ecosystem will allow laboratories, stock centers, academic institutions, aquaculture producers, and conservation agencies to preserve and distribute genetic material for future development.  \r\n\r\nOpen-source hardware offers tremendous opportunities for science to expand participation and improve outcomes. This project seeks to establish germplasm repositories to safeguard the genetic resources of aquatic species. A strategy based on the principles of business development is needed for creation of an efficient Open Hardware Ecosystem to avoid pitfalls and to generate opportunities by identifying time, resources, costs, and personnel needed to maintain and use the Ecosystem. Useful platforms should be able to distribute fabrication files for open hardware, as well as the associated user manuals, data collection worksheets, database structures, training curriculum, and other information needed to produce repository-ready samples. This project will be user-based and will focus on the process for recruitment leading to community development, and the progression through user to maker to developer. This planning stage will include a determination of the size and characteristics of the target sectors, while identifying opportunities for expansion. Process mapping approaches will be used to develop simulation modeling and analysis of the proposed platform. These options will allow for open distribution of technology, while maintaining protection of intellectual property.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
