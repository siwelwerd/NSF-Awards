 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many bacteria use a nanosyringe on their surface to inject proteins into host cells to facilitate infection.\r\nThese injected proteins, called effectors, are normally folded into specific three-dimensional structures\r\nrequired to carry out their functions. However, they need to be mechanically unfolded by the syringe\r\nmachinery to be secreted through the needle and into the host where they refold to their normal structure.\r\nTo facilitate their secretion, effector proteins are easy to unfold mechanically\u2014they are mechanically\r\nlabile\u2014whereas proteins that are mechanically robust cannot be secreted. However, what makes proteins\r\nmechanically labile or robust is poorly understood. This project addresses this knowledge gap. A carefully\r\nchosen set of model proteins and state of the art experimental and computational tools will be used to\r\nelucidate what makes a protein secretable by bacterial nanosyringes. This will define a fundamental\r\nbacterial infection mechanism and may also allow future engineering of the system to inject proteins of\r\ninterest into host cells. More generally, the project will advance the field by helping define the rules for\r\nprotein mechanical stability. The combination of biophysical and computational approaches provides an\r\noutstanding cross-training opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students in the physical and\r\nbiological sciences.\r\n\r\nHow protein mechanical stability is encoded\u2014how unfolding by mechanical force is modulated by\r\nsequence and structure\u2014is poorly understood. This project addresses this knowledge gap by examining\r\nproteins secreted by the bacterial Type III Secretion System (TTSS), called effectors, as model systems.\r\nThe TTSS mechanically unfolds and secretes its effectors while other proteins stall in the secretion\r\napparatus. The PI\u2019s team discovered that TTSS effectors are mechanically labile compared to their noneffector\r\nhomologs. In this project, they explore the hypothesis that effectors have evolved to be\r\nmechanically labile, so they can be unfolded by a weak TTSS unfoldase, explaining their extreme sequence\r\ndivergence from their non-effector homologs. The system provides a naturally occurring model to\r\nunderstand how mechanical stability is modulated by sequence. The collaborative approach combines: (i)\r\na high-precision single molecule assay to determine mechanical properties of TTSS effectors and their noneffector\r\nhomologs; (ii) steered molecular dynamics simulations to provide a theoretical model of the\r\nmechanisms of differential mechanical stability within a conserved fold; and (iii) live-cell imaging to test\r\nthe effect of different mechanical stabilities in TTSS secretion. This provides a comprehensive, quantitative,\r\nand physiologically validated model for how mechanical stability is encoded and it impact on TTSS\r\nsecretion.\r\n\r\nThis research is funded by the Molecular Biophysics program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate of Biological Sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
