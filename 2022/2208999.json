 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2022, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Global environmental change widely affects a broad number of species, from individual cells to entire ecosystems. Environmental disruptions such as warming, drought, and nutrient pollution can trigger changes in both plants and microbes. However, how global change might alter the interaction between these different life forms is not well studied. To fill that knowledge gap, this project will test new theory on plant-microbe associations and use the information from this study to make better predictions about ecosystems experiencing climate change. To broaden participation in science, the fellow will lead workshops to empower diverse communities with the tools to understand global change. \r\n\r\nThe fellow will investigate microbial yield, resource acquisition, stress tolerance, and interaction traits in a tradeoff framework as a Rule of Life, and will apply this tradeoff theory to predict microbial assembly and function across several plant-associated environmental contexts at the Loma Ridge Global Change Experiment in Irvine, CA. Using a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches, the research will address whether trait tradeoffs exist at the microbial genomic level, if microbiome assembly is determined by environmental selection on traits, and if life history strategies predict ecological functioning in a changing environment. This type of molecular-theoretical-modeling approach could be applied across systems from humans to soil microbiomes. This approach can reveal how underlying microbial genomic information and ecology relate to microbiome assembly and function. This integrated research bridges theory, molecular data, and ecosystem processes to generate results with practical value for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Training objectives include building expertise in global change ecology, developing computational and theoretical skills, and practicing inclusive teaching and mentoring.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This fellowship supported advanced training in bioinformatics, analytical techniques, and mathematical approaches to studying microbial functions in the rhizosphere, particularly under drought conditions. Drought and altered precipitation, which are expected to intensify with global change, act as strong selective forces that drive changes within plant and microbial communities respectively. However, the higher-order interaction between plant-microbiome are rarely considered in how ecosystems will respond to these environmental pressures. This research aimed to determine whether generalizable, trait-based tradeoff principles govern plant-microbe associations under stressors and whether these principles can predict system-wide responses to such stressors. Specifically, the fellow investigated whether microbial traits related to growth, stress tolerance, resource acquisition, and biotic interactions influence microbiome assembly and function in the dominant pan-rhizosphere of multiple plant species within the Loma Ridge Global Change Experiment (Irvine, CA). These findings enhance our understanding of how plant-microbial interactions support ecosystem resilience under global change and offer a framework for applying these principles across diverse ecosystems, including agriculture.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Intellectual merit outcomes</em></p>\r\n<p>During the award period, the fellow developed expertise in analyzing and integrating large, complex metagenomic datasets using advanced modeling, theoretical frameworks, and statistical approaches applied to soil and rhizosphere microbial communities. These cutting-edge skills in bioinformatics and microbiome science were applied to two research projects that resulted in at least three first-authored publications. &nbsp;Using modeling and bioinformatics, Favela leveraged microorganisms and genomes previously isolated from Loma Ridge to construct genome-scale metabolic models. These models demonstrated that interactions among genes within a genome drive the emergence of phenotypes that could not be predicted by single genes or phylogeny alone. This finding suggested that trade-offs exist within microbial genomes, emerging through complex polygenic interactions.</p>\r\n<p>The research also revealed that plants, long-term water treatments, and ecosystem types collectively influenced the assembly of rhizosphere microbial communities in the Loma Ridge ecosystem. Herbaceous shrubs were observed to recruit distinct microbial communities under drought conditions, whereas woody plants did not exhibit this behavior. Notably, these shifts in rhizosphere microbiome assembly appeared to be species-specific, with individual drought-stressed plant species recruiting unique microbial strains. The researchers began assembling the genomes of these microbial strains enriched in the drought-stressed pan-rhizosphere to identify underlying microbial traits driving the observed species-specific patterns. These findings hold potential for identifying novel microbial genomic targets to enhance drought tolerance and support conservation efforts.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, the researchers investigated the legacy effects of rhizosphere microbial community changes on a subsequent successional population of a single <em>Bromus</em> species. The findings indicated that the legacy of a rhizosphere microbiome influenced its interactions with future plant communities. Specifically, whether a plant originated from ambient or long-term drought conditions interacted with plant species to shape future plant fitness. Perennial heterospecific plants appeared to have the most beneficial microbial effects on subsequent plant generations. This interaction has the potential to inform models of plant community dynamics under future global change scenarios or be applied in agroecological systems.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Broader impacts outcomes</em></p>\r\n<p>As a first-generation scientist, the fellowship provided Favela with the opportunity and time to expand his \"omics\" and modeling toolkit while diversifying his academic network. At UC Irvine, he established connections with numerous microbial ecologists, many of whom later secured positions in national and international laboratories as well as private and public academic institutions across the United States. This network led to tangible research collaborations, presentations at national conferences, and is expected to result in significant research outcomes. During the fellowship period, these collaborations facilitated Favela's invitations to deliver seminars, apply for external funding, and propose sessions at national conferences.</p>\r\n<p>Favela conducted collaborative work to examine how K&ndash;12 planetary health education varies across the United States and to identify the factors driving these disparities. The findings revealed that industry and politics significantly influence the quality of education. Aligned with his interest in public engagement in science, the fellowship enabled him to explore areas beyond research that he might not have pursued otherwise. Notably, he participated in the NSF-funded Science Communication Identity Project through the University of Rhode Island and Michigan State University. This experience highlighted the importance of communicating science to the general public and greatly enhanced his skills in this area.</p>\r\n<p>Within UC Irvine, Favela mentored two undergraduate students, two graduate students, and one lab manager. He guided them in learning about research, developing scientific writing skills, and refining their graduate-level grant proposals.
