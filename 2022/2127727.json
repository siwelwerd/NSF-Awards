 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce injury, property damage, operating costs, and liability in the built and natural environments.  Excessive snow, rain, wind and seismic activity create high structural loads that can lead to the collapse of buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure.  These loads can also destabilize geographical features such as water impoundments and hillsides.  Increasingly extreme climate impacts and aging infrastructure make these situations more common and unpredictable.  Weather events affect 5.9 million commercial buildings and 137,000 schools in the US.  Of the 600,000 highway bridges in the US, 45,000 are structurally deficient. Landslides result in $3.5 billion in repair costs due to physical damage and result in 25 to 50 deaths annually.  Since small structural movements often precede damage and even catastrophic failure, the ability to detect and monitor these motions at key locations and deliver warnings to any user with a cell phone or computer is of great societal benefit.  This project will lead to the development of a low cost, rapidly installed, and intuitive wireless system to measure and record movements within broad categories of infrastructure and geographic features.  Early warning of structural movements helps mitigate risk, prevent unnecessary damage, initiate evacuations, and keep occupants safe.\r\n\r\n \r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I team will construct a series of sensors that measure commercial rooftop movement like that seen from high snow and wind loading.  Existing disaster forecasting systems are expensive, operationally complex, and/or provide limited data.  The sensors in this project will use precision radio receivers to create 3 axis centimeter-accurate movement data.  Sensors report movements to an application server where an algorithm will be created to analyze and display geo-located data.  When necessary, alerts are sent to users via Short Message System (SMS, i.e., text) and email, indicating the location and severity of the problem.  A key metric to success will be the ability for the sensors to operate accurately on structures such as metal-decked rooftops which can create challenges for radio frequency devices.  A compact design is necessary for commercial viability and to create a stable enclosure with low aerodynamic drag. Therefore, a novel hybrid energy supply will perform additional system functions and will be evaluated for output efficiency.  To reduce battery demands, algorithms will be developed instructing units to remain in \u201cpower saving mode\u201d during periods of low activity then switch into \u201chigh fidelity mode\u201d when motion is detected or expected, such as during storms or geological events.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Loads typically present themselves as large amounts of snow, water, slush, or a combination of all three accumulating on rooftops. Also, machinery or other structures placed on rooftops can induce significant and dangerous loading. \n\nTen sensors were fabricated and put into use on a test building and operated over an extended periods of time under varying conditions typical of commercial buildings.  All test objectives were met or exceeded. The tests were designed to evaluate the sensor\u2019s ability to: produce stabile and accurate data for over 30 days, operate in an RF-rich environment with potential obstructions to signals such as walls and large equipment.  Software algorithms were developed to detect when periods of low activity exist to reduce sampling and data transmission rates and therefor energy usage.  When high load activity is detected or relevant NWS reports were present, sensors switched into high fidelity mode and transmitted data more frequently.\n\nThe system has gained significant interest from commercial customers and resellers.  The next step is to secure Phase II funding, complete development and begin production.  Early applications will include box stores and warehouses.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/11/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher Dundorf"
