Despite the benefits of AI, organizations face challenges and risks when applying AI technologies. Our 2023 NSF Workshop on AI Governance reflects academic efforts to move forward AI governance. AI refers to systems that use data and computational techniques to make decisions or to assist people in making decisions, as defined in our workshop's Keynote presentation (Sonderling, Kelley, and Casimir, 2022). In the context of employment decisions, AI has often been used in hiring workers, such as formulating job ads, identifying candidates, screening resumes, automating interviews, scoring assessments, and analyzing work samples. In addition to hiring, many organizations use AI to facilitate continuous measurement and evaluation of employees. In this case, human managers share agency with algorithms to track, measure, sort, evaluate, and rank the performance and behavior of employees to make real-time recommendations for improving outcomes. In the context of professional decisions, AI has been widely used to facilitate the production and delivery of services and products. For example, many hospitals and clinics use AI for cancer diagnosis and treatment recommendations. In the realm of public health, AI has been used for health promotion, health protection, service delivery, and public health surveillance.</p>\n<p>In response to the risks and challenges associated with AI use/application, there are emerging legislation and regulatory activities in the United States to support the governance of AI technologies, especially in the realm of employment decisions. For example, in 2021, EEOC launched &ldquo;Artificial Intelligence and Algorithmic Fairness Initiative&rdquo;<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a>, including issuing technical assistance to guide algorithmic fairness and the use of AI in employment decisions, identifying promising practices, holding listening sessions with key stakeholders about algorithmic tools and their employment ramifications, and gathering information about the adoption, design, and impact of hiring and other employment-related technologies. In 2022, EEOC published a technical assistance document regarding &ldquo;The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Use of Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence to Assess Job Applicants and Employees&rdquo;<a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a>. At the state level, the Illinois Law (820 ILCS 42/) Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act<a href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]</a> requires the employer to notify each applicant before the interview that AI will be used to analyze the interview, explain to the applicant how AI works and what characteristics are being used for the evaluation, obtain consent from the applicant, share videos only with those who have the expertise and technology to conduct the evaluation, destroy the videos within 30 days of a request, collect race and ethnicity for those who are and are not given the opportunity for an in-person interview or who are and are not hired, and file annual report on racial bias. In a similar vein, the NYC AI Bias Law<a href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]</a> requires a bias audit by an independent third party to assess disparate impact. It also requires employers to notify each candidate or employee who resides in New York City that an automated employment decision tool will be used to assess or evaluate the individual.</p>\n<p>In light of these regulatory efforts, two presenters at our 2023 NSF Workshop on AI Governance have covered the legal and administrative governance of AI. The AI legal and regulatory landscape is still in its early stages. Overall, the United States has adopted a light-handed approach to regulating AI (Sonderling and Kelley, 2023). Such an approach calls for organizations to engage in self-regulation, an alternative form of governance where an industry monitors its conduct to improve the marketplace, often when government rules and regulations are lacking (ibid.). Six workshop presenters have covered this topic in the realms of employment and professional decisions. Presenters have also raised several important governance considerations for using AI across contexts, including contingencies of usage, fairness assessment, privacy enhancing technologies, and integrating knowledge across multiple fields.</p>\n<p>Our workshop offers a unique opportunity to integrate knowledge across different fields to advance our knowledge about AI governance. The intellectual merit and broader of impacts of the workshop address the complexity of AI governance and the critical roles played by various stakeholders, including regulators, developers, and users. The white paper developed based on this workshop highlights the importance of advancing both legal and self-regulatory governance in designing, implementing, and revising AI systems that support employment and professional decisions. Moving forward, AI governance can significantly benefit from integrating legal and self-regulatory governance efforts and synthesizing knowledge across disciplines (e.g., computer science, business management, and public health).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sonderling KE, Kelley BJ. 2023.
