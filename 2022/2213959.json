 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to provide an accurate and reliable virtual torque sensing (VTS) technology integrated with truck engines that can help improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions while facilitating a more comfortable gear shift. Improved accuracy of real time engine torque may result in a more appropriate gear selection in transmissions thereby delivering reduced fuel consumption and better knowledge about powertrain operation. As exhaust temperature and emission levels depend on both instantaneous and historical engine speed/torque demands, improved accuracy in real time torque measurement helps to address a significant source of harmful emissions. The proposed device is being designed for heavy and medium truck engines fitted in transportation trucks, off-highway vehicles, military trucks, and other vehicles in the transportation sector. This project also seeks to extend the application of this technique to compressed and liquified- natural gas-fueled and hybrid vehicles. Improved accuracy in real time torque measurement will enable engineers to develop more robust analytical models and methods that will help reduce transmission calibration time, while providing opportunities for engine prognostics by identifying unusual variations in engine parameters.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project aims to develop VTS technology providing real-time analyses of engine torque to facilitate optimal gear shifting and provide engine prognostics for vehicles. The three major objectives of this project are: 1) build a minimum viable product with tested and proven features for different engines, 2) perform real-world, on-road fuel efficiency truck testing using VTS enabled improvements, and 3) develop a commercialization path for marketing and obtaining sensor certifications. Historically, the automotive industry has struggled to obtain and utilize inexpensive, accurate, onboard sensors for engine control applications. Better coordination between a vehicle\u2019s engine and transmission may enable smoother gear shifts and improved fuel economy and vehicle performance. A simple, accurate, and cost-effective torque sensor may improve the efficiency and reliability of engine and transmission control. The VTS accuracy relies upon the ability to extract accurate torque values from harmonic information contained within the engine flywheel speed. In this project, artificial intelligence with a machine learning capability will be utilized for accurate and reliable torque analysis. However, the long-term goal of this project is to expand utilization of instantaneous torque measurement methods to better assist engineers in developing advanced control methods for the rapidly developing vehicle mobility network.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
