 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project improves memory for the elderly.  Memory loss is a major concern of an aging population. The $29 B global memory enhancement market comprises supplements, training software, and drugs, although evidence of efficacy is limited. This project will create a user-friendly sleep headband with audio stimulation to improve memory. The solution will create a new category of non-invasive medical devices to benefit people in clinical, home, and professional settings. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project demonstrates the feasibility of a wireless electroencephalogram (EEG) headband that increases memory consolidation during slow-wave sleep activity at home. Audio stimulation during slow-wave sleep activity using polysomnogram equipment has been previously demonstrated to enhance memory retention by facilitating memory consolidation. The envisioned headband acquires high quality EEG data to sense slow-wave brain wave activity and provide synchronous audio stimulation. The anticipated project outcomes are: a) a wireless sleep headband designed for comfort and usability, b) demonstration of enhanced slow-wave brain activity during sleep, and c) evidence of meaningful improvements to memory retention measured by standard clinical assessments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
