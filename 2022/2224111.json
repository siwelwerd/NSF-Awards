The International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST), being held in Washington, D.C on June 27-30, 2022, is a leading forum for hardware security researchers. This travel grant enables approximately 60 student researchers, especially those from underrepresented groups in computing to attend the symposium in-person. The project's broader significance and importance include professional development for undergraduate and graduate students as well as continued growth of the symposium. Students\u2019 attendance enables them to learn about the latest tools, design methods, architectures, circuits, and novel applications of secure hardware.\r\n\r\nTechnical contributions from previous symposia have covered topics such as: (1) counterfeit detection and avoidance, (2) side channel analysis and fault analysis, (3) hardware architectures for cryptography, and (4) physically unclonable functions (PUFs). The travel grants encourage more students to consider a technical submission, participation in growing hardware demonstration space to a large diverse audience, or even to attend as a means to prepare for a technical submission in future years.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
