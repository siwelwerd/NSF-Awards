The Roundtable is tasked with: 1) exploring critical issues related to protecting US national and economic security; 2) identifying and considering security threats and risks associated with federally funded\r\nresearch and development; 3) identifying effective approaches to communicating threats and risks; 4)sharing best practices for addressing and mitigating the threats and risks; and 5) examining potential near and long-terms responses by stakeholders in the research enterprise to mitigate and address the risks associated with foreign threats.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine organized a two-day Meeting of Experts that was open to public participation on January 25-26, 2023.  The meeting followed up on the recommendation in the 2022 NASEM report ?Protecting U.S. Technological Advantage? related to NSDD-189 on protecting the open research environment. The meeting examined whether now is the time to revisit NSDD-189 and the practical effects of doing so, based on views of the foreign policy, security, scientific, and legislative communities.  The event was formed around four questions: \n\nWhat boundaries should exist between fundamental research that should be undertaken in an open environment and research that should only be pursued in a closed environment?  Should restrictions be limited to classification? \nHow do we protect research that is fundamental, that is not technology focused, and/or requires the use of platforms with clear dual-use implications?\nIf the commercial sector is now the center of platform production, as opposed to the past in which military research preceded commercial deployment, how are we to assess when technology becomes of interest to national security?\nHow might foreign actors react to changes in the U.S. research security policy landscape, given foreign interest in achieving scientific and technological pre-eminence, leadership, or at least parity with the United States?\n\n\nParticipants also received briefings from individuals closely tied to the national security communities to help them understand where research security fits in the broader scope of the international technology competition.\n\nGiven the meeting of experts format, an uncorrected transcript was provided to the National Science Foundation at the conclusion of the event. \n\nAs a follow on from the event, the University of Maryland suggested a closed meeting for senior research officers take place on protecting research in the university environment.  That event, which took place under the National Science, Technology, and Security Roundtable funded by the Department of Defense and National Institutes of Health, took place on March 31, 2023, and featured presentations from Congressional staff and current and former research security professionals from the U.S. government. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cole Donovan"
