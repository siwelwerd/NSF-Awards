 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a manufacturing process innovation that overcomes volume expansion problems of batteries made by conventional manufacturing processes. These expansion problems limit the broad adoption of high performance, safer, naturally abundant, environmentally friendly, and cheaper raw materials for advanced batteries in applications such as modern electric vehicles and powered aircraft.  The proposed project develops a drop-in technology for existing manufacturing infrastructure with the potential to significantly reduce the environmental waste of conventional manufacturing processes.\r\n\r\nThe SBIR Phase I project will investigate the binderless electrode manufacturing using nano-layered coatings deposited using a nozzle free spray coating technique. The technical challenges include contaminated electrodes with filter residues; non-uniform electrode thickness, density, and porosity; poor repeatability; and lengthy filter removal process, inhibiting scale-up of the vacuum filtration method for making binderless electrodes. This project will validate a new ultrasonic spray coating technique for scaling the production of binderless electrodes. The scope of the research includes: designing surfactant removal and homogeneous dispersion of nanocomposite mixture solution subsystems, synthesizing binderless electrodes with the innovation, and characterizing electrode prototypes. The project's tasks (using an iron oxide anode for demonstration) include selecting precursor materials with appropriate morphologies and sizes for effective bonding between nanocomposites and adhesion on current collector; designing binderless electrode structures; computer modeling and simulation to optimize parameters of binderless electrode structure, electrode nanocomposite constituent morphologies and sizes; advancing surfactant removal, homogeneous dispersion, and thermal=pressure subsystems; developing ultrasonic nozzle-less spray coatings to make prototype electrodes; and characterizing the mechanical and electrochemical properties of the binderless electrode prototypes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
