This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the strategies used by the first people to settle such a region.

The results of this study will help illuminate the adaptive processes used by pioneering groups in the Americas and will have relevance to other peopling processes in human history.

Stone tool raw material source representation and procurement patterns, as inferred from macroscopic source analyses and geochemical source analyses, will provide information on landscape familiarity and mobility patterns. Stone tool technological analyses, including tool and projectile point morphology, tool diversity, and tool use diversity, will be used to infer mobility patterns, site activities, and technological strategies meant to mitigate risk, with the assumption that risk minimization strategies will be more pronounced at sites in which people were less familiar with the surrounding landscape. By examining patterns and variation among these six sites, the researchers will be able to investigate the adaptive strategies of populations in a new landscape.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
