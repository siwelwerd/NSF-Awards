 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a platform for chemical sensors based on thin films of functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNT). Functionalized CNT thin films have demonstrated remarkable performance as chemical sensors in applications as varied as diagnostics, food safety, industrial process monitoring, environmental monitoring, national security, and more. The unique combination of small form-factor and impressive performance give CNT sensors the potential to bring chemical sensing to a myriad of use cases, with a combined market of over $13.2 billion projected by 2027, some which are not addressable with current sensing technologies. High-performance alternatives require bulky and expensive lab-based equipment that cannot be adopted by most users. Those chemical sensing solutions that do have suitable form factors lack the performance of CNTs. Moreover, CNT sensors also offer the benefit of being printable, flexible, and operating at room temperature\u2014all of which contribute to a sensor technology platform with the ability to drastically expand the serviceable chemical sensing market. This work will focus on developing solutions to two key technical challenges. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project will focus on demonstrating the feasibility of using high-purity semiconducting CNTs as the basis material for a thin-film sensor platform. Despite the impressive performance and small footprint of CNT sensors, commercialization of these thin films has been slow to non-existent due to two major challenges: First, due to drift \u2013 the tendency of CNT thin-films to degrade over time \u2013 sensors fail after 12\u201324 hours. Given that high-performance CNT sensors require expensive semiconducting CNT materials, such rapid failure is not economically viable. The second major technical pain point is that when transitioned from the lab to real-world applications, thin-film sensors are likely to react with interferents (e.g. humidity, low-molecular-weight compounds, temperature, etc.), resulting in false readings. This proposed work will seek to develop solutions to both technical challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major outcome of this project was progress in the technical development of ANI\u2019s chemical sensing platform and assessment of its commercialization potential through customer discovery.  ANI is working to develop a chemical sensing platform based on the use of disposable thin-film sensor cartridges. Semiconducting carbon nanotubes (s-CNTs) are an ideal material to serve as the basis material for such chemical sensors due to a number of material advantages.  They are semiconducting, printable, mechanically flexible and conformal, can operate under room temperature, and have a high capacity of functionalization.\nThe development of our technology entailed demonstrating the viability of using printed thin-films of s-CNTs as the basis for a chemical sensing platform.  Methods for printing carbon nanotube-based thin-film were established and tested for use in liquid and vapor chemical sensing applications. The detection of several volatile organic vapors was used to compare the performance advantages of high-purity semiconducting carbon nanotubes versus \"raw\" (i.e. as-synthesized) carbon nanotubes.\n\nPhase I saw the development of a variety of techniques to process carbon nanotubes and to fabricate and measure the performance of chemical sensors exposed to a variety of chemicals.  The nature of this platform technology is that there are many possible molecules to potentially test for, so we started with tests of single strand DNA and then tested a variety of organic vapors such as ethanol, methanol, acetone, and isopropanol.  We demonstrated the superior response behavior of semiconducting vs raw carbon nanotubes.  From this work, we learned several processing and characterization techniques that will carry us through towards the development of a real-world prototype sensor.  Phase II technical work will be focused on creating a protype sensor for a specific gas, likely ammonia, which was identified through customer discovery as a potential initial market for our platform technology.  Targeting a specific gas will be a first step to creating a more generally applicable sensor that can be used for a myriad of gases in a mixed gas environment.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/25/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Zachary A Gault"
