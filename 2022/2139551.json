 "awd_abstract_narration": "The world\u2019s aviation industry is moving towards autonomous air mobility and sensing, where new developments in artificial intelligence, energy systems, aerodynamics, structures and materials, advanced manufacturing, and multidisciplinary design are enabling new air vehicle concepts and new ways of using aviation in the daily transport of information, people, and cargo. The Center for Autonomous Air Mobility and Sensing (CAAMS) will produce new fundamental engineering knowledge, will develop new technologies, and will train a new workforce needed by pooling the technical know-how of America\u2019s leading engineering research universities with innovative companies ranging from startups to long-established leaders in the aerospace industry.\r\n\r\nCAAMS research focuses on improving air vehicle performance, sustainability, safety systems, manufacturability, and reliability by integrating research in traditional aerospace fields such as control, aerodynamics, structures and materials, communication, and energy storage with new disciplines including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. Brigham Young University\u2019s contributions to CAAMS include research specializations in GPS-denied and degraded navigation, algorithms for autonomous tracking from unmanned aircraft using electro-optical and infrared cameras, guidance and control of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, multi-vehicle coordination and control, unmanned aircraft traffic management, airborne infrastructure monitoring, and eVTOL aircraft aerodynamic modeling and design optimization.\r\n\r\nAutonomous air mobility and sensing includes a broad range of vehicle concepts, integrated subsystems, supporting infrastructure, traffic management tools, and applications that exploit increasingly autonomous capabilities in aviation. These autonomous systems have the potential to improve safety and reliability, reduce costs, and enable new missions of national and global importance. The global market for autonomous aircraft is expected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2040, and CAAMS will be a key asset in enhancing US competitiveness. Center research will support dozens of students every year, giving them hands-on experience with advanced autonomous systems and direct understanding of industry perspectives and needs.\r\n\r\nCenter outcomes will be broadly disseminated through archival publications, presentations at engineering and computer science conferences, and technical interchanges with aviation industry members. A single center-wide data repository will be established by the lead site with a password-protected web portal that can be accessed by all center industry members. Project data will be made available to center members annually and will be made available upon request to the public two years after the center fiscal year has ended.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
