 "awd_abstract_narration": "Being mathematically competent in today\u2019s society is critical for success. A child\u2019s early ability to recognize symbols, read numerals, count, and discriminate quantities all predict later mathematics achievement. Considering these predictive qualities of early math achievement, it is crucial to identify ways of enhancing early student numerical understanding. It is also important to determine which populations may benefit most from early learning enhancement methods. This project will investigate whether multisensory numerical input enhances numerical reasoning performance in preschoolers recruited from diverse socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. Upon kindergarten entry, the numerical performance of preschoolers from lower SES backgrounds is often lower than that of higher SES background peers. Strong math proficiency at the start of kindergarten helps lessen future discrepancies in math achievement among low SES children, so it is crucial to develop ways of aiding low SES preschool children in performing more effectively on numeracy tasks.\r\n\r\nThis study addresses the following research questions through a series of computer-based laboratory experiments: Does providing preschool children with multisensory, compared to unisensory, information about number improve their abilities to map symbolic to nonsymbolic numerical representations? Does it help them to perform basic arithmetic computations like addition and subtraction? Data analyses will also determine whether any such effects are mediated by SES, investigating whether multisensory information about number differentially boosts numerical performance for lower SES preschoolers. The experiments will further reveal whether performance on multisensory nonsymbolic and symbolic number tasks is correlated. Results will provide important knowledge about early mathematics learning in typically developing populations from diverse SES backgrounds. This research will pave the way for understanding the malleability of numerical thinking prior to formal, school-based learning, with the ultimate goal of providing more effective numeracy experiences before kindergarten. In order to build a STEM-competent society, it is important that all children enter school ready for math achievement.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
