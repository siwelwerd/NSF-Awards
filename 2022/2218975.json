 "awd_abstract_narration": "Automated and algorithmic decision systems are used extensively to enact public policy. Despite their use within the public domain as automated decision-making and resource distribution tools, these systems are often opaque and not publicly audited. Details that could provide a measure of reason and accountability are often hidden within proprietary contracts with third-party vendors. Without transparent and explainable processes, it is not possible to verify whether the outcomes satisfy ethical and fairness constraints. Without accountability, there can be no trust in the decisions produced by these systems. This project focuses on accountability, transparency, and explainability in the context of automated decision systems for public policy. This Mid-Career Advancement (MCA)Award supports Amelie Marian to work with a partner/mentor who brings different expertise. The PI leverages her background in designing ranking systems and decision-making algorithms to collaborate with the partner\u2019s team of legal scholars, policy researchers, and social scientists to develop guidelines and techniques for transparency and accountability in decision systems.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the accountability of algorithmic decisions through the perspectives of computation, law, and ethics. Transparency and accountability are critical prerequisites for building trust in the results of automated decisions and guaranteeing fair and equitable outcomes. The research involves secondary analysis of data used for public policy decisions in domains such as school admissions, vaccine and organ donation lists prioritization, job applications, public housing allocations, and ranked choice voting. The PI is using the MCA award also to deepen and create new collaborations with policy-makers, as well as establish new multidisciplinary collaborations with the project's mentor partner, Helen Nissenbaum, director of the Digital Life Initiative group at Cornell Tech. By involving a wide array of stakeholders and scholars, this research obtains a better understanding of what constitutes a fair, transparent, and accountable decisions, thereby increasing trust in the decision processes and leveraging algorithmic decision mechanisms for social good.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
