 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide electric power generation for spacecraft that is environmentally clean, has much higher power generation density per volume and weight than any existing alternative, has high reliability and nearly no degradation over time.  This power generation will utilize a process called Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) - a process that uses natural solar plasma produced by the Sun to provide electrical power. This technology will benefit society by allowing spacecraft and satellites to function more efficiently for longer periods of time. MHD generation also provides environmental benefits since it utilizes no hazardous materials and reduces the amount of fuel needed for launch, reducing carbon dioxide emissions. This project will also introduce a new type of ion funnel that is highly efficient and portable that can also be used in medical ion spectroscopy, resulting in reduced costs for this equipment and improved portability. The compact, high-density electromagnets developed can also be used to improve efficiency and power capability in many industrial and power system applications.  \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of providing electrical power generation for spacecraft that can meet the demands for producing large amounts of electrical power while reducing payload launch mass requirements. The objectives of this research are to prove the feasibility of utilizing the solar wind plasma in space as well as to determine the performance of Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) generation to produce electricity.  Modeling solar wind plasma conditions based on data from various space probes indicates that conditions of ion flux and plasma conductivity are conducive to support MHD power generation.  This research will answer the question of whether high-energy solar wind plasma can be harvested by MHD generation and unlock energy that is available. This research will involve design and development of a small MHD generator and testing a prototype in a vacuum plasma chamber that simulates solar wind plasma conditions.  The experimental results will be modeled with numerical simulations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
