 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing a software tool that will help students to learn data visualization theories and design principles. The use of data has become an essential part of the modern decision-making process. It is imperative that students learn how to analyze and reason about data. Visualization has become an essential method for analyzing and understanding data. Educators currently lack the tools that allow them to effectively teach students how to visualize data. The goal of this project is to develop a software tool, VisSymphony, that will allow instructors to create and moderate visualization-related classroom activities. To promote active learning, instructors will be able to provide real-time feedback to students, and the system will provide immediate feedback on student submissions. The project team plans to work together with partnering instructors to design the tool and to collect and analyze data to understand the effectiveness of the tool.\r\n  \r\nThis project intends to address two significant issues in visualization education: (1) The need for software tools that help students learn visualization design theories and principles, and (2) The lack of understanding of how classroom orchestration can improve visualization education and prepare students for the workforce. By evaluating how VisSymphony impacts the educational experience, the investigators hope to learn about how classroom orchestration can be operationalized to effectively teach and learn about visualization. The research team will use a two-cycle coding technique. In the first cycle of coding, the project team will use an open/initial coding method and in the second cycle use a pattern coding method. The team will then apply statistical tests to the coded data to understand how VisSymphony affects the visualization education experience. VisSymphony\u2019s development and refinement will follow a participatory design approach utilizing community feedback to create a flexible tool for education. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
