 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). Skyler Mendoza is awarded a NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (NSF MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and activities related to broaden participation by groups underrepresented in STEM. This fellowship to Dr. Mendoza supports the research project entitled \" MPS-Ascend: Development of a Dual Catalytic Fragment Insertion Reaction\", under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host institution for the fellowship is the Scripps Research Institute, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Keary Engle.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed work intends to explore the concept of fragment insertion/deletion, also referred to as \u201cmolecular editing\u201d. This reaction would take simple, easy-to-access 1,3-dienes and convert them into otherwise difficult to access value-added 1,4-diene products. Successful implementation of the work will result in the establishment of a conceptually distinct method for accessing skipped diene products. The PI will prioritize community outreach for young scientists historically excluded from the field of organic chemistry through a collaboration with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) at the University of California San Diego. Successful implementation of this collaboration will result in the creation of a \u201cMentorSHPE\u201d program at the Scripps Research Institute.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
