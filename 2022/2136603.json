 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the ability to develop a corneal sealant that will achieve significant cost savings for the patient, hospital ecosystem, and taxpayer by circumnavigating the limitations associated with corneal repair using the sutures or cyanoacrylate glue. Nearly 7 million corneal/scleral tears and perforations occur in the US and require surgical intervention. Around one third of these injuries cause blindness and 80% lead to infections and other complications. The high sensitivity of the corneal surface results in extreme discomfort and trauma with even slight abrasions and scratches. A significant portion of patients using current standards of care, i.e. sutures and cyanoacrylate glue, suffer from postoperative complications like eye fluid leakage, infection, and astigmatism requiring extensive care or corrective surgery. The sealant developed here may reduce these issues, resulting in cost savings for patients and insurance companies while improving the patient experience. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project seeks to optimize and fine-tune the sealant formulation as well as its application onto the corneal surface using a handheld bioprinting pen for the repair of corneal injury as well as the develop an appropriate models for its evaluation. The first objective aims to standardize and optimize sealant extrusion and photocuring onto the corneal surface while conforming to the depth and shape of the corneal injury. The results may optimize parameters to form a sealant film with improved biocompatible, mechanical, and adhesive properties. The second objective aims to establish sealant efficacy in corneal repair via long-term integration with the corneal tissue, using a corneal injury model. The expected results will establish the integrative capacity of the adhesive for filling corneal defects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
