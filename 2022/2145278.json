 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to use a new and upcoming wireless technology called ultra-wideband radios to perform indoor localization at the human navigation scale, fine-grained localization at the scale required for object tracking in indoor spaces, and for intrusion detection through monitoring of disturbances to the wireless profile of an indoor space. Several applications can benefit from the underlying constructs developed in this work, including indoor navigation and guidance systems, localization and navigation for autonomous agents in complex indoor spaces, tracking movements of robotic arms for accurate task completion as well as for compliance, and protection of valuables through intrusion monitoring and alarm systems. Thus, the fundamental work in this project is expected to impact several industries and advance mobile computing using wireless technology for localization and sensing.\r\n\r\nThis research will advance the state-of-the-art in wireless localization and sensing through novel algorithmic and architectural contributions leading to new protocols based on ultra-wideband (UWB) radio technology. This work comprises three research thrusts. In the first, it proposes to enable an infinitely scalable indoor localization technology that can span large indoor spaces, such as shopping malls, museums, government buildings, etc. using only a few UWB anchor devices. An unlimited number of users can derive their own location inside provisioned indoor spaces using UWB receivers that overhear signals sent by installed anchor devices, without transmitting any UWB signal, thereby ensuring their privacy. In the second research thrust, a fine-grained 3D localization idea is proposed which exploits specific channel patterns obtained using multiple antennas at a receiver. The phase of the received wireless signals is compared to provide fine-grained localization of objects or robotic arms in a relatively small space. Such a system can track exact robotic movements without using cameras, a significant advantage when operating in dark, dusty environments, and when the large amount of data produced and processing needs of cameras are not desirable. In the third research thrust, an intrusion detection system is proposed which monitors a protected space by analyzing disturbances in the wireless channel impulse response (CIR). The proposed system would allow friendly entities to freely occupy an indoor space and yet monitor it for intrusions by ignoring CIR disturbances in the vicinity of the friendly entity. Overall, a rich ecosystem of new applications is expected to be enabled by this work.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
