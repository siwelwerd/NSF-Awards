 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help chemists find drug candidates that can stick persistently to the correct target and work better in patients. By coming off the target prematurely, a drug stops working and may be cleared rapidly from the body. Current state-of-the-art technologies find weak binders and are plagued by other limitations. The system proposed herein tests large numbers of compounds at high throughput during drug discovery and lead optimization, replacing current systems with low throughput. The identified effective drugs must be selective to the intended target. Furthermore, the proposed system will inform Artificial Intelligence and Molecular Dynamics simulations for optimized algorithms predicting drug performance.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will solve an unmet analytical need in drug discovery and lead optimization by providing kinetic results at high throughput to refine drug designs. The proposed novel instrument and assay chemistry system measures how long chemical compounds stay on target. The solution will be benchmarked using FDA-approved drugs that use an allosteric mechanism of action to engage protein kinases AKT1 and AKT2.  Inhibitors will be profiled for biochemical binding kinetics, thermodynamic analysis, and kinase selectivity in kinetic assays using novel reagents and commercial instrumentation.  Dissociation rates for the allosteric drugs will be compared with literature reports. Analysis at several temperatures will measure the activation energy for the kinase to release the allosteric drug. The results will be a benchmark profile of kinetics and thermodynamics for kinase-inhibitor interactions of successful approved drugs. An advanced instrument will be built and tested in endpoint mode for sample handling, signal linearity, background and dynamic range using control reagents.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

In 2020, the United States was projected to have 18.1 million cancer survivors and cancer care costs of $157.77 Billion. More is spent on research and development (R&amp;D) for drugs to treat cancer than any other disease area. Cancer drugs cost an average of $2.771 Billion to develop.&nbsp; Unfortunately, oncology drugs in the R&amp;D pipeline have the lowest clinical approval rate, 6.7%. The other 93.3% of drugs that enter clinical trials for cancer patients did not work, and the failure rate is the worse than treatments for any other type of disease. If a platform for drug discovery can identify higher-quality drugs to enter clinical trials, the improved chances of those drugs to succeed should bring more effective drugs to the market more rapidly and lower cost.</p>\n<p>An effective medicine must attach well to its target. Generally, the most effective medicines can remain on their target for a long time and keep working for the patient. The best drugs usually have a long residence time on the drug target. By contrast, an ineffective drug falls off the target too soon (and then fails to stick back rapidly onto the target); that drug will be degraded, removed from the body and stop working. To get one marketed drug, 5,000-10,000 chemical compounds must be screened. A bottleneck is due to state-of-the-art laboratory technologies that have only a limited capacity for testing kinetics due to low throughput (only 8 tests per instrument) and high cost, so few drug designs are ever tested for kinetics. In a drug-discovery campaign, the vast majority of chemical compounds are never tested for ability to bind onto the target rapidly and persistently to work a long time, so many promising compounds are completely missed.</p>\n<p>The goal of this Small Business Innovation Research project was to develop and demonstrate the concept for an advanced platform technology (instrument and chemical reagents) for the high-throughput kinetic analysis of small molecule drugs binding to drug targets.

Four major design iterations of the detection system were evaluated with an overall 5000x improvement in sensitivity. The complete prototype is a highly parallel system that analyzes 384 tests simultaneously in two alternative acquisition modes. An advanced software algorithm was developed to enable the highest frequency mode of data acquisition. The system was sensitive and could detect binding &le;205 pM using the assay chemistry.

A futuristic application for the technology developed in this project will enable chemists to find superior drugs that can take advantage of the changing shape of the drug target. Next-generation drugs will bind to a target causing a certain change in the target shape (large conformational change due to an induced fit). These Next-Gen medicines will work better by being locked onto the target and show a longer duration of action in cancer patients.
