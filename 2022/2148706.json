 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to New York University, located in New York City, NY, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2022-2024. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. \r\nStudents will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Emphasis will be on quantitative research, as scientific progress increasingly requires quantitative skills and the analysis and interpretation of large data sets. Assessment of the program will be done through an online survey tool. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Biology laboratories located at the Washington Square Campus will host the students. Research encompasses diverse topics, including genomics, bioinformatics, ecology and evolution, proteomics, developmental and cellular biology, and usese various organisms, including microbes, plants, worms, and flies. The students will perform research involving designing experiments, gathering and analyzing quantitative data. The program includes an R workshop and weekly structured meetings to support literature reading, crafting presentations, career development, networking with mentors, training in ethics and responsible conduct of research. Participant selection is conducted by the program directors and mentors using a holistic approach that considers multiple variables beyond grades. The program and the faculty are highly collaborative and additionally interact with other programs in the NYC scientific community. More information on the program is available by visiting https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/biology/outreach/surp.html, or by contacting the PIs at surp.biology@nyu.edu.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
