 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stephanie Ho is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at New Mexico State University.  Ho will conduct observations and simulations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of nearby galaxies to study how gas flows in and out of galaxies.  Results from this project will elucidate how gas accretes onto galaxies, fuels star formation, and grows galactic disks.  Ho will also conduct outreach activities to increase awareness among underrepresented youth about astronomy as a possible career path. \r\n\r\nThis research project will examine the interplay between the cool CGM, the warm-hot CGM, and the galactic disk.  Ho will incorporate galaxy disk orientation into physical models of circumgalatic gas flow to explain the origin of the cool and warm-hot CGM.  Ho will also analyze mock absorption spectra generated using cosmological simulations to understand the observed kinematic misalignment between the cool and warm-hot phases of the CGM.  Finally, she will combine spectroscopic observations of emission lines and circumgalactic absorption lines toward nearby galaxies to analyze gas flow and understand the role of accretion in disk growth.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
