 "awd_abstract_narration": "The workshop aims to provide guidance for conducting ethical and responsible research with marginalized individuals in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields in higher education. The workshop includes both virtual and hybrid components for educators and researchers to identify best practices in the ethical and responsible research for under-represented communities. Identification of research considerations for marginalized individuals in higher education will assist researchers in STEM to ensure implementation of ethical, confidential, and appropriate research for vulnerable communities. Workshop products will be of interest to educators, researchers, students, administrators, and vulnerable research participants.\r\n\r\nThe workshop brings together subject-matter experts to discuss salient research ethics, create resources for educators and researchers, and to draft guidelines for ethical and responsible research involving under-represented groups in STEM. Products will include a checklist-style resource of considerations and an initial set of materials to use in ongoing professional development in STEM higher education contexts. The project include a brief pre-conference survey, idea generation virtual workshop series, an idea synthesis hybrid workshop, and idea propagation activities. Working groups composed of participants will focus on roadmap building and developing materials for dissemination of current best practices to appropriate audiences to ensure broad participation in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
