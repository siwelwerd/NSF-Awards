 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Award to Texas State University, located in San Marcos, TX, supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2022-2024. In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry, participants engage in research in chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science. REU Scholars also participate in a professional development course, which combines their research lab experiences with field trips and workshops to explore careers in the academic, government, and private sectors. Participants develop a robust understanding of how innovation bridges basic research and entrepreneurship. This site broadens participation in STEM by preparing participants for the wide variety of career opportunities in the molecular sciences.\r\n\r\nThe participants conduct individual projects that span all fields of chemistry. These projects include the characterization of electronically active polymers and nanoparticles, the synthesis of natural product derivatives with potential biologic activity, and analysis of proteins to build structure-function relationships. The professional development series includes seminars on scientific communication and careers in chemistry. To increase diversity in the chemistry workforce, this site recruits students from regional institutions, including public and private 2- and 4-year colleges, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
