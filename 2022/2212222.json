 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to care for patients suffering from diseases including diabetes, multiple Sclerosis (MS), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and cancer using nano dosage forms of drug molecules. Making drugs nano-sized helps them be absorbed and move to parts of the body where needed. The ability to manufacture nanosized drugs comes from the discovery that drug sizes may be decreased with a twin screw extruder, a type of machine usually used to produce bulk products such as plastic pipes, garbage bags, snack foods, cereal, and pasta. Before the discovery of the twin screw extruder, drug nanoparticles were only made in thimbleful quantities and were prohibitively expensive. This NSF SBIR Phase I project seeks to tap the potential of nano-sized drug forms by allowing them to be made economically and getting them into the hands of medical researchers. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to provide new knowledge related to surfactant-lipid-water systems and drug delivery nanoparticles. Although there has been much research focused on increasing the body\u2019s absorption of drugs using lipid nanoparticles, translation to the clinic has been limited because nanoparticles cannot be produced with sufficient reproducibility, quality, or in sufficient quantities, making them prohibitively expensive. This SBIR project seeks to solve these problems by using twin-screw extrusion, a process typically used for bulk manufacturing of commodity goods such as plastic pipes, garbage bags, snack foods and pasta. The twin screw extruder process is based on the transient formation of rupturable surfactant-lipid-water mesophases during transit through the extruder barrel. To be successful at the twin screw extrusion of drug nano dosage forms, new scientific knowledge must be created to advance conceptualization of surfactant-lipid-water systems from time invariant equilibrium structures to highly time dependent dynamic non-equilibrium processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFormulating drugs in lipid nanoparticles -- extremely small droplets of fats or oils -- is a well-known method for enhancing drug absorption for poorly soluble and poorly absorbable drugs and has been the subject of thousands of scientific publications.  The research performed under this NSF SBIR grant is directed towards unlocking the potential of lipid nanoparticles as delivery vehicles for introducing poorly bioavailable drugs into the human body.\n\nBecause the modest improvements in drug absorption using nanoparticles are negated by the expense and impracticality of making them, they have achieved little traction commercially.  This Phase I SBIR project addressed both absorption performance (Part 1) and the expense and difficulty of making lipid nanoparticles (Part 2).\n\nPart 1: Improving absorption of drugs in lipid nanoparticles. To study absorption of lipid nanoparticles, dasatinib (commercial name Sprycel, used to treat leukemia) was chosen as a test subject. Our strategy was to synthesize lipid nanoparticles that behave like bile salt micelles, i.e. nanoparticles produced in the small intestine that facilitate absorption of water insoluble drugs. Using the modified extruder described in Part 2 below, we prepared dasatinib nanoparticles that, like bile salt micelles, have small particle size and are not digested by pancreatic lipase.

The reason for such improved absorption efficiency of dasatinib in synthetic bile micelle nanoparticles is that dasatinib is not lost to precipitation during the steps of nanoparticle digestion and incorporation of dasatinib into bile salt micelles (Figure 2).\n\nThe explanation for the absorption delay for dasatinib in digestible lipid nanoparticles and for dasatinib suspension is time is needed for digestion, secretion of bile salts from the gall bladder, and formation of bile salt micelles from bile salts and the suspended drug (Figure 2).  Dasatinib is lost to excretion when it is not completely incorporated into bile salt micelles.\n\nPart 2: Improving lipid nanoparticle production. The extrusion process of US Patent 11,504,327 has high potential for manufacturing lipid nanoparticles because it provides three times higher nanoparticle concentrations, 75 times higher throughput and greater consistency (+ 3% particle size variation vs + 15%).  The continuous nature of the method facilitates compliance with the rigorous Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) mandated for commercial drug production.
