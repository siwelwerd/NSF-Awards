 "awd_abstract_narration": "Billions of birds migrate each year in journeys that are largely hidden from human observation, yet are \r\ncritical to the success of bird populations. To understand and monitor migratory species, data and \r\nmethods are needed that can capture the movements of bird populations across the globe. The eBird \r\ncitizen science project receives millions of bird observations throughout the year and uses these data to \r\nproduce detailed weekly abundance maps for hundreds of migratory species around the world. Despite \r\nthis rich information about bird distributions, scientists lack widespread, detailed data about the \r\nmigratory routes that link bird populations and their habitats throughout the year. In the BirdFlow \r\nproject, a team of computer scientists and ornithologists will use citizen science data to create models \r\nand algorithms to infer population movements of migratory birds. The models will allow inferences \r\ncurrently unavailable to ecologists at the scale of full populations and flyways, including simulated \r\nmigration routes and movement forecasts. The resulting data will help address urgent needs in ecology, \r\nconservation, and industry, including understanding connectivity between populations and links \r\nbetween migration and evolution, as well as applications to disease spread and aviation safety. \r\nVisualizations and educational material will be created to inspire the public and raise awareness about \r\nbiodiversity and ecosystem health. \r\n \r\nThe BirdFlow project will develop models and algorithms to infer bird movements from citizen science \r\ndata. Data products from the eBird Status and Trends project will provide information about the weekly \r\ndistributions of bird populations, and optimization problems will be formulated to infer population \r\nmovements that are consistent with the weekly distributions and approximately minimize energetic \r\ncosts. Individual tracking data and other evidence will be used to validate and improve models. \r\nTechnically, the work will build on an emerging line of research that uses probabilistic graphical models \r\nto learn about probability distributions over many variables from partial information, such as noisy \r\nestimates of the distributions of individual variables. Software and data products will be created that \r\nwill allow scientists to use pre-fitted BirdFlow models to simulate synthetic migration routes and create \r\nmovement forecasts for species of interest. The project team will use BirdFlow to conduct ecological \r\nresearch about patterns and drivers of migration in the Western Hemisphere. Project information can \r\nbe found at https://birdflow-science.github.io/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
