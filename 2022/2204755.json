 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a platform for training surgical residents to practice and improve critical suturing techniques for laparotomy.  This is expected to enhance resident learning during simulation training, which may translate to improved knowledge and muscle memory. The learning experience may improve knowledge, skills, and readiness for surgical residents, which may result in improved clinical outcomes. Expected outcomes include the minimization of complications following abdominal closing and better patient well-being and satisfaction as more well-prepared physicians enter practice.  Effective development and deployment of this technology may significantly lower the barrier required to train surgeons for advanced surgical procedures, and result in an improvement in healthcare training and practices.  \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a simulation software platform for surgical training.  The proposed human-in-the-loop learning approach is a surgical laparotomy simulation with mechanical feedback additionally supported with instruction by an experienced surgeon suitable to effective surgical training.  The device may lead to a better understanding of how human errors in suturing affects force distributions in sutured biomaterials, and which strategies for suturing are the most optimal mechanically.  In addition, it may be used to match the learning approach to the capabilities of the trainees that are at different training stages.  The proposed technology also may be used to simulate patients from diverse backgrounds, which may lead to knowledge of how variances of mechanics and geometry presents challenges in determining the best techniques for surgical operations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project focused on customer discovery and building a business model canvas to inform decisions for translating the core technology of medical simulation devices towards a commercial product.  The proposed innovation is a modular surgical training platform that leverages fundamental knowledge of biomaterials, biomechanics, and manufacturing for simulating surgical procedures while providing feedback to users that improves learning.  Interviews were conducted with medical students, surgeons, teachers, buyers, and administrators domestically and internationally.   The goal of interviews was to better understand potential customers, decision makers, and processes that support customer adaptation of new medical training technologies.\n\n \n\nFindings demonstrated the technology has the potential to fill a market gap between low-cost suture pads and higher cost simulators while providing additional innovations such as mechanical feedback.  The business model canvas demonstrated a favorable beachhead market with support from academic institutions as piloting partners and further start-ups as design and manufacturing partners.  Prototyping was conducted to build a proof of concept from customer discovery findings.  Further research and development of the proposed technology will lead to a simulation platform for aiding surgical trainees to practice and improve critical techniques that better prepares them for the challenges in the operating room. \n\n \n\nThe intellectual merit of the work was an improved understanding of the needs and effective interventions for surgical training that was reached through customer discovery and prototyping activities.  The broader impact of the work is the discovery and creation of new technologies to aid medical training.  Effective development and deployment of the technology will significantly lower the barrier required for trainees to prepare for advanced surgical practices, thereby resulting in a wide-spread improvement in healthcare training and standards.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/23/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul F Egan"
