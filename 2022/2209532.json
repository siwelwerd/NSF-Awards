 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a nerve interface that will provide patients with intuitive prosthetic control. The global market for advanced upper-limb prosthetics is expected to be valued at $0.87 billion in the year 2024. However, despite their high cost, patient satisfaction for these devices remains low. Current solutions do not provide reliable or intuitive control of robotic hands and arms while creating a burden on the prosthetist trying to provide patients with a comfortable and functional prostheses. The I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of a nerve interfacing technology by testing the hypotheses around these customer and end-user needs, as well as the needs of other stakeholders in the ecosystem such as physicians, surgeons, occupational therapists, and insurers. Beyond this application, the customer discovery model can be used to validate similar products for other patient populations who need to control prosthetic, rehabilitative, or digital devices. This technology may not only improve the well-being of patients, but also reduce employment shifts that are common after disabilities. It further advances a field that is vital for the United States to maintain a productive and competitive workforce.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of the regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI). The proposed RPNI technology is built by grafting small muscles on the ends of severed nerve branches that reinnervate the grafts. This technique has three key benefits. First, the muscle grafts naturally amplify small nerve signals into large amplitude electromyography. Second, it reduces limb pain by preventing the formation of neuromas. Third, it allows us to use muscle as a biological cuff to implanting electrodes for a prosthetic interface. Control signals may be read from the nerve with higher functional specificity, strength, and stability than current technologies. This technique has been validated in rodent and primate models and is currently being evaluated in a clinical trial. Research has demonstrated intuitive control of individual finger and grasp movements without the need for frequent controller adjustments or recalibration. Should this technology be commercialized, people with amputations may no longer require a certain amount of remaining musculature or a high gadget tolerance to benefit from a multi-articulating prosthetic hands.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
