 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RAPID project will investigate indoor air pollution associated with the recent Marshall Fire in Colorado, that started as a grass fire on December 30, 2021. Smoke from the fire infiltrated into undamaged homes surrounding the burnt areas and left ash and soot behind, noticeably impacting indoor air quality. Measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM) are being made inside and around multiple homes in the area beginning on January 8, 2022. This RAPID project will provide support for the continuation of these measurements to assess the sustained fire impacts on air quality and for the analysis and presentation of the results.\r\n\r\nThis project will address the following questions: (i) What is the composition of indoor air in smoke-impacted homes after the Marshall Fire? (ii) Which physical processes control the continued release of pollutants from smoke-impacted homes? (iii) What is the composition of the contaminated ash and soot left behind in homes? (iv) What are the continuing emissions of air pollutants in the burnt area? (v) What levels of PM were people exposed to during and after the Marshall fire? \r\n\r\nThis information is of interest to local communities and health departments. Five graduate students will be trained to assist with this project.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Smoke from the fires infiltrated into undamaged homes surrounding the burnt areas, left ash and soot behind, and impacted indoor air quality very noticeably to the evacuees returning to their homes. In this project, we made measurements of the chemical composition of air inside and surrounding smoke-damaged homes near the burnt area. We also analyzed the chemical composition of soot and ash left deposited inside homes after the fire. We made the following observations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ash and soot sampled collected from indoor surfaces showed a clear burning signature but did not contain unusually high levels of toxics such as metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).</li>\n<li>Indoor air inside smoke-impacted homes had low levels of fine particles, except during remediation efforts. This underscored the need to use personal protective equipment during remediation, such as respirators and protective suits.</li>\n<li>Indoor air contained elevated levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during the first 4-5 weeks after the fire. After this time, indoor concentrations had decreased to levels that are more normally seen inside homes. The chemical composition of the VOCs contained a burning signature, including toxics such as benzene and PAHs. The concentrations of these compounds were similar to what can be observed in polluted urban air, and we are researching the health implications in a separate project using surveys.</li>\n<li>We found that VOCs in indoor air can be significantly reduced by opening windows to increases ventilation, and by using air cleaners with activated carbon filters. However, after turning off the air cleaners and/or closing the windows, indoor VOCs would increase again to the same level observed before opening the windows and/or running the air cleaner. This shows that there are large reservoirs of VOCs inside the homes that are only slowly releasing VOCs to indoor air. Our project could not establish what these reservoirs are, but we suspect that drywall, wood, concrete ad brick might all play a role. Further research will be needed to find which of these materials are the most efficient at retaining VOCs for long periods of time.</li>\n<li>Finally, we participated in a study to quantify the release of VOCs from the burning of building materials such as various wood products, siding, roofing, insulation, carpeting and wiring. Future research will be focused on finding which of these materials left behind combustion by-products in the homes affected by the Marshall Fire.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to these scientific findings, our project was important as it was able to address community concerns about the environmental impacts of the Marshall Fire.
