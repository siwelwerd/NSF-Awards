 "awd_abstract_narration": "South Dakota State University (SDSU) will enable regional research and educational programs with high computational and data-intensive needs through the acquisition and deployment of an advanced computing instrument. The goals of this initiative will accelerate scientific discovery, promote active engagement, advance collaboration within the research community, and provide a resource within the region to advance and elevate multi-disciplinary STEM education and research. A breadth of science and engineering fields will benefit from this acquisition, including climatology, satellite image processing, national food safety and security, genomics of bacterial infections, antibiotic resistance, and power grid security. This project will also be a focal point for supporting the educational and research needs of underserved communities throughout the region.\r\n \r\nThe team within SDSU Research Cyberinfrastructure (RCi) will acquire and implement a robust advanced computing instrument that accomplishes the following key project objectives: (1) Widening and boosting computing core capabilities within research pipelines that harness the power of vector and parallel computing; (2) Advancing the usability of CPU and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) resources using Open OnDemand and Science Gateways; and (3) Amplifying the accessibility of highly cost-effective computational tools to a larger user base. The system design uses a next-generation computer architecture with hardware resources specifically designed for boosting computing capacity. The instrument will offer the flexibility of scaling research applications, allowing the user to self-provision resources and facilitating ease of access for new researchers. This will be achieved using off-the-shelf open-source software resources and pre-built scientific workflows. This instrument will serve as a computational core for RCi at SDSU, serving researchers, collaborators, staff, and students engaged in research and education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
