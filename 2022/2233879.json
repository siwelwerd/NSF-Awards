 "awd_abstract_narration": "Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks span an increasingly diverse set of stationary and robotic devices (e.g., aerial drones, autonomous ground vehicles). Achieving communication synchrony, reliability, and fault tolerance among these devices is a key challenge due to the complex dynamics of mobile, heterogeneous devices deployed in real-world environments. This project will begin to address that challenge in the context of IoT networks operating across multiple mobile agents. The project will take a \u201cground up\u201d approach, beginning with addressing fundamental differences in simulation mechanics between multi-agent robotics simulators and network simulators. Three main objectives will be pursued: (1) The project will explore integration challenges associated with combining physics-based simulators and discrete event-based simulators. A new network coordinator will be developed to synchronize the simulation timelines between these systems. (2) Using this integrated framework, the project will study the propagation of errors arising from within the constituent platforms under a range of scenarios (e.g., varying agent speeds, varying networking protocols). (3) Finally, the project will integrate the simulation framework with physical devices to enable hybrid experimentation, reducing the \"simulation-to-reality\" gap.\r\n\r\nAs IoT networks increasingly expand across multi-agent robotic environments, their utility in realizing mission-critical services will grow. Potential applications already being explored include search and rescue services, wildfire monitoring, and flood impact assessment. This project will begin to provide the computer and network systems foundations necessary to construct these systems in a manner that ensures communication synchrony, reliability, and fault tolerance. More generally, this project will catalyze innovation in the design and validation of large-scale IoT networks built upon stationary devices and mobile robots. The impact on future mission-critical IoT systems --and the resulting economic and societal benefits-- could be significant. The project will also contribute to workforce development through the involvement of undergraduate researchers, high school students, and a postdoctoral researcher. The PI is committed to broadening participation and will actively recruit students from groups underrepresented in computing.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
