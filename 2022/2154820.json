 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Karl Scheidt of Northwestern University is developing new catalytic transformations. The discovery and development of catalytic transformations to access saturated heterocycles described in the research plan is a crucial enterprise with broad potential impact on a wide range of scientific endeavors with material, biological and pharmacological endpoints. The proposed studies aim to facilitate access to chiral heterocyclic compounds through new bond-forming reactions. These new catalytic reactions will enable the efficient and sustainable construction of high value-added molecules and materials with broad impact on pharmaceutical research, material science, and biomedical research. By investigating these new approaches to heterocycles, early career scientists, including those with diverse backgrounds, will be trained and supported throughout their research experiences. To further the goals of this award, strong efforts will be made to increase the awareness of the role of modern science in our society with an emphasis on chemical science and catalysis. \r\n\r\nThis proposal focuses on the continued development of new methods for synthesizing enantio-enriched saturated heterocycles. By merging new photocatalytic strategies with established catalysis platforms, the Scheidt group seeks to expand the compatibility and applicability of transformations developed earlier in the group. The integrated synthesis and cooperative catalysis approach taken in the group is a distinguishing feature of these studies. The discovery of new oxidative catalytic reactions driving innovative synthetic strategies is a crucial enterprise that enables synthesis to have a broad impact on a wide range of scientific endeavors. Throughout the proposed work, the Scheidt team will rely  upon high throughput experimentation and catalytic reaction development to guide investigations. The results from this work will likely facilitate the improved design and rapid synthesis of target compounds via catalysis. The knowledge obtained from this research plan is expected to expand the number and classes of heterocycles accessible using oxidative, photocatalytic Prins strategies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
