 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computational Structural Bioinformatics Workshop (CSBW) is a single-track, one-day workshop featuring peer-reviewed works on advances in computational methods in structural biology. Understanding the fundamental role of protein and nucleotide structures in life processes involves many computational challenges. It is held as part of the IEEE-Bioinformatics and Biomedicine. New experimental and computational techniques that generate and use large amounts of structural data have enabled novel analysis approaches, leading to an increased understanding of different biophysical phenomena. CSBW provides a forum for discussion of the newest computational approaches related to protein structure discovery and analysis. Structural biology is an interdisciplinary field, and CSBW connects scientists who work on this topic through the lens of various academic areas, such as computer science, bioinformatics, biochemistry, and computational biology. One of the main goals of the proposed workshop is to connect undergraduate and graduate students to the  computational bioinformatics community, giving them an opportunity to present their work to top scientists in  the field and to network with their peers. Such interactions have a lasting impact in a student\u2019s academic life, as they expose students to state-of-the-art research and creates the professional connections needed for career advancement.\r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop will bring together senior researchers and students working on exploring the relationships between sequence, structure and protein function via computational structural bioinformatics. The workshop will showcase the newest developments on a diverse set of problems and computational methods, including: Structure representation, prediction, and alignment, biomolecular interaction and docking, molecular dynamics simulations, biomolecular graphics, coarse-grained modeling, data mining of structural data, structural genomics, optimization in structural problems, high-performance computing in modeling, graph theory applied to structural problems, and biomolecular structure refinement. The participation of researchers from diverse backgrounds will advance understanding of common scientific themes and may facilitate collaborations around shared research goals. Papers accepted to the workshop will be published in IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Workshop participants will also receive invitations for a special issue in a peer-reviewed journal.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
