 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create and experiment with an integrative approach to applying machine learning (ML) method in traffic management, in the new era where ridesharing is seen as integral to Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), in order to improve mobility for all users. An integrative approach tailors the principles of ML methods\u2013\u2013rather than prepacked toolboxes\u2013\u2013and immerse them with the domain knowledge to create new, hybrid methods.  The transportation sector is currently experiencing monumental disruptions with the introduction and constant evolution of new technologies and mobility services.  The SEA\u2014Sharing, Electrification, and Automation\u2014change is expected to transform how mobility is planned, provided, and used by people and companies in cities and beyond. The importance of traffic management will grow as the broad trends toward sharing continue in the next decade. Ridesharing has long been considered a low-hanging fruit for traffic management.  Thanks to emerging technologies (e.g., transportation network companies and autonomous driving), the popularity of ridesharing has grown markedly in recent years. Fueling this renewed interest is the promise to make ridesharing flexible, user friendly, efficient, and cheap. In the era of MaaS, ridesharing would likely become a major, if not dominating, mode of travel.  The results from this project will help the public sector evaluate how ridesharing can be leveraged to improve the efficiency, environmental sustainability, and equity of our transportation systems.  \r\n\r\nThis project will create a novel methodology for a range of challenging transportation problems involving sequential hierarchical optimization. By bringing together transportation science, game theory, optimization, and ML, the framework exemplifies an integrative approach to cross-disciplinary research. It also opens new pathways toward harnessing the power of ML in the transportation domain on the one hand and brings stimulating new challenges to the attention of the ML community on the other. The project introduces and analyzes the problem of managing traffic by ridesharing, which is born of recent technology advances but has yet to receive much attention. This problem connects hierarchical optimization, a traditional topic in transportation, to ridesharing, a rapidly growing field of study in several disciplines (economics, computer science, and transportation), and promises to push forward the frontiers of both. The findings will deepen our understanding of ridesharing not only as a mode of cooperative travel but also as a tool for traffic management.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
