The formation of COFs \u201cunder confinement\u201d has been studied at a variety of interfaces, but not for reactants trapped between two solid surfaces.  Graphene is a single layer of covalently linked carbon atoms that is easily exfoliated from graphite and can trap highly mobile molecules at solid surfaces.  With this LEAPS-MPS project, Professor Ryan Brown\u2019s research group at Clarkson University investigates trapping reactants between graphene and a solid surface to study COF formation at a solid-solid interface.  They look at how COF growth changes when reactants are confined between solid interfaces.  Some COF linkages are not easily formed through a direct condensation reaction at surfaces or in solution due to competing reactions or desorption at the high-temperatures.  Prof. Brown\u2019s group employes graphene confinement as a strategy for carrying out these inaccessible reactions, as well as using graphene trapping to pattern COF growth for linkages not normally formed through direct condensation reactions.  In addition to the science aspects, the project also engages underrepresented communities within the Mathematical and Physical sciences field through seminar invitations for pre-tenure faculty, professional development workshops for undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds, and the provision of paid research experience for high school students from the local indigenous communities.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nThe growth of two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) confined at a variety of interfaces is an active field with a variety of outcomes based on the nature of the confinement.  So far though, the existing body of work in this field does not address the consequences of forming 2D-COFs under confinement by a solid-solid interface.  Understanding COF growth confined between solid-solid interfaces is important for assessing the viability of employing this class of materials as intercalation species to modify the chemical, optical, or electrical properties of two-dimensional materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides and MXenes.  With this LEAPS-MPS project, Professor Ryan Brown\u2019s research group explores the impact of physical confinement between solid surface on COF growth by employing scanning probe microscopy (SPM), spatially-resolved Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and density functional theory calculations to assess changes in the mobility and reactivity of COF precursors confined between exfoliated graphene and solid interfaces.  Exfoliated graphene can confine gases, liquids, and small molecules at solid interfaces, and the graphene-mica and graphene-Au(111) interfaces are used as experimentally accessible model systems for confinement at a solid-solid interface.  Professor Brown\u2019s research group investigates the impact of a graphene capping layer on the growth and morphology of COFs formed from common condensation reactions for single and multiple reactant systems.  This work also extends to assessing the viability of using graphene confinement at surfaces to produce COF linkages not readily accessible through direct condensation reactions.  Additionally, Professor Brown works with existing organizations within Clarkson University to enhance the mentoring, training, and career progression undergraduate students and pre-tenure faculty members from underrepresented backgrounds in Mathematical and Physical Sciences through a series of enrichment activities and research opportunities.  High school students from the northern New York indigenous communities gain valuable research exposure and experience through this program, as well.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n The outcomes of \"LEAPS-MPS: Mobility and reactivity of covalent organic framework precursors under physical confinement by exfoliated 2D materials\" encompass a broader understanding of the impact of physical confinement between solid interfaces on the growth of covalent organic frameworks (COF). This project demonstrated that reduced mobility of the reactant molecules for COF-1 (benzene diboronic acid, BDBA) combined with enhanced exposure to water, which can break the bonds in the COF-1, produced large crystalline domains in regions beneath exfoliated graphene as compared to those grown on mica. The conventional understanding of solution phase COF growth through condensation reactions (as is the case with COF-1) produce larger crystallites in the presence in small amounts of water, and then tends to erode the size and quality of crystals under increased water exposure. When this reaction occurs with the reactants trapped between solid interfaces (graphene and mica), the erosion mechanism does not apply because the reactant molecules are unable to diffuse away from the crystalline domains prior to reacting again. The reduced mobility allows for greater error-correction (re-orientation of the reactants can alleviate defects and more ordered crystalline domains) of the COF-1, as compared to COF-1 simply grown on top of a mica interface.\n\n\n This project was the first to examine the impact of confinement between solid interfaces on the growth of COF's. In addition to the observation of enhanced crystallinity of the COF product, this project also produced evidence that there is non-trivial water transport between the external ambient environment and into the graphene-mica interface. The literature on this topic is varied and contradictory at times, with graphene either acting as a tight seal on the region of mica below the exfoliate flake (no water transport in or out), to an equilibrium between trapped water and external humidity. This project clearly showed that at elevated temperatures (above 100 degrees Celsius), there is substantial transport of water into the region between the graphene flakes and the mica surface. This transport of water was noted in the studies of COF-1 growth, and could be observed independently by examining the deformation of graphene flakes on mica after controlled exposure to humid environments at elevated temperatures.\n\n\n In sum, this project developed new understandings in how organic reactions occur when confined between solid interfaces. The results were both non-intutive, particularly with the observation of enhanced crystallinity of COF domains formed under graphene flakes, and added to our existing understanding of water and matter transport in and out of these regions of confinement (the area between the graphene flake and mica surface). These results indicate that further study of this class of reactions under this form of physical, two-dimensional confinement could lead to new insights into the mechanisms of crystal growth and generally matter transport into regions of confinement between solid interfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/10/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RyanDBrown\n"
