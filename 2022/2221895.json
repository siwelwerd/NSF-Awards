Clinical application of the proposed 7-gene assay may improve patient care and outcomes for those with lung cancer and reduce healthcare costs for the payers resulting from the failure of initial treatment.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a 7-gene marker panel that accurately predicts the risk of recurrence in early-stage NSCLC patients for all histological subtypes. Employing novel artificial intelligence (AI) methods, the assay also predicts the clinical benefits of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy in both proof-of-concept training and validation sample sets. This 7-gene assay may identify high-risk early-stage NSCLC patients following primary tumor resection for cancer recurrence, inform oncologists of the risk of recurrence to improve patient management, and recommend early implementation of platinum-based chemotherapy for high-risk stage 1 NSCLC patients.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
