The conference will be held at the main campus of Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan June 16-19 of 2022. The conference aims to promote collaborative, interdisciplinary research by bringing engineers and life science researchers together at the same venue.  The conference is designed to be highly interactive, with talks, poster sessions and informal meetings. Conference sessions will include topics such as cell biology, synthetic biology, photosynthesis and metabolism, and microbial ecology. There will be ample opportunity for sharing the latest research results and for networking.\r\n\r\nThe Workshop on Cyanobacteria series is a long-standing conference that brings together an international team of research scientists in the area of cyanobacterial biology and biotechnology. The Workshop presents a unique opportunity to facilitate intense and productive communication between researchers from multiple disciplines, all sharing a common interest in cyanobacteria either as the direct subject of their research or as experimental models to investigate fundamental scientific questions. Keeping with the traditions of the Workshop on Cyanobacteria series, a main focus is placed on the training and inclusion of the next generation of scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
