 "awd_abstract_narration": "Real-time interactive (RTI) services are anticipated to be the \u2018\u2019next big thing\u201d in information technology, merging the areas of sensing, computation, and communications that until recently have been treated separately. In traditional systems, these building blocks are not optimized to work with each other, and particularly not in real-time, constraining the type of services that can be offered.  RTIs require real-time aggregation of distributed data streams onto edge/cloud compute servers that can process data as soon as it is generated. The goal of this project is to develop a general mathematical framework as well as concrete algorithms to provide such RTI services with guaranteed latencies. The results benefit the US economy by enabling more efficient, more reliable, and more resilient automation schemes, e.g., for smart factories and farms, as well as improved augmented/virtual reality. The interdisciplinary nature of the project benefits the students working on this project; a detailed plan for outreach and increasing participation of underrepresented groups strengthens the impact of the work.\r\n\r\nThe project designs a general mathematical framework and concrete algorithms for reliable and resilient Real-time interactive (RTI) systems. In a first thrust, the project explores the limits of delivering latency-critical services reliably. The establishment of the reliable network stability region provides bounds on how much offered RTI traffic a network can support under the best of all algorithms. A packet-lifetime-based queuing model serves as the basis of Lyapunov-drift-inspired control algorithms that not only account for the packet delay but also takes cost such as energy consumption into account. A second thrust of the project develops robust NextG network control algorithms that can adapt to dynamic network states. Integration of the approaches in the first two thrusts under a common Lyapunov drift control framework is an avenue to enable reliable RTI service delivery, which is verified by the implementation of the algorithm on a Platform for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) community testbed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
