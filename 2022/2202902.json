 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arid Central Asia (ACA) will be strongly affected by future changes in water supply. Impending temperature increases along with changes in precipitation amount and type (snow or rain), as well as high population growth, are expected to bring environmental and economic stress to the region. ACA is a region characterized by varying geography and includes the Tian Shan Mountains (highest peak 7,439 m). The rate of warming on Earth is not uniform and varies with latitude and altitude; the poles and high elevation regions are warming the fastest. Large populations typically reside in lower elevation regions but often depend on runoff from the mountains as a water source. This is the case for ACA, which receives a small amount of annual precipitation, and where mountains and lakes are critical natural resources. For these reasons, is important to understand how future climate change will affect ACA. This research will generate temperature, precipitation and vegetation records spanning the past 13,600 years from Issuk-Kul, a large mountain lake in Kyrgyzstan. These new records will reveal the past climate history of ACA and will advance understanding of regional and global climate processes. Improved knowledge of past mid-latitude climate dynamics in ACA is needed to predict future conditions more accurately. This research will support efforts to broaden participation from underrepresented groups in STEM by providing hands-on summer workshops for middle and high school girls in partnership with the Eureka! Science Camp, run by Girls Inc. of the Valley (Holyoke, MA) and the College of Natural Sciences at UMass Amherst. High school interns also will be hosted during summers to gain laboratory experience.\r\n\r\nIssyk-Kul, one of the world's largest and deepest lakes, represents a presently understudied paleoclimate archive. This research will provide a multi-proxy organic geochemical study of Issyk-Kul using existing sediment cores to test hypotheses including that the lake experienced greater warming compared to the Northern Hemisphere average during both the mid-Holocene thermal maximum and since 1850 AD, that ACA received moisture from the East Asian Summer Monsoon during the mid-Holocene, and that shifts in the algal and microbial communities of Issyk-Kul occurred in response to climate variability. Multi-decadal to centennial-scale paleoclimate records will be produced. Proxies based on glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) will be used to generate a quantitative temperature reconstruction from ACA over the deglaciation and the Holocene, in conjunction with plant wax (n-alkane) deuterium and carbon isotopes as proxies for shifts in the dominant moisture sources (the Westerlies, the Siberian High, and the East Asian Summer Monsoon) and vegetation type (C3 versus C4 plants), respectively. Better understanding the paleoclimate history Issyk-Kul will constitute a major advance in the paleoclimatology of ACA where there are few existing records and where spatial and temporal variability is poorly understood.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
