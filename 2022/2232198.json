 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for support of the conference Genetic Recombination and Genome Rearrangements, to be held August 14-19, 2022 in Steamboat Springs, Colorado.  This is a well-established conference that has occurred biennially since 1985. The meeting will include 8 plenary sessions, each of which will have 6 to 8 20 minute presentations. Two thirds of the speakers are by invitation, and the remainder will be from contributed abstracts, with an emphasis on early career scientists. This meeting will have over 200 participants representing all career stages, from trainees to established PI\u2019s. The committee will make a special effort to provide plenary speaking opportunities and short poster talks to diverse junior scientists as well. Notably, all NSF funds will be used to support participation by trainees and young investigators, with an emphasis on those from under-represented groups as well as those with financial need. \r\n\r\nThe conference will focus on the topic of recombination and its implications for chromosome segregation, DNA repair, genome rearrangement, and mutation. These topics will be explored from multiple perspectives,including structural and biophysical analyses of the proteins involved in recombination, and genomic analyses of the consequences of recombination for genome structure. The meeting will emphasize breakthroughs spurred by cutting-edge approaches from structural biology, molecular genetics, and biochemistry as applied to DNA damage responses, chromatin remodeling, and the general processes of replication and recombination.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
