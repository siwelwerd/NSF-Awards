 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. SUNY College at Brockport is acquiring a femtosecond laser that is coupled to a streak camera time-resolved fluorescence spectrometer to support the research of Professor Mark Heitz and colleagues Paschalis Alexandridis, Johsua Blose, and David McCamant. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of chemistry, biochemistry, and chemical engineering. A streak camera, when combined with a femtosecond laser, can be used to study ultrafast dynamic processes of chemical systems. The streak camera detector works by recording spectral data using multiple channels at very high frame rates. Spectra can be resolved into sub-picosecond contributions to understand excited-state decay kinetics and molecular dynamics as a function of molecular interactions. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions.\r\n\r\nThe award for the femtosecond laser and streak camera is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as the understanding of solvation energetics and dynamics as the driving force behind solvation in deep eutectic solvents. In addition, other investigations include building a deeper understanding of control variable for improved electron transfer in nanoparticle-based solar energy production and determining structural stability of model DNA and RNA oligomers in ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents to improve solution viability for extraction, purification, pharmaceuticals, nanotechnology, and long-term storage. It also aids in the determination of variables that govern chain interactions in xanthan gum.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
