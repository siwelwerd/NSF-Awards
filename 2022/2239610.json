The Workshop on Learning-augmented Algorithms, to be held in December 2022 in Chennai, India, aims to set the agenda for the area by identifying important topics, questions, and directions for focused effort.  This meeting will prepare students and postdoctoral researchers to contribute to this important emerging area of research and will promote collaboration among senior researchers interested in this area.  The program will feature tutorials and talks by invited speakers.  Students of underrepresented minority groups are especially encouraged to participate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
