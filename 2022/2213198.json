 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is jointly funded by Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nNon-technical Description:\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation award supports the acquisition of an advanced scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), which is housed in a purpose-built laboratory within the Electron Microscope Facility at Dartmouth College. While located at Dartmouth, the STEM serves regional research and teaching opportunities over Northern New England including at the University of New Hampshire, the University of Vermont, and the University of Maine-Orono, where it is the only microscope of its kind. The remote monitoring and operation capabilities facilitate access for off-site users, including for courses and projects in statewide networks of primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI). The STEM supports teaching and research training of undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows, and broadens the participation of women and under-represented groups in biology, chemistry, engineering, and materials science through programs at Dartmouth and the University of New Hampshire, and through remote training and outreach via statewide PUI IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence. Many of the research projects are designed to yield direct benefits to society, addressing critical needs including energy production and storage, gas-sensing, advanced materials, and catalysts.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThe acquired STEM has a high-brightness field emission gun capable of operating from 20 kV to 200 kV, and is equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The microscope makes possible many projects requiring high-resolution imaging and elemental analysis, as well as tomography and low-dose imaging for biological and beam-sensitive specimens. It enables research to answer fundamental questions regarding the structure, formation, properties, and interactions of a wide range of advanced materials such as high-entropy alloys, intermetallic compounds, porous organic materials, incrementally-formed sheet metal, tau-MnAl and NiFe permanent magnets, proton-exchange membrane cells, silicon devices for radiation damage detection, SiGeSn alloys, Na-S battery materials, nanoparticles alone and embedded in porous thin films, novel Li battery materials, nanocrystalline alloys and nanolaminates, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides, non-oxide ceramics, and biomolecular specimens and biomaterials.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
