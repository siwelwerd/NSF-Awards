 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is devoted to addressing existing technological challenges toward building a computer made of DNA. Electronic computers have dramatically improved information processing speed and ultimately promoted progress in science, education, technologies, and welfare. However, modern electronic computers are difficult to use inside human bodies as they are made of non-biocompatible and non-biodegradable materials. Moreover, electronic computers can not directly recognize chemical inputs (e.g., proteins, hormones, DNA, and RNA) and require chemical sensors with capabilities to translate the chemical recognition event into an electronic signal. On the other hand, computers do not have to be electronic. For example, some early computers used mechanical movements of their components as input/output signals. Biomedical applications would benefit if computers were made of biological molecules. Such computers could be used as components of molecular biorobots to continuously control the health state of a human body without human assistance. In addition, they could be used in personalized medicine to analyze complex mixtures of biological markers, thus improving health care in the nation. The principles of the DNA nano-processor developed in this project can impact the biomedical field by providing efficient tools for monitoring and correcting a disease state.  The concepts and experimental approaches used in this project will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate education.\r\n\r\nThe Project Investigator's long-term goal is to construct a molecular scale processor from DNA logic gates. This project includes the following stages needed for building a DNA nano-processor. First, principles for integrating DNA logic gates in DNA circuits will be developed.  Second, principles of connecting two integrated circuits in a more complex circuit will be established to enable modular and scalable construction of complex DNA circuits. Third, a universal mechanism for powering the integrated DNA circuits via signal amplification will be developed. Finally, the developed technologies will be applied to assemble complex computational circuits made of DNA molecules. Therefore, this project will solve the problems of DNA logic gate integration and powering. The solution to these problems will create a basis for manufacturing a DNA computer, a smaller and biocompatible counterpart of the modern silicon processors. The research activities will be integrated with education via (i) developing biochemistry wet lab experiments dealing with the integration of DNA logic gates and their application in molecular diagnostics; (ii) research training of students at undergraduate and graduate levels; (iii) outreach program. The outreach activity has the potential to impact high school students across multi-ethnic Central Florida through partnerships with local high schools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
