 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the fundamental tasks in processing sensor and imaging data\r\nis to solve an inverse problem, determining the nature of some\r\nfundamental structure that produced that data. Such problems are\r\noften underdetermined, meaning that the number of unknowns exceeds\r\nthe number of observations, and these problems are even more\r\ncomplicated in the blind setting, where the fundamental structure\r\nmay undergo some unknown transformation en route to the sensor.\r\nThis project considers a number of such blind inverse problems,\r\nincluding non-stationary deconvolution, where an unknown point\r\nspread function changes over time; multi-band signal\r\nidentification, where line spectrum estimation is extended to\r\nsignals with multiple narrow frequency bands; super-resolution\r\nradar imaging, where extended and accelerating targets may cause\r\nunwanted spreading in the delay-Doppler space; and simultaneous\r\nblind deconvolution and phase retrieval. Conventionally, all of\r\nthese problems have been studied separately. This project\r\ninvestigates all of the problems jointly under a unifying\r\noptimization and analysis framework.\r\n\r\nBy modeling unknown transformation operators using subspaces, the\r\ninvestigators transform each non-convex inverse problem into a\r\nlinear inverse problem of recovering a structured signal. This\r\nsignal is a parsimonious mixture of lifted atoms generated by the\r\noriginal atomic set, allowing the investigators to enforce its\r\nsimplicity using a new atomic norm. The investigators develop novel\r\nanalysis techniques to demonstrate the optimality of this framework\r\nby deriving sampling complexities that achieve the\r\ninformation-theoretical limits, calculating mean-squared denoising\r\nerrors that match the minimax rates, and developing parameter\r\nestimation bounds that approach the Cramer-Rao bounds. The project\r\nbuilds on the investigators' combined expertise in signal\r\nprocessing, convex optimization in continuously parameterized\r\ninverse problems, and geometric modeling.",
