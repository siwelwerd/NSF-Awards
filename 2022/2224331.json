 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent progress has made it possible to make predictions about the complex effects of species interactions and to analyze complex data from nature. The problem is that the connections between the predictions and the results of complex data analysis are not always clear. This workshop will bring together statisticians with theoreticians and empirical scientists who use process-to-pattern links in their research approaches. The goal is to improve the integration of these areas of research to better understand how they might affect both microbial and \u2018macrobial\u2019 organisms. The broader impacts of the project are to train early career scientists such as graduate students, post-docs, and assistant professors and to provide tools that can help develop better management of natural resources in a changing world. \r\n\r\nThe first workshop will identify promising approaches to link theory, statistical, and empirical analysis. During this workshop participants will also discuss how to best address possible challenges. A second virtual workshop, open to the broader science community, will further expand and enrich the initial findings. In the short term, the project is aimed at producing a review of current findings and promising future directions.  In the longer term the project envisions to solidify and enhance the methodologies that can drive future research in community ecology and eco-evolutionary dynamics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nProject Outcomes Report\n\n\nEcology is the study of the interactions among organisms and their environments in the context of spatial effects. At the metacommunity level, that involves numerous species interacting in a complex landscape of patches, these interactions can, and often do, become intertwined in very complicated ways; Charles Darwin called this problem the entangled bank in the last paragraphs of the Origin of Species. Since Darwin, methods to describe and understand the elements of this entangled bank have improved, and dramatically so in the last 25 years or so. At this point, we have methods that can resolve the patterns that exist in the distribution of species among patches with great resolution, and we have models that explain the processes the are involved in determining these patterns but we still lack ways to quantitatively relate these patterns to the underlaying processes very well. That means that still cannot explain processes from patterns except in very crude ways.\n\n\nIn this workshop we brought together early career scientists (graduate students, post-docs and pretenured faculty) who are working at the cutting edge of resolving this problem to try to identify what critical problems need to be solved in order to overcome the existing challenges. Our workshop resulted in a fantastic confluence of ideas that we hope to pursue in future work, either on our own as we each pursue future directions as we progress with our careers, but also involving future collaborations among ourselves and with others.\n\n\nWe find that current methods are not likely to solve this problem even if our methods improve. This implies that we need to look for new ways to describe and define the problem, both in the ways we analyze ecological data, and in the ways that we develop theories that can capture the missing pieces in understanding the link between process and pattern in metacommunities. We are finding some possible directions forward but more work will be needed before we can identify which of these are most likely to lead to future progress.\n\n\nWe currently have one published paper from our work and another that is near completion. We anticipate that a few more might also soon result from this workshop in the next year or two.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/16/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MathewALeibold\n"
