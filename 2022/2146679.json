 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a device to treat chronic lymphatic system failure (lymphedema). An estimated 10 million Americans are affected by lymphedema while two-thirds of all cases are cancer-related. Lymphedema is a chronic condition that prevails throughout the patient\u2019s lifetime, and passive treatment methods, such as compression devices, are routinely used to treat the condition. However, currently patient compliance is a problem.  The proposed device is intended only to be worn for a short period of time unlike compression stockings and is expected to improve patient compliance and satisfaction. Current sequential compression devices are reported to be uncomfortable, which also results in reduced patient compliance. The ergonomic design of the proposed device may be more comfortable, which is expected to result in increased patient compliance.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a technology to treat lymphedema. The proposed device is designed to create 20,000 compressions per minute, whereas the currently marketed sequential compression device only creates 1 compression per minute. The core technology produces sound waves in a novel pattern of microcurrents to move fluid. The sound wave technology may be used to treat lymphedema, edema, fibrosis, fibromyalgia, and venous insufficiency in various tissues that include lymph, nervous, connective, and muscular tissue. This device has been tested in silico and data support the proposed mechanism of action, and the therapeutic effects have proven successful in a human model.   The goal is improved lymphatic return to reduce the girth of the limb and improve function thereby alleviating symptoms of lymphedema.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
