Invited presenters will bring together information on distinct technologies and insights as related to biological clocks and how they interact with social behavior. This symposium, and IUSSI, presents a unique opportunity to bring researchers together to facilitate synergy, professional development, future research collaborations, and a better understanding of the economically important social insects. Presenters represent a broad range of career stages and fields and there is strong participation of individuals from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. Undergraduate students will also attend the IUSSI providing a valuable early career experience. \r\n\r\nBiological clocks organize aspects of life at different levels of biological organization. Participants in this symposium and the focused meetings around this symposium will help form a deeper understanding of social insects, social behavior, and biological clocks potentially leading to new frontiers of research and understanding. Also, of interest and focus here is seasonal timing of behavior and how the adaptive nature of seasonal behaviors could be impacted by climate changes. Planned publications will share the synergistic outcomes of the symposium.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Biological clocks organize aspects of life at different levels of biological organization, from daily activities to seasonal timing of behavior. Adaptive nature of seasonal behaviors could be impacted by climate change. A deeper understanding of social insects, social behavior, and biological clocks will lead to new frontiers of research and understanding to tackle problems of adapting to a changing environment. In this symposium 22 researchers from 7 countries communicated new findings that resulted in 1) defining research directions in social, seasonal, and organismal clock mechanisms in the field named Sociochronobiology; 2) a novel effort for international scientists to examine potential global collaborations that can apply basic research findings to improve climate response.\n\n\nThe role of biological clocks in organization of highly eusocial insects is increasingly better understood. Yet deeper understanding is developing in new frontiers such as asking questions on detailed clock regulatory mechanisms and functional, social role of individual differences in biological rhythms. One big question, in the clock field, is how the daily clock may serve seasonal patterns. Yet adaptiveness of seasonal patterns is threatened by climate change. There is additionally a practical significance to this topic, since for social insects, including the main agricultural pollinators, honey bees, climate change brings challenges to survive seasonal changes.\n\n\nThe symposium during the 5-day meeting resulted in developing key research directions, highlighting significant findings, and beginning of international collaborations. The research directions included: a. Levels of sociality and associated differences in circadian rhythms and mechanisms, and b. Core gut microbiota in social vs solitary organisms and its relation to circadian rhythms. The collaborations included developing novel neuroimaging methods and application of gene targeting to non-traditional model organisms. After the symposium a special issue in the journal Peer J, titled: Biological Clocks and Social Organization was prepared to disseminate the results broadly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impact on students and researchers amplified because the symposium helped overcome the barriers resulting from COVID 19 pandemic conditions to the networking and collaboration opportunities.
