 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) for the R/V Hugh R Sharp, a 146-foot regional research vessel operated by the University of Delaware as part of the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF). Sharp is a state-of-the-art, coastal research vessel that is owned and operated by the University of Delaware. The vessel can carry fourteen to twenty scientists on cruises up to eighteen days in duration and supports projects from all disciplines of oceanography. The vessel is a regional asset, serving researchers from many institutions throughout the mid-Atlantic. The vessel typically operates in the coastal waters from Long Island, New York, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as well as the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. In 2021, Sharp completed 144 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 221 days or 15% of the sailing schedule. In 2022, Sharp is scheduled for 160 days with NSF days accounting for 56% (90 days) of the total sailing schedule. SSSE requested in this proposal includes:\r\n\r\nReplace the ship\u2019s Palfinger main Crane\t$256,439\t\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis NSF Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) Award funded replacement of the R/V HUGH R SHARPs 18-year-old main crane.\n\n\nThe crane was beyond service life and in need of replacement. The crane is critical for day to day operations of the vessel. The crane has been adequately maintained, was rebuilt in 2014, and has served dutifully and safely for 16 seasons. The crane needed to be replaced or risk to safety of personnel, equipment, and mission accomplishment will increase.\n\n\nThe main crane of the SHARP is used to load and unload equipment onto the main deck, deploy and recover scientific equipment over the side, lift a personnel basket to access sheaves on the A-frame, and lift equipment or sensors for attachment to the ships masts. The crane is a critical and essential tool for the ship to accomplish science missions.\n\n\nThe project was completed within the planned budget. Residual funds were used to support overhaul of the forklift used to load and unload science equipment and stores. All systems are working as expected.\n\n\nThe SHARP is a state of the art research platform owned and operated by the University of Delaware. The vessel entered service in 2006 and is a member of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet and the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS).\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/15/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JonSwallow\n"
