 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. The University of Notre Dame is acquiring a dual-source single crystal diffractometer equipped with high-flux Cu and Mo microfocus X-ray sources, a CPAD detector, and a cryogenic device to support the research of Professor Allen Oliver and colleagues Vlad Iluc, and Emily Tsui. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution. The facility serves as a regional XRD resource benefitting students and faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions within the state of Indiana with impacts outside ND through active collaborations with researchers at institutions such as Tennessee Tech University, St. Mary\u2019s College, Elizabethtown College, and the University of Victoria, B.C., and maintains private sector affiliations. They have developed international collaborations with colleagues from Chile, Canada, and New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. Research enabled by the instrument is focused on the study and characterization of a wide variety of substances including enantiopure and chiral organic compounds, drug precursors and other biologically important molecules, organometallic and inorganic complexes and mineral-like materials. Structure determination of metal complexes (e.g., catalysis), solid-state materials (e.g., energy conversion), and absolute configurations of light-atom molecules (e.g., natural products) is essential to drive research in these fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
