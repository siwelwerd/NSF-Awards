 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in low-cost low-power silicon radio frequency (RF) integrated circuits (ICs) in the last two decades have opened up the commercial applications for millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies which are an order of magnitude beyond those used in WiFi and cellular today. Large-scale deployment of mmWave communication networks, such as NextG cellular infrastructure outdoors and NextG WiFi infrastructure indoors, implies that these resources can be leveraged for RF imaging at scales that are not otherwise possible. The project develops foundational algorithms, architectures and protocols for such Joint Communication and Imaging (JCAI) systems. Each sensor in such a system provides 4D measurements (range, Doppler, azimuth angle and elevation angle) whose resolution improves by going to higher frequencies.  The project establishes US leadership in a critical technology by developing large-scale RF imaging using frequencies beyond 100 GHz. Outdoor applications include pedestrian and vehicular tracking for global situational awareness supporting vehicular autonomy, and addressing security challenges such as timely detection of illegal drones or unauthorized personnel.  In indoor settings, the technology enables fine-grained inference/prediction of human actions for eldercare and smart home applications. RF imaging technologies are especially useful in low-light or high-smoke/fog conditions when visible light or infrared technologies are not effective.\r\n\r\nThe project develops and demonstrates a framework for JCAI at mmWave frequencies.  A core aspect of the technical plan is to drastically improve resolution by synthesizing large apertures (Thrust 1). This employs a combination of novel approaches to single sensor design which utilize large antenna arrays developed for communication, and networked collaboration between multiple sensors. A complementary aspect (Thrust 2) is the strategic utilization of unmanned vehicles to image difficult-to-reach areas, utilizing the fixed infrastructure to reduce the robot payload. In Thrust 3, hardware at 140 GHz previously developed by the PIs for communication will be adapted to support demonstration of networked RF imaging at 100+ GHz.  Thrust 4 develops a control plane for networked imaging, including a resource management framework based on imaging demand and imaging capacity, and protocols supporting collaborative imaging. The concepts and methods to be developed have potential impact in a vast array of applications, including vehicular autonomy and road safety, manufacturing automation, indoor and outdoor security, eldercare, and healthcare.  The PIs will work closely with industry partners, building on their strong track record in transitioning mmWave research, and plan to incorporate this research into the undergraduate curriculum through courses, capstone projects, and REU projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
