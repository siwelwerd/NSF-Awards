 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rise of big data has increased the demand for technological innovations in data storage while traditional electronics is reaching its physical limit. DNA, an emerging data storage material, is a viable alternative to silicon-based technology due to its high capacity and low operational energy. However, current DNA storage technologies lack the structural access and allocated organization of data encoded in DNA. The core operations require complex and slow writing and readout processes such as sequencing, which leads to practical barriers in speed, sustainability, and scalability. To address these challenges, this project aims to develop the first DNA-encoded metamaterial data storage system, which could give rise to a rewritable and high-speed integrated random-access system.  This project holds tremendous potential to transform informational DNA materials into useful devices to enrich human capabilities from tiny memory with unprecedented speed to ultra-fast optical computers and biosensors, benefiting society and the economic sectors in the US.\r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary research project uniquely integrates powerful concepts developed in the fields of DNA nanotechnology and metamaterials to construct a novel platform for digitally coding DNA metamaterials. Information bits will be designed, encoded, and decoded by the helicity or handedness with DNA origami-enabled chiral meta-atom nanostructures. Biomolecular-based computation coupled with metamaterial modeling will inform all the design aspects of the system from molecular, meta-atom to system-level scales. Random access in such a system will be achieved dynamically via subwavelength optical modulation coupled with DNA templated patterning, providing high capacity, light speed readout capability that breaks the limits in transient electronics. The success of the project will significantly advance the fundamental understanding of biosciences, materials, information science and technology,  paving the way for the next generation of bio-nano data storage and information technology.\r\n\r\nThe project was jointly funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF) in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE); Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) in the Directorate for Engineering (ENG) and the Division of Materials Research (DMR) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
