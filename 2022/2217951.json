Both are operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) as part of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF) which is scheduled by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). Both are owned by the U.S. Navy, have state-of-the-art instrumentation, and support all disciplines of oceanographic research.  The vessels work in all the world\u2019s oceans supporting science funded primarily by U.S government agencies.
