 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving college students' success in introductory physics. General Physics I (PHY 210), a calculus-based introductory physics course, is a \"gateway\" course for all STEM majors at Hostos Community College. The course serves a diverse population of students, many of whom are first-generation college students and are from groups historically underrepresented in STEM. In this project, the investigators will redesign this course by implementing a strategy called \"Doing Physics\" (DP), which emphasizes problem-solving, scientific reasoning, and collaboration. The new approach to the course will integrate inquiry-based science, collaborative and game-based learning, course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), and mentoring students to pursue independent research opportunities. The aim is to increase the retention rate and pass rate in the course, and thereby to increase the number and diversity of students who pursue, persist in, and complete degrees in STEM. At many colleges and universities, an introductory physics course is required for, and sometimes poses a barrier for, students pursuing STEM majors. Therefore, the new curriculum that will be pilot-tested in this project has the potential to become a model for improving introductory physics nationwide.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to improve student outcomes in a calculus-based general physics course, and thus better prepare the students for subsequent science and engineering courses and for careers in STEM. The project team will develop the \"Doing Physics\" pedagogical approach, implement it in the General Physics I course, expose students to authentic research through CUREs, prepare students to apply for and succeed in intensive summer research experiences (such as NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates [REU] opportunities), and measure the impact of the new approach through rigorous evaluation. Expected outcomes for the students include higher completion and pass rates in the course; increased persistence in STEM, graduation in STEM, and progression to STEM careers; and enhanced confidence, self-efficacy, sense of belonging, identity in STEM, and collaborative skills. The project evaluation will use a mixed-methods approach, looking at the program's impact on students' academic performance, progress relative to developmental objectives, retention (within the institution and within STEM disciplines), and post-graduation outcomes relative to non-participant peers. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. This project is also supported by the NSF HSI Program, which has the goals of enhancing the quality of undergraduate STEM education and increasing the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of students pursuing associate or baccalaureate degrees in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
