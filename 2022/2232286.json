 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a community of practice among Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to facilitate proposal submissions to NSF. It will also prepare faculty at HBCUs to be more active in the proposal review process.  If successful, this activity will serve as a model that can be expanded to other types of emerging research institutions.  \r\n\r\nThe project seeks to increase the submission of successful research proposals originating at HBCUs. It develops and implements a replicable model for technical assistance support for HBCU researchers and sponsored programs personnel at HBCUs that will strengthen research development and reviewing skills. The project will recruit two groups of people at each one of the HBCUs involved: one group focused on the development and submission of proposals and a second group that receives immersive training in proposal review. Amongst other training activities, participants in the project will be mentored in the process of proposal development and proposal submission and participate in mock review panels.  An external assessment component will examine the impacts of the training.  This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
