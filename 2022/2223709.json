 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to address leaky gut and improve the microbiome. Leaky gut, or increased intestinal permeability, is an unhealthy gut lining that may allow partially digested food, toxins, and microbes to be released. This may trigger inflammation and changes in the normal gut flora that could lead to problems within the digestive tract. Currently, there are no products on the market with clinical evidence of ability to address leaky gut. The proposed technology may relieve leaky gut and its associated inflammation, as well as improve the host\u2019s microbiome. The proposed technology increases the presence of beneficial bacteria indiscriminately by making the gut a more suitable place for probiotics to live and thus does not decrease microbiome diversity. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a bacterial strain called Lactobacillus paracasei D3.5 that was discovered by screening hundreds of human-isolated bacterial strains to treat leaky gut.  The bacterial strain was selected for its unique ability to stimulate mucus-secreting cells of the colon called goblet cells. Because the components of the bacteria responsible for these effects become more bioavailable after killing the bacteria with heat, the heat-treated version called Postbiotic LPD3.5 was used for a subsequent preclinical study. In this study, the preparation was found to restore the thickness of the colonic mucosal layer in aging mice, which then led to the recovery in tightness of the connections between epithelial cells lining the gut. Both of these effects prevented bacteria and toxins from leaking through the digestive tract into the blood stream, and relieved the associated inflammation, a condition referred to as leaky gut. Moreover, Postbiotic LPD3.5 also was shown to strengthen the host\u2019s bacterial community, decrease anxiety, and improve insulin sensitivity, muscle function, and memory. In order to test whether Postbiotic LPD3.5 is able to stimulate the mucus production in humans, human goblet cells were treated in vitro. The effects seen in human goblet cells were the same as those observed in goblet cells of mice.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProgress summary\n\nAfter completing the I-Corp program this whole year our team expanded on the strategies and plans we developed during the 7-week iCorp program.  We\u2019ve accomplished several tasks since completion of the iCorp program.  Below are high-level bullet points of what Postbiotics Inc has accomplished:\n\nContinue to build on potential customer, marketing and manufacturing relationships that were formed during the interview process of I-Corp\nAssembled the information we obtained learned from I-Corp, interviews, etc., to develop a full business plan and financial model\nDeveloped a PowerPoint presentation for investors for our first round of capital\nNearing the first stage of obtaining our first batch of product&mdash;to be used in the lab as well as clinical trials\nDevelop full blown business plan pitch deck, executive summary and business plan for capital raise\nContinue to develop and strengthen our IP (US Patent filed as well as PCT)\nFiled the trademark for the product name we would like to launch\nActively working for first round of fund raise to kick start clinical trials and product launch.\n\n\nDescription of work to be accomplished\n\nDue to issues with Covid-19, travel and meeting restrictions placed on our team and has limited us in attending conferences that were key to our product and company.  These events would have normally taken place during the I-Corp program.  We have been able to make reservations at several key conferences that will give us the opportunity to meet with a multitude of people that cover a number of areas that we had hoped to address during the I-Corp program.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nPostbiotics is in the process of identifying an investor for a significant investment round\nContinuing to search for funding opportunities through NSF SBIR grants\nInitiate clinical trials to fully support GRAS status\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/04/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hariom Yadav"
