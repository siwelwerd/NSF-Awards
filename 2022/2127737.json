 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic is warming faster than any other place on Earth, with sea ice declining rapidly and sources of sea spray and aerosol emissions derived from living organisms (biogenic) are consequently changing. Utqiagvik is at the forefront of this change, abutting one of the largest areas of sea ice loss. These atmospheric aerosols could have far-reaching impacts to both the climate, environment and resident community. Because this change has happened largely in the last decade, now is an important time to document changes and continue a data record that will allow for a characterization of the New Arctic. The longest and most complete record of airborne fine particles (or \u201caerosol\u201d) and their properties in the American Arctic is that of Utqiagvik, where NSF, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Energy have contributed to making this unique location serve as a regional record of changes in atmospheric aerosol properties. That record has served as the basis for hundreds of publications on questions from atmospheric chemistry to climate science to ecology and biodiversity conservation, which clearly demonstrate the broad, cross-disciplinary scientific value of these measurements.\r\n\r\nThis research will extend the baseline measurements of this Arctic aerosol record, including a continuation of the 15-year record of submicron inorganic components, re-instituting the 2-year record of organic components collected a decade ago, enhancing the chemical analysis with sulfur isotopes to improve interpretation of emission sources, continuing particle number size distribution measurements, and re-starting cloud condensation nuclei measurements. Re-starting sampling for organic components provides a comparison to that of 2008-2010, documenting the myriad of source changes in the last decade. Observations for continuing size distribution records and re-starting cloud condensation nuclei measurements provides the link from the chemical record of sources to the physical impacts on climate and the environment. This project will also allow analysis and archiving of the last 7 years of inorganic filters that were collected and the next 5 years, extending the inorganic aerosol composition record to almost 30 years. In addition to making the data widely available for a breadth of research, a journalist will publish articles in local news media to broaden the awareness of Utqiagvik\u2019s historic role as an Arctic observatory.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
