 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the conference \u201cAlgebraic structures in topology\u201d in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to be held on May 30th-June 3rd, 2022. The conference will focus on recent developments in algebraic topology and its applications to geometric topology, mathematical physics, and algebraic geometry. This event aims to bring together mathematicians from diverse subfields in algebraic topology, who use similar techniques to achieve different goals and foster new ideas and perspectives. The conference will feature plenary talks, mini-courses, contributed talks, and time for informal interactions. Another major goal of the conference is outreach to mathematicians from unrepresented racial and ethnic groups who may feel isolated from the larger mathematical community. \r\n\r\nThe guiding theme of the conference is the use of algebraic and categorical techniques to better understand the homotopy theory of spaces, the algebraic topology of manifolds, and algebro-geometric objects. The following are among the topics that will be highlighted at the conference: the theory of operads, equivariant homotopy theory, higher category theory and derived algebra, Hochschild homology theory of structured algebras, and algebraic K-theory. More information is available at the conference website https://sites.google.com/view/algebraicstructures.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
