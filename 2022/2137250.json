 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Advanced Non-Ferrous Structural Alloys (CANFSA) at Colorado School of Mines (Mines) and Iowa State University (ISU) is the only university-led consortium performing non-ferrous alloy physical metallurgy research, from lightweight magnesium to high-temperature refractory alloys. CANFSA generates and applies new knowledge to solve challenging problems identified by university, government, and industry stakeholders via pre-competitive research, supporting faculty, and building a student workforce pipeline trained in areas of strategic importance to U.S. manufacturing, especially relevant to aerospace and defense. CANFSA investigates industrially-relevant processing-microstructure-property-performance relationships with state-of-the-art experimentation and modeling, trains the next generation of non-ferrous physical metallurgists, and supports students, faculty, and curricula in physical metallurgy.\r\n\r\nCANFSA\u2019s thrust areas include lightweight, high temperature, and other materials, including coatings, spanning the aerospace, energy, defense, national security, infrastructure, automotive, and biomedical sectors. ISU has the equipment, infrastructure, and personnel to support research in non-ferrous physical metallurgy and the expertise in physical metallurgy, materials characterization across scales and modalities, and materials processing to tackle difficult problems through basic and applied science, with state-of-the-art experimentation and modeling and application- and manufacturing-based insights. CANFSA projects are structured to leverage the outstanding capabilities and personnel at Mines and ISU along with industry partners and national laboratories.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
