 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Michael Harmata of the University of Missouri-Columbia is studying a family of chemical reactions that generate seven-membered rings of carbon atoms. The transformations being investigated involve so-called [4+3]-cycloadditions, wherein a domain spanning three atoms within a reactive species containing either a nitrogen atom (oxidopyridinium ion) or an oxygen atom (oxidopyrylium ion), adds in an organized fashion to a four atom-spanning component (a diene). This research is important because it will facilitate the generation of seven-membered ring cyclic substructures that occur commonly in biologically active molecules, including natural products and pharmaceutical agents.  In addition, fundamental new insights concerning issues such as molecular reactivity and bonding are likely to emerge from these studies. The broader impacts will include a high school outreach program that includes students from groups traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and provides advanced chemistry experiences through laboratory-based summer internships. Professor Harmata will also organize an event called \u201cSaturday Morning Science,\u201d at which faculty from across the University of Missouri-Columbia will present their research to the general public in a manner that will excite and cultivate an interest in science among members of the community of all ages.\r\n\r\nThe funded research focuses on significant further development of the [4+3]-cycloaddition chemistry of the title species with an emphasis on the identification of viable strategies to effect high levels of regio- and stereocontrol. In addition, tailoring processes to convert the complex bicyclic cycloadducts into targets of ultimate interest, including bioactive alkaloids, are likewise under investigation. In a major aim of the research, kinetic and thermodynamic effects in the cycloadditions of conjugated dienes bearing sulfur or silicon substituents will be studied for the purpose of achieving regiocontrol. In other work, functionalization of the bridgehead positions of the cycloadducts will be explored to further extend the utility of the chemistry being pursued. Finally, the conversion of the cycloadducts to cyclohepta[b]-pyrroles and cyclohepta[b]indoles will be developed.  Such heterocycles are considered privileged structures as they appear in many alkaloids of biological and pharmaceutical interest.  These studies build upon a substantial body of work in the PI's laboratory to define the potential for complex cyclic ring structure construction through [4+3]-cycloaddition chemistry and, as such, are expected to define more completely this interesting dimension of synthetic organic chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe question of the types of nitrogen substituents that could be used in the (4+3) cycloaddition reaction of oxidopyridinium ions was answered. We showed that a variety of functional groups could be tolerated in the pyridinium species. These results lend credence to the idea for further studies taking advantage of such functional groups in the construction of molecular scaffolds derived from these cycloadditions.\n\n\nThe 3-hydroxypyridines used to generate oxidopyridinium ions must be substituted in a certain way in the oxidopyridinium ion are to be successful as dienophiles in the (4+3) cycloaddition reaction. We demonstrated that substituents at the 5 position must be electron-withdrawing and showed that not only esters, by ketone, aldehyde, sulfone, phosphonate, and cyano groups can be employed to successfully engage the cycloaddition reaction. A synthesis for some phosphonates was devised.\n\n\nThus, the (4+3) cycloaddition of oxidopyridinium ions has certain structural requirements. When the nitrogen substituent on the precusor pyridinium salt is sp3-hybridized, in a addition to the hydoxy group at the 3 position, there must be an electron-withdrawing group at the five position. The question of how weak such a group can be and still allow for cycloaddition remains to be addressed, but we know that neither a bromide nor a trifluormethyl group is capable of facilitating the process. Nevertheless, the functional scope of the molecular scaffolds that can be produced by the methodology is extremely broad.\n\n\nIntermolecular (4+3) cycloadditions of oxidopyridinium ions could be conducted using 3-sulfolenes as protected surrogates of dienes. Such sulfolenes are primarily easily handled solids and are especially convenient substitutes for dienes that are volatiles, such as 1,3-butadiene. Our work in this area suggests that the process in generally and that all sulfolenes that can undergo retro-chelotropic loss of sulfur dioxide to form dienes in situ will be successful in undergoing (4+3) cycloadditions with a variety of oxidopyridinium ions and related species.\n\n\nOur studies directed toward the anticancer agent daphnicyclidin A, have resulted in the preparation of the ABCE subsubstructure of the target in which the relative stereochemistry is set correctly and uniquely in the cycloaddition step. In this latest result, a key quanternary center was set, boding will for the preparation of the natural product. However, other key studies, including the establishment of the key D ring in the target molecule and enabling functional group transformations need to be developed. This approach also makes use of sulfolenes, demonstrating their utility in intramolecular (4+3) cycloaddition reactions of oxidopyridinium ions.\n\n\nStructural modification of all (4+3) cycloadducts is important. Research directed to this end resulted in the reduction of a cycloadduct and the formation of ethyl 1,5,6-trimethyl-1,4,7,8-tetrahydrocyclohepta[b]pyrrole-3-carboxylate, a specific example of a relatively simple structure that is of interest for potentially interesting pharmacological properties. The establishment of the scope of this chemistry remains for future studies.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MichaelHarmata\n"
