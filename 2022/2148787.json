 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dissertations Symposium in Chemical Oceanography (DISCO) XXVIII and XXIX\r\n\r\nThis award will support the 28th Dissertations Symposium in Chemical Oceanography (DISCO XXVIII), which will be organized by faculty from the University of Hawaii\u2019s Department of Oceanography. This biennial conference, initiated in 1978, provides recent and soon-to-be PhD graduates in chemical oceanography with an opportunity to present results from their dissertation research and participate in professional development activities. The symposium fosters collaboration and networking amongst the attendees as well as with attendees of the Physical Oceanography Dissertation Symposium (PODS), which runs concurrently. In addition, participants receive information about proposal preparation, research cruise planning, and how to request ship time through the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). The DISCO XXVIII symposium will be held in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii in October 2022. Participants for this symposium will be selected from early career scientists who have received a doctoral degree in ocean chemistry in the year preceding the symposium or who are expected to graduate within one year following the meeting. The symposium will be advertised widely, including outreach to under-represented groups and the wide variety of institutions that train students in chemical oceanography.  Symposium attendees will be selected by the meeting organizers, the guest speaker, and agency personnel from the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Similar to past meetings, the DISCO XXVII symposium is expected to advance the professional development of early career chemical oceanographers, both U.S. and international, and will build a cohort of scientists able to provide the research capacity and future leadership needed in ocean sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
