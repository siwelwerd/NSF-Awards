 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States (U.S.) has been experiencing a semiconductor chip shortage due in part to the pandemic. This shortage has impacted businesses and industry, including automotive, consumer electronics, data science, and cybersecurity to name a few. Efforts are underway to support semiconductor and microelectronics technologies in the U.S., which will require a prepared and diverse skilled technical workforce to support these critical economic engines. A strong nanomanufacturing workforce will enable the U.S. to be competitive in the global economy and will support the U.S. leadership in microelectronics and semiconductor technologies. This project led by the Center for Nanotechnology Education and Utilization at Pennsylvania State University will support members of the U.S. military, veterans, and family members to gain the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) to move into the semiconductor and microelectronics workforce. Many of these individuals have relevant experience with military technology as members of teams responsible for building mechanical, electrical and communication systems. Veterans without direct military technology experiences also have skills such as teamwork and project management skills that industry recognizes as needed skills within their workforce. \r\n\r\nThis project will provide educational opportunities for military personnel, veterans, and family members to gain the KSAs needed to enter the nanomanufacturing workforce. Members of the collaborative include 2-yr and 4-yr institutions, microelectronics companies, and the Global SEMI Trade Association. The project will leverage a successful pilot that involved the U.S. Navy, Tidewater Community College and Norfolk State University, which will be adapted and scaled to involve additional academic institutions and branches of the military. The project will: (1) adapt and implement the content of the pilot and offer a Microelectronics and Nanomanufacturing Certificate Program (MNP) supported by community and technical colleges and universities, (2) continually assess and adjust the content in consultation with industry for skillset needs, (3) work to secure the endorsement of the MNP by departments of veteran services for different military branches, and (4) elevate the role of community and technical college faculty in the delivery of the MNP minimizing the dependence on the research universities. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
