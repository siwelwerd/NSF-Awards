 "awd_abstract_narration": "Immersed granular media or dense slurries are densely packed grains suspended in a viscous liquid. They are found in natural environments, such as landslides, mudslides, and underwater avalanches, and in industrial settings, such as propellant slurries and ceramic material processing. Such materials play a crucial role in environmental hazards in which large volumes of dense slurries become mobile and slump triggered by heavy rainfall, earthquakes, and human influences. In such catastrophic flows, grains may lose contact and spread for long distances in a short time. The goal of this award is to develop experimental, theoretical, and computational methods to accurately predict the spread of these dense slurries when the grains are not in frictional contact. This understanding is essential to avoid or reduce the impacts of natural disasters. In addition, data acquired will be useful to researchers interested in developing new engineering materials. Results from this award will be incorporated into classes at Cornell University to promote active learning and student success in mathematics and physics. Various outreach activities are planned to inspire interest in engineering among K-12 students by illustrating the societal impact of engineering science.\r\n\r\nResearchers have recently provided well-resolved experimental data demonstrating that the transition from viscous to inertial regime in dense frictionless suspensions occurs at a surprisingly small particle Reynolds number. The results suggest a hypothesis that the interplay of colloidal and hydrodynamic forces leads to the formation of clusters of particles which dominate the transmission of momentum across the material.  Therefore, larger length scales than the particle size may play a role. Consequently, the current local rheological laws based on binary collisions and transfer of momentum are inadequate in explaining the behavior of dense suspensions and their transition. This award will develop a theoretical description of cluster formation based on collisional dynamics. Nonlocal constitutive equations accounting for the viscous stresses and inertial impacts acting on the clusters will be derived using insight into the microstructure obtained from discrete element simulations and experiments. Advanced force microscopy will be used to characterize interparticle interactions at nanometer separations and guide the development of model suspensions. Advanced experimental techniques such as optical indexed-matching, X-ray radiography, and computed tomography will be coupled with conventional rheometry techniques to understand the details of microstructure while measuring the macroscopic stresses. Experimental flows will be designed and studied in which transient effects and inhomogeneous shear fields are present. The theory will be applied to predict the dynamics of practical flows such as lab-scale immersed sediment flows and will be refined by comparing the results with experimental measurements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
