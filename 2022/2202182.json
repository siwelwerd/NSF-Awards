 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced manufacturing technician programs provide pathways for students to pursue technical careers in manufacturing companies that are adopting new automation and robotics technologies. The demand for manufacturing technicians in the central Missouri region continues to grow. However, the supply of qualified technicians with skills in advanced manufacturing technologies has not kept pace with this demand. This project addresses the need to increase the number of students entering and successfully completing technician degree and certificate programs in advanced manufacturing. In collaboration with regional industry, the project team will develop a foundational course in advanced manufacturing and revise existing courses in multiple technology degree programs. Students will have the opportunity to obtain nationally recognized certifications. The project will provide rural high school students in the region with new technical education opportunities including new advanced manufacturing courses that can be taken at high schools and hands-on training with new advanced manufacturing equipment. Workshops and mentoring for secondary school teachers will be provided so that teachers can integrate advanced manufacturing concepts in their high school courses. Students from rural areas in central Missouri will have a new pathway to help them pursue a technical career in manufacturing that improves their economic situation.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to increase the number of students in advanced manufacturing technician pathways to meet the demand for skilled technicians in regional industry. This project will: (1) enhance educational certificates and technician degrees that lead to advanced manufacturing technician careers, (2) engage secondary students in activities to raise awareness of technician career opportunities, (3) build capacity for offering dual enrollment courses by training high school teachers, and (4) encourage persistence and completion of educational certificates in advanced manufacturing. Regional industry advisors will provide guidance on which industry certifications are needed by students and which Industry 4.0 concepts and skills should be integrated in the technician degree programs. The project will provide creative hands-on learning opportunities such as summer camps for secondary students to engage them in technical careers. High school teachers will receive training and certifications through workshops that include hands-on training with advanced manufacturing technologies. Dual enrollment courses will be offered by high school teachers to help secondary students enter advanced manufacturing technician pathways. Using institutional data and student surveys, the project team will assess the impact of the project activities on student completion of certifications and the number of students who enter the technician workforce. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
