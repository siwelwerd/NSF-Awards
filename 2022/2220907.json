 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 40th Southeastern-Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations (SEARCDE) will bring together leading experts and junior researchers working in differential equations and related fields. The conference, to be held at North Carolina State University (NCSU) in Raleigh, NC, on November 12-13, 2022, facilitates access for junior researchers in the Southeastern-Atlantic region. It provides a unique experience for the region due to its research focus, size, and location, as well as its strong commitment to building regional research networks and mentoring the next generation of mathematicians who work in differential equations. This conference aims to support the participation of 150 regional researchers, the majority of whom will be graduate students. SEARCDE at NCSU serves a significant educational purpose, by helping to train the scholars of tomorrow in order to increase their future impact as scientists. Moreover, building connections at all levels and across the Southeastern-Atlantic region is crucial for increasing diversity in future hires in academia. The 40th SEARCDE is committed to inclusion and diversity. This year the conference will be held in cooperation with the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM). \r\n\r\nThe 40th SEARCDE will be focused on the following themes: (1) Applications of differential equations, especially to problems in life sciences, (2) Mathematical control and related topics, and (3) Applied analysis of differential equations. The focus on timely, applied topics, such as life sciences, aligns the work of the conference with significant societal needs of broad interest and impact. More information about the conference can be found at https://wp.math.ncsu.edu/searcde2022/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
