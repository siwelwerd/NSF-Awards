 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to significantly improve access to vision care for all Americans via a low-cost vision exam kiosk for supermarkets and pharmacies. A key technical component for reaching commercialization and scalability is the development of a contactless and autonomous eye scanner that accurately measures prescription numbers in under 10 seconds. The kiosk enables retailers that Americans already visit on average 20-30 times per year to offer instant vision exams and reports, eye prescriptions reviewed remotely by physicians, and access to high quality but affordable corrective eyewear. With 175 million Americans benefiting from vision correction, this solution could profoundly impact vision care across all communities. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates the feasibility of a novel contactless eye refractor for use in a self-serve and autonomous vision care station for pharmacies and supermarkets. Eye scanning is done via the photo-refractive principle enabling autonomous ocular refraction in mere seconds. A key issue with leading photo-refractor configurations is the resulting drift stemming from gaze misalignment. Instead of refracting single positions in the visual field, the proposed novel configuration refracts the central and peripheral visual field simultaneously, thus guaranteeing the measurement of foveal refractive error. This novel configuration will use commonly available low-cost components and can be manufactured at a fraction of the cost of commercially autorefractors. A software model of the system will be used to efficiently optimize the configuration, after which the design will be built and tested. A physical model eye will be developed and used for testing to confirm the accuracy at a multitude of gaze angles and to confirm result-decoupling of gaze alignment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
