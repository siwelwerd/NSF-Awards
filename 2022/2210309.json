 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum technology has the potential to provide resource-efficient approaches to computing, communication, and sensing. Two leading platforms for quantum information processing are electron-spin qubits in semiconductors and superconducting circuits. This study aims to couple these two systems together to create a hybrid quantum system consisting of a single electron spin in a cavity which may have diverse applications in fields like metrology and quantum computing. Furthermore, this project aims to broaden participation of underrepresented minorities and improve STEM education by involving high-school summer interns from the Rochester City School District in the proposed research and developing course material on quantum science together with high-school teachers.\r\n\r\nThe research proposed here will explore a new approach for quantum-mechanical interaction between individual electron-spin qubits and superconducting microwave photons, with the goal to establish strong coupling in a spin-cavity QED system. Although coupling between spins and superconducting microwave resonators has previously been demonstrated, the interaction is not strong enough for robust quantum-information-processing applications, including spin-photon state transduction and multi-qubit operations between distant spin qubits. To overcome this challenge, the proposed research will explore a new type of spiral microwave resonator, which is predicted to enable much stronger spin-photon coupling strengths than previous resonators, owing to its high impedance. This proposal aims to verify this prediction by fabricating niobium spiral resonators and integrating them with quantum dot spin-qubit devices. The large spin-photon coupling enabled by this work will pave the way for the realization of long-distance interactions between spins, spin-photon state transduction, and the creation of new hybrid quantum systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
