 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a method for monitoring and evaluating exposure risks from airborne viral contaminants to reduce public health risks from respiratory disease transmission such as COVID-19. The aim of this project is to advance our understanding of how airborne contagions are spread within confined interior spaces through exhaling visualization, to understand transmission and potentially reduce workspace respiratory disease transmission. By developing an anonymized vision-based network, this work provides an effective data-driven method for modeling and analysis of how respiratory behaviors contribute to viral transmission within real-world workspaces. The proposed technology aims to identify potentially effective mitigations to reduce communicable disease costs. The resulting platform will provide real-time analysis and AI-driven feedback for exhaled contagion risks for populated interior spaces in educational settings and new forms of data-driven evaluations of open-air exhale behaviors for high-risk populations in healthcare facilities.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to address the open problem of how to effectively and quantitatively evaluate transmission risks associated with airborne viral contaminants as they are spread through respiratory behaviors within real-world workspaces. While aerosolized viral contaminant transmission is well-studied, idealized models provide a limited effective analysis of the complex interplay between turbulent exhale behaviors, indoor traffic patterns, and environmental factors that contribute to erratic airborne contaminant transmissions. This project will present a stochastic method for modeling the potential transmission of airborne viral contaminants through vision-based analysis of expiratory flows within 3D reconstructed workspaces. Through spectral filtered thermal imaging, we isolate and track exhaled CO2 within the 3-5um spectral range to model exhale behaviors within 3D mapped point-cloud models of interior spaces obtained through networked depth cameras. The innovation in our system is the adoption of the measurements of exhaling flow in open air into a quantitative metric that evaluates flow and volume per exhale and models potential airborne contamination spread, providing a quantitative foundation for measuring and tracking exhale exposure regions. The expected outcome of this project is a platform for data-driven modeling of multi-subject respiratory behavioral analysis for potential contagion exposure mitigation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Through new methods in deep learning generative networks, computer vision, and data-driven clinical diagnostics, we provide a vision-based method for monitoring and measuring unique pulmonary signatures of expiratory airflows. Unlike many existing approaches to pulmonary monitoring that utilize wearable devices to infer breathing behaviors or tube-based solutions such as spirometry or plethysmography, the direct analysis of unimpeded exhaled airflow provides unique insights into natural breathing patterns. Advanced forms of respiratory diagnostics include X-rays, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans; however, these scans have limited availability and result in costly procedures that are warranted when conditions become serious enough to require detailed evaluation. As an alternative to these existing methods, we present a non-contact approach to pulmonary behavioral evaluation aimed at identifying unique characteristics of directly observed expiratory behaviors. Vision-based flow analysis of exhale behaviors introduces contributions that extend typical Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) that require continuous effort, by capturing subtle traits over longer monitoring periods. While our approach does not replicate the measures of theses existing methods, we present a novel approach to capturing personalized airflow pattern profiles that reflect unimpeded natural breathing. Our approach addresses inherent challenges related to vision-based analysis of respiratory behaviors including: visual occlusions, interference from airflow, subject movement, and accuracy of measurements due to distance, depth accuracy, and image resolutions. The proposed method for evaluating pulmonary behavior sits next to existing wearable solutions, tube-based tests, and advanced scans. This provides a practical solution for evaluating pulmonary behaviors within a clinical setting to identify changes in behavior over time, identify abnormalities within normal breathing, and introduce a novel form of effort independent respiratory monitoring. During this project, clinical viability of a diagnostic prototype for the evaluation of expiratory airflow to identify flow rate, volume, and aid in the identification of respiratory abnormalities in unimpeded breathing was verified. The process that underpins our core technical diagnostic is implemented by computing flow, volume, and behavioral profile estimations of exhale flows which are used to train deep neural networks to model and form personalized pulmonary traits. In our research accomplishments, we provide a practical solution that: (1) tracks and extracts exhale flows through thermo-spatial imaging, (2) captures and isolates minute exhale flow behaviors, (3) enables data-driven visual analytics used to evaluate respiratory behaviors as quantitative measurements, and (4) introduces behavioral measurements that can be used to uniquely model different expiratory behaviors to identify abnormalities within monitored respiratory signals. As the outcomes of this project, these contributions form the foundation of a new vision-based respiratory diagnostic that specifically isolates and extracts the unique characteristics of exhale flow patterns for furthering our understanding of respiratory traits. These traits can then be used to train deep learning models for the identification and classification of abnormal breathing behaviors. This presents a novel pulmonary diagnostic that can aid in reducing diagnostic costs and broaden availability of alternative respiratory monitoring technologies.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 05/15/2024<br>\nModified by: Shane&nbsp;M&nbsp;Transue</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2151374/2151374_10832706_1715805381630_outcome_flow--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2151374/2151374_10832706_1715805381630_outcome_flow--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Flow Field Visualization\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2151374/2151374_10832706_1715805381630_outcome_flow--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Flow Field Visualization\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sequence of flow fields representing captured exhale flow behaviors.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shane Transue</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shane&nbsp;M&nbsp;Transue\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Flow Field Visualization</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2151374/2151374_10832706_1715805248487_outcome_signals--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2151374/2151374_10832706_1715805248487_outcome_signals--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Expiratory Signals\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2151374/2151374_10832706_1715805248487_outcome_signals--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Expiratory Signals\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Resulting exhale flow signals generated from captured breathing behaviors computed through flow field analysis.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Shane Transue</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shane&nbsp;M&nbsp;Transue\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Expiratory Signals</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
