Marsh\r\nGeorgetown University\r\n\r\nHow do the seeds of altruism sprout and flourish in a seemingly selfish world? The goal of this research project is to identify pathways in the brain that support altruism, both in the laboratory and in the real world. Altruistic behaviors are those aimed at improving the welfare of others, without regard for any individual benefits. They range from holding open a door, to making charitable gifts, to donating a kidney. Surveys suggest that many people believe humans are fundamentally selfish and incapable of true altruism. Such beliefs reduce trust between people, can harm the well-being of the people who hold them, and damage the social fabric of a community. However, several contrary lines of evidence suggest that altruism is ubiquitous and deeply rooted in our biology. One is the existence of real-world extraordinary altruists, such as kidney donors who donate kidneys to benefit anonymous strangers. In addition, a brain circuit has recently been discovered in animals that is dedicated to calculating the value of choices for others. This research project aims to test the hypothesis that a comparable brain circuit exists in humans, and that activity in this circuit may help explain altruistic choices in the laboratory, as well as real-world altruistic behavior. This project has strong outreach and plans for dissemination of scientific findings to the public and the media. The researchers provide neuroscience research experiences and mentoring for students from underrepresented backgrounds and support their aspirations for STEM careers. The project encourages community altruism, including organ donation through the National Marrow Donor Program. \r\n\r\nTo understand the neural mechanisms underlying altruism, the researchers combine behavioral studies and whole brain neuroimaging (using fMRI \u2013 functional magnetic resonance imaging) in a wide and diverse set of participants, ranging along the \u201ccaring continuum\u201d from altruistic kidney donors to typical adults, to adults who exhibit antisocial, selfish real-world behaviors. Surveys of life experiences are collected to identify formative, developmental events that may shape later altruistic behavior. The variety of subjects in the study enable the researchers to search for differences in patterns of brain activity in altruists compared to antisocial and selfish adults. Neuroimaging measures activity in the hypothesized corticolimbic brain circuit (that includes the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex) and in the rest of the brain. To discover whether altruism can be enhanced, researchers test whether two brief laboratory interventions can increase altruistic behavior in typical adults. These interventions are combined with functional brain imaging so that the neural mechanisms by which these interventions shape altruistic behavior can be identified. Researchers also collect blood samples from all study participants to indirectly measure how variations in the activity of the neurohormone oxytocin correspond to real-world and laboratory altruism. Oxytocin is a neurohormone that has been associated with trust and prosocial behavior, but its effects have not yet been measured in real-world altruists, nor previously correlated with brain activation in the circuit under investigation. This research promises to improve understanding of the ancient neural circuits underlying generosity and altruism, and challenge misconceptions about the human capacity for altruism.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
