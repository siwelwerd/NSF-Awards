 "awd_abstract_narration": "Just a few microseconds after the Big Bang, the Quark-Gluon Plasma permeated our universe. This phase of strongly interacting matter exists under extreme conditions of temperatures or densities, like the ones achieved in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions currently taking place at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), or the ones realized in nature in the core or neutron stars or their mergers. This project will advance our knowledge of hot and dense strongly interacting matter by calculating observables from first principles and relating them to measurements. The PI will investigate effects which, if verified, could change our understanding of the deconfinement phase transition and strongly interacting matter. The high precision now achievable in the theoretical calculations allows such a combined effort between theory and experiment for the first time. The project will contribute to training the next generation of students working on the theory of fundamental interactions, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The PI will promote physics to underrepresented minorities through public lectures, seminars and visits to Houston schools. She will work with associations of underrepresented students to develop a program to recruit undergraduate and graduate students at UH. \r\n \r\nThe purpose of this project is to significantly advance our understanding of strongly interacting matter by means of first principle lattice simulations, complemented by phenomenological approaches, to build a bridge between theory and experiment. The PI plans to achieve this goal by calculating several observables from first principles: conserved charge fluctuations to connect to heavy-ion experiments, Equation of State at finite baryonic and strangeness density for the first time; inclusion of a critical point with the correct features for QCD. The methodology is to calculate relevant observables using numerical simulations from first principles. These observables can then either be directly compared to experimental results from RHIC and the LHC, or they can be used as inputs into phenomenological models for the evolution of heavy-ion collisions or neutron star mergers. Finally, some of them can be used to improve phenomenological models through parameter or interaction constraints. The Quark-Gluon Plasma exhibits several features in common to other strongly interacting systems, such as ultra-cold atom gases in a magneto-optical trap. Thus, the study of hot and dense QCD matter will yield novel insight into a class of physical systems, not limited to the domain of nuclear physics.\r\n\r\nThis project advances the objectives of \"Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics\", one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
