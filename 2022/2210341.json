 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research activities supported by this award are driven by the desire to answer the fundamental question, \"What are the properties of the early universe?\" It is known that hydrogen, helium, and lithium were produced shortly after the Big Bang.  However, theoretical predictions of the amount of helium resulting from the Big Bang are highly dependent on the lifetime of the free neutron. Recent experiments using what is called the \u201cbottle technique\u201d have reached record-breaking precision. Measurements using a different technique differ from the bottle measurements by a surprising amount.  With support from this award, this PI will lead a new measurement of the neutron\u2019s lifetime by  measuring beam neutrons decaying in flight. Another decay experiment using tritium provides a promising way to determine the absolute mass of the nearly-weightless neutrinos. This project precisely measures the cyclotron motion of the electrons emitted when the tritium undergoes beta decay. This provides another key element of Big-Bang nucleosynthesis. Finally, to understand why the Big Bang left the universe with the surplus of matter over antimatter that we observe today, laboratory experiments are in progress to search for a crucial clue, an extremely small separation of the positive and negative electric charges within the neutron. Students with broad backgrounds will be mentored in scientific and technical skills while participating in these research activities. In particular, high school students from less affluent communities surrounding Los Alamos are invited to participate in summer physics camps.\r\n\r\nThe PIs, in the nuclear physics group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, will carry out these research activities in experimental neutron physics and fundamental symmetry tests. The work includes: (1) Continuation of the UCNtau experiment data-taking and analysis, and in parallel, developing the UCNtau+ upgrade to push the neutron lifetime precision towards 0.1 s. (2) Collaboration on the beam-lifetime experiment, by constructing the Alpha-Gamma neutron calibration device, in order to work towards resolving the outstanding 10-second discrepancy between the values of the neutron lifetime measured using the beam and bottle methods. (3) Application of the magneto-gravitational trap, successfully used in the UCNtau experiment, to trap tritium atoms in large numbers in preparation for the measurement the absolute mass of the neutrino in the Project-8 experiment. (4) Preparation of the neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) experiment at LANL to start data-taking in 2023, and continuing construction of the polarized helium-3 system for the nEDM experiment at the Oak Ridge Spallation Neutron Source.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
