 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support wastewater technician training, aligning education to the rural technician needs across Hawai\u2018i and nationwide as the wastewater treatment industry moves towards new and efficient technologies that protect public health and the global environment. Traditional Pacific Island identity is deeply rooted in sustainable water management, and a central focus of this project is to build on the growing unique m\u0101lama \u2018\u0101ina movement in Hawai\u2019i, a culture-based strategy for addressing environmental issues through land stewardship. The project will address the critical technician workforce shortage required to replace 88,000 cesspools with individual wastewater systems (IWS) by 2050, as mandated by the Hawai\u2018i state legislature Act 125. Hawai\u2018i\u2019s cesspools release over 53 million gallons of sewage into the ground daily, threatening public health by contaminating the islands\u2019 groundwater \u2013 the primary source of Hawaii\u2019s drinking water.  Moreover, contaminated groundwater leaches out into the ocean, disrupting coastal ecosystems that are a fundamental part of Hawaiian cultural and economic identity.\r\n\r\nHawai\u2018i Community College (Hawai\u2018i CC) and the University of Hawai\u2019I Maui College (UHMC) will leverage alliances with 16 industry associations, employers and policy advocacy groups, two ATE Centers, and three local and mainland ATE projects with similar foci, to collaboratively develop an Advanced Professional Certificate (30 credit hours) in wastewater management, effectively building and supporting a sustainable talent pipeline in the recession-resilient emerging skilled trades and technology sectors related to Individual Wastewater Systems (IWS). The project will: 1) improve understanding of sustainable wastewater management systems in unique contexts, 2) encourage industry collaboration and engagement in solving wastewater problems, 3) integrate learning approaches that together enhance the existing knowledge base on wastewater management education, 4) increase recruitment, retention, and completion of students from groups underrepresented in wastewater management education programs, including Native Hawaiians, and 5) strengthen the available pool of skilled workers to meet the technical demand for IWS implementation. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
