 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pan-American School on Commutative Algebra is a two week long summer school focusing on a range of topics of current interest in the field. The school will take place on the premises of Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Matem\u00e1ticas in Guanajuato, Mexico, which has a long tradition of successful international events. In addition to introducing active research topics to the participants, another major goal of the school is to foster international connections among the participants. This grant will fund the participation of US-based graduate students to the school.\r\n\r\nA number of significant breakthroughs have occurred in Commutative Algebra in recent years. These results arrived by integrating various techniques in Commutative Algebra and methods from other areas such as number theory, convex geometry, and representation theory. The basic scientific purpose of this school is to connect students with a range of questions and techniques of current interest in Commutative Algebra. Topics for the school include lectures on toric varieties, algebra structures on free resolutions, methods in positive characteristic, and differentials and derivations with applications.  For more information on the summer school, see https://www.jack-jeffries.github.io/PASCA.html.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
