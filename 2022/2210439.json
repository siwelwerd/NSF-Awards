 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in technology have led to an explosion of data being collected in many areas of application. Many of these data have complex structures, in the form of text, images, video, audio, streaming data, etc, for example. This project focuses on one important type of complex data structure, networks, or graphs. Such data are common in diverse engineering and scientific areas, including biology, medicine, sociology, computer science, electrical engineering, economics, and so on. While there has been extensive research on networks, much of it only deals with the presence/absence of pairwise relationships. However, real-world relationships are often more complicated. The current research program aims to go beyond the pairwise presence/absence relationship and develop statistical methods to characterize and model more complex network structures. The research program will make significant contributions in several areas, including Statistics, Biology, Computer Science, Healthcare, Electrical Engineering, Medicine, Physics, Psychology, and Sociology. The investigators plan to train STEM workforce members by mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, developing a new course, and organizing interdisciplinary workshops. The educational program also includes substantial initiatives in maintaining a research group with a significant portion of women and continuing to actively recruit and support a diverse group of students.\r\n\r\nThe research aims to develop new statistical methodologies and associated theory that incorporate higher-order structures into network modeling. Such data structures are becoming increasingly common in various fields. Specifically, the investigators aim to study three different but related problems: a) leveraging subgraphs or higher-order structures in a network and developing new community detection methods for networks with dependent edges; b) developing novel latent space models and theory that accommodate the well-known balance theory, i.e., \"the friend of my friend is my friend\" and \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend,\" for signed networks; c) developing new latent space models and theory for the less studied, though commonly encountered, polyadic relations that involve more than two nodes simultaneously, i.e., hypergraphs, using determinantal point processes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
