 "awd_abstract_narration": "Statistical methods have been a major driving force towards interpretable, actionable, and trustworthy machine learning. However, the existing statistical theory remains highly inadequate in explaining many new phenomena that emerge, and become pervasive in modern machine learning applications. For instance, the prevalence of over-parameterized models (i.e., the ones that have more model parameters than samples) challenges our classical statistical insights about the bias-variance tradeoff; the fact that many learning algorithms exhibit favorable algorithmic regularization to alleviate overfitting is largely beyond the reach of previous statistical literature, and the unconventional shapes of the risk curves in modern applications puzzle many statisticians. Compared to the rich theory developed for classical settings, however, the statistical underpinnings for these curious yet mysterious phenomena remain far from sufficient. Motivated by this, the overarching goal of the project is to enrich the statistical foundation of machine learning by adapting it to contemporary settings, thereby bridging classical statistics and cutting-edge machine learning. In addition, the project will provide valuable opportunities for training students (particularly underrepresented groups) at all levels across multiple disciplines in the STEM field, and will exert scientific and societal impacts on several domains beyond the tasks described herein, including but not limited to neuroscience, online education, and equitable machine learning.\r\n\r\nStriving for interpretability and actionable insights, this project plans to revisit multiple classical statistical problems---ranging from minimum-norm interpolation, risk estimation, cross validation, kernel boosting, data-imbalanced classification, to transfer learning---with an emphasis on unveiling new insights for modern yet under-explored regimes. Several recurring themes include: (i) characterizing precise risk behavior in the face of large model complexity; (ii) reconciling the seemingly conflicting goals of over-parameterization and regularization; (iii) developing algorithm-specific statistical reasoning tools; and (iv) exploring the interplay between regularization and generalization. The project comprises three distinct yet related thrusts: (1) statistical insights for over-parameterization: which explores the prolific interplay between model complexity and out-of-sample performance; (2) algorithmic regularization via early stopping: which aims to develop statistical principles that underlie early stopping; (3) risk (non)-monotonicity with imbalanced data: which is motivated by the non-monotonicity of generalization errors in the sample size and pursues principled debiasing methods to rectify it. The project will develop a suite of statistical insights that can inform cutting-edge machine learning practice, as well as an array of statistical methodologies that will be practically appealing for modern data-driven applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
