 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UCC 2022 and BDCAT 2022 conferences will provide a premier international platform for researchers in both academic and industry to present new discoveries, developments, research results, as well as the latest trends and new challenges in cloud/edge computing, and big-data computing and technologies. The conferences, to be held at the Marriott-Portland Downtown Waterfront in Portland, Oregon, in December 6-9, 2022, is organized by a leading group of experts in cloud computing and big data technologies and will bring together researchers, developers and users from academia, industry, laboratories, and commerce to discuss recent advances and trends in cloud computing and big data technologies.   \r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to fund students\u2019 traveling to participate in the conference to engage deeply with the UCC/BDCAT research community.  The UCC/BDCAT student participation program provides a comprehensive means for students to improve their overall research skills and planning, beyond presenting posters and papers.  The conference will run specific student-centric sessions during the conference, mainly scheduled in parallel or after the end of the regular sessions, including a Doctoral Symposium, and an NSF REU Symposium, which will provide rich opportunities for student attendees to interact with peers and senior researchers. This year for the first time, UCC/BDCAT welcomes the student-focused program, Symposium for Undergraduate Research in Data Science, Systems, and Security (NSF REU Symposium), which will greatly enrich the UCC/BDCAT student programs, bringing undergraduate researchers to the event to present their research work in cloud computing and big data science and technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
