 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal in astronomy is to understand the conditions necessary to form stars. Stars begin their lives in giant, dusty clouds of gas. The Orion Nebula is a spectacular example of such a cloud in which many stars are forming. A particularly interesting star forming region is the Aquila Rift, a massive expanse of dark gas clouds. The Rift is important because no other nebula so large and potentially rich in young stars lies this close to the Sun. For many decades astronomers have been puzzled by the lack of young stars in the Rift because it contains enough gas to form about a hundred thousand Suns. Yet only a few young stars had been identified in the Rift.  One way to find evidence of forming stars is to look for Herbig-Haro (HH) objects- distinct jets of gas that are produced by young stars. A new method has proven successful in finding several dozen new HH objects in the Rift, many in places where none had been seen before. Their discovery shows that many more stars are forming in the Rift than previously thought. The goal of this project is to complete a comprehensive survey of the Rift to better understand the extent of star formation within its clouds. The survey will use the \"Dark Energy\" Camera (DECam) on the Blanco 4-meter telescope at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican observatory, which is operated by NSF's NOIRLab. It is the only telescope in the world that can do this search.\r\n\r\nThis search for HH objects in the Rift will be developed by Dr. Rector into a \"Curriculum for Undergraduate Research Experience\" (CURE). CUREs are an established instructional model that integrates scientific research with education by giving introductory-level undergraduate students an opportunity to do authentic research with real data. Its goals are threefold: (1) to teach that science is a process of discovery, not just a body of knowledge, (2) to improve attitudes towards science and STEM careers, and (3) to develop critical thinking, teamwork and goal-driven work skills important in any career.  Dr. Prato will also mentor her undergraduate students and participate in outreach activities, particularly as a role model to women in science and to girls interested in pursuing science as a career. Prato actively mentors professional junior women at Lowell and NAU. Furthermore, Prato is developing a curriculum for a professional development workshop aimed at providing advanced undergraduates and early-career graduate students with critical professional advice of the type that is not typically taught in class. Prato is also leading a major effort to provide information and resources for high school students in under-resourced communities to pursue secondary STEM education.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
