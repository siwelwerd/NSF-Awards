 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ground based optical observatories require a dark night sky to answer questions about the nature of our universe. However, companies and governments are launching many bright satellites into Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). These \u201cmega constellations\u201d will fundamentally change astronomical observing. Night-time images will have streaks caused by the passage of sun-illuminated satellites. With the planned launch of 100,000 or more of these satellites to orbit the earth, there will be negative impacts on astronomy. Without mitigation in the next decade this will transform ground based optical astronomy. Wide field sky surveys such as Rubin Observatory\u2019s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are most impacted.  The glare from satellite constellations impacts professional and amateur astronomers as well as the general public.  To address these issues, the PI proposes to pursue multiple mitigations that includes working with the team at SpaceX.\r\n\r\nA number of companies and governments are in various stages of planning or deploying bright satellites in Low-Earth Orbit (LEOsats) in greater numbers than ever before. Given that several companies are going ahead with their constellations, an assessment of the science impact and exploration of the effectiveness of several mitigation strategies will be made. Wide-field sky surveys like the Rubin Observatory are most impacted.  The PI will develop novel algorithms for CCD image processing, an advanced strategy for avoiding the brightest LEOsats, a new method of masking LEOsat streaks, on-sky exploration of the effects of LEOsat streaks using Rubin Observatory\u2019s commissioning camera, validation of these mitigation strategies, and full simulations of LSST observing and resulting impact on key science of the residual systematic errors from the millions of LEOsat trails in the data. Outreach efforts to the wider community will involve attendance at SATCON-1, SATCON-2, and Dark & Quiet Skies workshops, as well as presentations at the annual Rubin Observatory Project and Community Workshop\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
