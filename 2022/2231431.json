The meeting will help to (1) showcase the diversity of projects within the CSSI program, specifically with respect to their scientific applications; (2) significantly advance networking among funded CSSI projects; (3) analyze lessons learned pertaining to sustainability of project outcomes and products; (4) identify requirements and leading practices for data integrity and provenance; (5) create vision and identify tangible steps for creating a diverse and inclusive workforce for CI; and (6) develop recommendations for a sustainable organizing committee process and future meeting structures.  \r\n\r\nThe meeting will foster networking and cross-pollination between CSSI and CSSI-related projects and their larger communities to broaden awareness about ongoing developments in this community, identify synergies, catalyze new collaborations, and advance knowledge transfer, coordination, and convergence among these projects. The meeting will serve as a focused forum for PIs to share technical information with each other and NSF Program Officers; to explore innovative topics emerging within software and data infrastructure communities; to discuss emerging best practices and solutions across the supported software and data infrastructure projects; to stimulate thinking on new ways of achieving software and data sustainability; to gather the shared experiences in an online web portal; and to identify ways to increase diversity in the CSSI and broader CI community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
