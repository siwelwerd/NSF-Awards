 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving marginalized students' experiences in STEM education using makerspaces. Makerspaces have been growing in popularity as environments in which students can gain hands-on technical skills in a communal setting, thereby improving their confidence and sense of achievement. When students have control over their learning, it contributes to a sense of inclusion. There is evidence that socially impactful themes may increase enrollment in university STEM programs. A fundamental unresolved issue is to what extent these types of benefits may specifically and positively impact marginalized students. The unresolved nature of this issue stems from contemporary research that suggests makerspaces may sometimes perpetuate disparities among students from underrepresented backgrounds. This project intends to develop makerspace student learning experiences that demonstrate how to maximize positive effects while minimizing the perpetuation of negative effects. These learning experiences will include a new prototype makerspace and new social impact course at the University of Michigan (UM), and a new social impact maker project workshop at MIT. This project will provide recommendations for best practices that universities may adapt to create makerspaces that better support the engagement and education of marginalized students in STEM education.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this work is to create a model and a set of metrics that characterize makerspaces' role in affecting key characteristics that are important for marginalized students, such as engineering identity, sense of belonging, and views on failure. The scope of work covers a four-year, longitudinal study that will track three cohorts (approximately 100 students) at MIT and UM. The project will address three research questions: (1) How does increasing agency in informal makerspace experiences affect marginalized students\u2019 sense of engineering identity, sense of belonging, view of failure, and self-efficacy in engineering? (2) How do informal makerspace experiences compare with formal maker-oriented courses in influencing these factors? (3) How do socially impactful maker projects influence the engagement of marginalized students compared with non-socially impactful projects? Data from quantitative interviews, qualitative interviews, surveys, and guided projects in instrumented makerspaces will be analyzed to answer these questions. Project results will be disseminated via publications and presentations within the American Society for Engineering Education, the International Symposium on Academic Making, and the International Journal of Academic Making and Makerspaces. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
