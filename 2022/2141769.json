 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to improve and broaden participation in undergraduate STEM education through faculty use of student centered pedagogical practices in their teaching that also foster diversity, equity, and inclusion in physics and astronomy.  Most new college and university faculty in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) begin their teaching careers with little or no experience with methods of effective pedagogy, including methods for addressing and improving diversity, equity, and inclusion. To remedy this problem in physics and astronomy, the American Association of Physics Teachers, the American Astronomical Society, and the American Physical Society propose to build on and bolster the successful series of Physics and Astronomy Faculty Workshops. With partners from the University of Virginia, the University of Washington (Bothell), and the University of Arizona, the project will implement a significant redesign of the workshops based on what has been learned from participant feedback, workshop evaluations, research into faculty professional development, and the needs of today\u2019s faculty. Effective practices for enhancing diversity, equity and inclusion will be integrated throughout the workshops. In addition to tenure-track faculty, the project will foster the participation of adjunct, part-time, and primarily instructional faculty, who, collectively, teach an increasing fraction of physics and astronomy courses across the country.  \r\n\r\nThe project redesign will add four new components: (1) a restructured program delivered by a core set of well-prepared presenters, focusing on the development of participants\u2019 Individual Development Plans; (2) an overarching emphasis on the professional development of the \u201cwhole faculty member,\u201d as faculty members grow as educators, researchers, and professionals; (3) an enhanced set of post-workshop activities to provide coaching and feedback for the workshop participants as they implement student-centered instructional practices; and (4) a research program focusing on how faculty develop from novices to reflective practitioners in their role as educators. Despite the successes of the New Faculty Workshops to date, studies show that some faculty members do not persist in implementing those pedagogical practices. The redesigned program will directly address this \"implementation dip\" by developing habits of mind that support resilience, reflection, and continuous improvement of teaching, and engaging faculty in an inclusive community of educators that helps them navigate and integrate student-centered teaching practices throughout their careers.  The research and evaluation are designed to inform the improvement of workshops and post-workshop activities and contribute to an understanding of the role of reflective practice in tackling the implementation gap associated with sustaining student centered pedagogical practice in undergraduate STEM education.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
