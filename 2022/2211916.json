This event will bring together early career researchers and world renowned mathematicians from a variety of fields, including complex analysis, symplectic geometry, differential geometry and partial differential equations. This event will provide a great opportunity for young mathematicians, and mathematicians from under-represented groups to attend the conference and build relationships and collaborations with leaders in a variety of mathematical fields.\r\n\r\nDeformations of geometric structures has been an exceptionally active theme in current developments in mathematics, with an infux of ideas from many independent sources, including algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, partial differential equations, and string theory. The ideas have lead to significant advances in enumerative geometry, Gromov-Witten Theory, symplectic geometry, as well as moduli problems and the discovery of new geometric and topological invariants. The conference will host a wide array of talks from experts in a variety of fields where these ideas have been infuential. Deformations of geometric structures were pioneered by the late Professor Masatake Kuranishi of Columbia University, with his landmark works on locally complete deformations and the many novel techniques which he introduced. The conference website can be found at https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/kuranish-conference/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
