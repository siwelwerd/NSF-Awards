 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support activities to organize and hold a Beacon Satellite Symposium at Boston College from August 1 to 5, 2022. This 5-day conference anticipates 120 participants onsite with 100 oral presentations and a poster session. The Beacon Satellite Symposia are the only long-term international symposia dedicated to studies of satellite signals and the radio propagation effects on applications of societal interests. With space weather a global problem, this symposium can enable international collaborations and partnerships among the stakeholders.  This symposium will provide exposure for students to worldwide research on their topics of interest. It will also provide rare and unique opportunities for US scientists and students to gain a worldwide perspective on the state of the art of research in ionospheric studies and space weather.  A global perspective on these topics can be achieved by engaging scientists and graduate students from all over the world, including developing nations where ionospheric behavior and space weather effects are not well known.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to host an international conference that addresses current topics in ionospheric and space weather research. The technical sessions include studies on Total Electron Content (TEC), ionospheric irregularities and scintillation, monitoring natural hazards from space, polar effects on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), data assimilation modeling, ionosphere-thermosphere modeling and validation, ionospheric effects on satellite-based navigation systems (such as GNSS), radio occultation studies, space weather, machine learning and new techniques.  The Beacon Satellite Symposium is intended to be an in-person meeting. Plans are in place to enable virtual participation.  The symposium will host a special issue of Radio Science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
