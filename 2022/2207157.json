The annual Space Weather Workshop, supported by NOAA, NASA, and NSF, has been our nation\u2019s premier meeting on this topic since 1996. It brings together researchers, infrastructure operators, and policymakers to share actionable information on space weather, whose modeling and prediction remains a current challenge for science and societal resilience. \r\n\r\nThe Space Weather Workshop highlights the remarkably diverse impacts of space weather on today\u2019s technology including electric power systems, communications, navigation, aviation, and spacecraft operations. It explores recent scientific advances in predicting conditions in the space environment and the breadth of space weather research to operations and operations to research opportunities. The workshop promotes undergraduate and graduate student participation in space weather science and gives them insights into our nation\u2019s space weather priorities, thus developing the next generation of space weather professionals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
