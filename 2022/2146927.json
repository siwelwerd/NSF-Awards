 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to understand how video games communicate mental health narratives. It will provide insight into how digital technologies and new media are re-defining knowledge about and experiences of mental health. This study will support health care professionals, players and scholars understanding of the relationship between technology and mental health. It will broaden mental health discussions to include new spaces structured by digital technology and storytelling.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis dissertation research project aims to: (1) explore how mental health is represented and conveyed as meaningful within video games; (2) understand whether and how stories about mental health are taken up, received, and interpreted by those who engage with these games; and (3) articulate how narratives and storytelling may act as sites of power, inequality, and resistance within video game and mental health spaces. Using qualitative interviews and observations with people who play video games, in addition to critical analyses of video game texts, this study will examine how individuals\u2019 understanding of and relationship to mental health shape and are shaped by video game narratives and experiences. This study will contribute to broadened understandings of how everyday interactions with digital technologies participate in knowledge production, specifically around health and mental health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Second, I explore a different set of relationships that participants fashion with digital game characters. I analyze the bonds that participants form with player-characters as separate social actors and find that participants construe the characters they play as experientially similar.
