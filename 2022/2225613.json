 "awd_abstract_narration": "Energetic precipitation that rains down on the atmosphere from space is known to cause a whole host of space weather effects, including damage to low-Earth orbiting spacecraft, location signal disruptions, and danger to trans-polar aircraft and passengers. Additionally, the atmospheric effects of nitric oxides from particle precipitation play a role in our understanding of weather and climate - a topic that is particularly relevant right now. The linkage between space and climate is not well-known. This study aims to investigate this link directly by analyzing data from spacecraft, ground-based instrumentation, and using atmospheric modeling to uncover the cause and effect of particle precipitation on the atmosphere and climate. This proposal involves graduate student training and participation by several early- and mid-career researchers who will benefit from the collaboration in a new direction. Furthermore, the team plans to host a short, virtual seminar series to be advertised to the full community that will illuminate this science topic, highlight the interdisciplinary nature of the work, and discuss new findings.\r\n\r\nEnergetic particle precipitation (EPP) is both a cause and a consequence of a myriad different processes throughout geospace. It is the result of loss mechanisms that occur throughout the inner magnetosphere, contributing to global dynamics of the trapped radiation belt and ring current particle populations. It is also the cause of several effects on the Earth's upper and middle atmosphere, as the energy deposited to these regions create changes in chemical constituents. As such, EPP is a process that crosses the traditionally-defined boundaries between space science and earth science, and has wide-ranging implications on both systems. The research project aims to advance the frontiers of our knowledge on the drivers and effects of EPP on the coupled magnetosphere-atmosphere system. In summary, this project is to quantify the loss that occurs in the magnetospheric particle population through ground- and space-based observations and use that information to assess the effects of that precipitation on the Earth's atmosphere using whole atmosphere modeling. This approach will allow us to advance understanding of this process within the context of the space science and atmospheric science fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
