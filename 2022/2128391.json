NAPS is a student-centric conference bringing together students, faculty, researchers, and industry in the power and energy systems area since its inception in 1969. The purpose of this symposium is to provide a forum for students, faculty, and industrial representatives to discuss research ideas for next-generation power grid technology, and present their research outcomes. The 53rd NAPS will be held at Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, on November, 14-16, 2021. The travel funding for NAPS will support students and early career faculty. Accepted paper and paper presentation will be a pre-requisite to be considered for the travel award. The expected number of awardees is at least 32 to be reimbursed for their travel expenses. Students will compete for Best Paper Award and for a Best Participant Award. In addition to the technical discussions, they will have further social interactions with other attendees. The awardees may also attend the pre-conference tour visiting the Washington on the Brazos, and the post-conference tour at the Smart Grids Control Room Lab located at the Center for Infrastructure Renewal (CIR) at RELLIS campus of Texas A&M University System.\r\n\r\nThe travel funding for NAPS 2021 will enhance the awareness and technical preparedness of students in the area of smart grids. The power engineering community will benefit from this support by receiving an opportunity for presenting and discussing high-quality technical papers and stimulating cutting-edge interactions with industry representatives. Students and early career faculty from minority groups will also be encouraged to apply for this travel grant to be able to participate in this event.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
