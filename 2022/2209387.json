 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2022, Broadening Participation of Groups Underrepresented in Biology. The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The intestines of animals are colonized by diverse communities of microbes that provide vital functions for their animal host, including digestion, immune function, and modulation of behavior. These microbial communities, termed \u201cgut microbiomes\u201d, have been shown to be reliable predictors of host health and disease, often more so than the host\u2019s genome. While significant progress has been made in the understanding of the gut microbiome, a majority of studies have focused on mammal hosts\u2014whereas hosts from other groups, such as fish, reptiles, or insects, have largely been ignored. Sampling a more diverse range of hosts can provide a better understanding of the biological and ecological \u201crules\u201d that govern animal gut microbiomes. This project aims to generate the most comprehensive animal gut microbiome dataset to date, in order to better understand the origins of the gut microbiome and how an animal\u2019s evolutionary past and current ecology impact the community of microbes within their gut. This project also will broaden participation in STEM by connecting postdoctoral scientists with high school students from underrepresented backgrounds to create a mentorship network that will positively impact both current and aspiring scientists. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of this research is to use a massive comparative gut microbiome dataset to build an accurate model of the gut microbiome that accounts for both microbial and host evolution and diversity. Specifically, the project will  1) assess the extent of coevolution between gut microbes and hosts across the animal kingdom, 2) determine the relative contributions of host diet, phylogeny, habitat in shaping animal gut microbiomes, and 3) build a predictive model of the gut microbiome that accounts for both microbial and host diversity. In total, the fellow will collect gut microbiomes samples from 1500 mammalian species, 800 fish species, 500 bird species, 200 reptile species, 180 amphibian species, and 150 insect species, totaling 3300 host species\u2014the largest and most diverse animal gut microbiome collection attempt based on the current literature. The fellow will also be trained in the latest computational and laboratory methods used for generating and analyzing metagenomic data and how to effectively communicate the project results to the public in various mediums. Additionally, the fellow will collaborate with Northwestern campus organizations to recruit underrepresented undergraduates into STEM.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
