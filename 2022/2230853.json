 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a wireless nano-biosensor for detection of live coronavirus particles and potentially other pathogens. Currently, a positive result from an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)- or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based COVID test does not determine if the coronavirus particles are live (infectious) or dead (or neutralized or noninfectious).  The proposed technology is designed to detect interactions of live coronavirus particles with target cells, antibodies, and drugs in real-time. Those with a negative result from the proposed technology have confirmation that they are free of live, infectious coronavirus particles and would not need to quarantine. This technology may provide a tool for effectively combatting the COVID-19 virus and future pandemics/epidemics as well as other infections.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a nano-biosensing methodology for pathogen detection initially focused on SARS COV-II.  The proposed technology integrates a bio-ceramic nanowire/graphene core/shell nanocomposite with a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag on a wireless communication chip surface.  The hardware of the nano-biosensing system is composed of three parts: a radio frequency nano-sensor, a radio frequency reader, and a handheld device or smart phone. The proposed nano-biosensor is made by coating the biosafe nanocomposite on a disposable RFID tag to maximize the sensitivity. Further, nano-biosensors may be integrated to simultaneously detect samples in a multi-well plate, which is versatile and effective in the detection of virus particles, viral antigens, and antibodies, as well as in evaluating virus-neutralizing antibodies and vaccine efficacy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
