 "awd_abstract_narration": "The RADYSIS project prototypes an automated system for dynamically sharing the electromagnetic (radio-frequency) spectrum in defined geographic zones. The system seeks to improve spectrum access for ground-based radio astronomy facilities and for low-earth-orbit-observing passive-sensing satellites. Within a defined zone, the RADYSIS spectrum sharing system dynamically grants spectrum access requests based on the current state of other users, such as their location and operating frequency, in ways that prevent and mitigate interference. Goals of the spectrum sharing system include enabling radio astronomers to make observations outside the bands reserved for passive sensing and protecting earth-observing satellites from increasing interference by terrestrial wireless communications systems. By helping protect passive users, the project supports better scientific return from observatory investments. By advancing the goal of secure, dynamic spectrum sharing between passive and active systems, the project supports the social and economic benefits that come from continued growth in wireless usage. By serving as a pathfinder for the National Radio Dynamic Zone concept, the project delivers lessons learned that can be used to enhance spectrum sharing for other sites and applications. \r\n\r\nThe RADYSIS spectrum sharing system is an enhancement to the Google Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) Spectrum Access System (SAS). The Google CBRS SAS is an operational system currently supporting nationwide spectrum sharing in the 3550 to 3700 MHz band. This team of investigators will enhance the Google CBRS SAS to add protection for earth observation satellites by incorporating a satellite database and a real-time geospatial spectrum sharing capability. The project adds protection for radio astronomy by enhancing the SAS with mechanisms to: interface to the Hat Creek Radio Observatory (HCRO) daily operational planning system; publish radio astronomy observation plans to other users employing a new standard based on the Defense Information Services Agency TARDyS3 specification; rapidly identify interference incidents based on reports from spectrum users and sensor networks; and rapidly mitigate interference using a new automated negotiation service that interacts with federal and non-federal systems. Field tests at HCRO will explore behavior and benefits of the prototype spectrum sharing system for radio astronomy through tests involving the Allen Telescope Array. The field tests will explore behavior and benefits for earth-observing satellites through one of the following methods: collaboration with proposed LEO polar-orbiting cubesats designed to detect 5G/6G transmissions; collaboration with microwave satellites operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; or by deploying microwave sounders on high-altitude aircraft or weather balloons.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
