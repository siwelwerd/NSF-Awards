 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Norfolk State University seeks to increase data scientists in the work force by exposing students from computer science, chemistry, and other STEM disciplines to the study of data science. The Project Investigators will utilize cognitive constructivism learning theory and the Elaboration Theory paired with experiential learning to infuse data science modules into existing curricula. The project has clear metrics and a strong plan for summative and formative evaluation. \r\n \r\nThe project addresses the shortage of data scientists in the workforce by increasing the number of students and faculty exposed to data science. The Project Team is developing and infusing into the curriculum, twenty-four modules into four computer science classes, CS1, CS2, Java Programming and Computer Security I. The infusion is based on cognitive constructivism and Elaboration Learning Theories with experiential learning, approaches which are known to be successful. These courses expose all Computer Science majors to the field of Data Science in CS1, CS2 and Java Programming (all required courses) and expose many students taking cybersecurity to the applicability of machine learning to the field of cybersecurity. To help expose non-Computer Science STEM majors to the field, there are two summer bootcamps for faculty from STEM departments such as Chemistry, Biology, Technology, and Mathematics. These faculty will be exposed to data science, create two modules each for their specific disciplines, and infuse these modules into these courses. To expose students to industry needs and to foster collaboration with industry, nine students will participate in summer internships jointly supervised by industry staff and the Project Investigators.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
