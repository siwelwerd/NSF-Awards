MLSys targets research at the intersection of machine learning and systems, and aims to elicit new connections amongst these fields, including identifying best practices and design principles for learning systems, as well as developing novel learning methods and theory tailored to practical machine learning workflows. Students will benefit from the opportunity to engage in the technical, professional, educational and social exchanges that MLSys fosters. \r\n\r\nGraduate and undergraduate student attendance is vital to the growth of the MLSys community. This grant helps to sustain student participation, particularly those from institutions where travel funds may not otherwise be available. Emphasis will be given to directing support towards underrepresented minorities, including women, African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Native Pacific Islanders. Students  will have the opportunity to interact with mentors and peers of varying gender, ethnicity and background. Support will increase the attendance of talented undergraduate students, attracting them to graduate studies and future research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

MLSys targets research at the intersection of machine learning and systems, and aims to elicit new connections amongst these fields, including identifying best practices and design principles for learning systems, as well as developing novel learning methods and theory tailored to practical machine learning workflows. The MLSys conference serves as an open forum to exchange research results and develop new ideas, as well as an educational platform to expose students to new research methodologies, tools, and infrastructures, and as a social event to network and prepare students as future researchers and leaders. It is becoming a home venue for showcasing exceptional research that occurs at the intersection of systems and machine learning, and for building a community with expertise in both areas to evaluate the work, gaining significant tractions from both academia and industry. Students receiving travel support benefit from the opportunity to engage in the technical, professional, educational and social exchanges that MLSys fosters, including new&nbsp;community building events established in MLSys 2022, such as a new track of tutorials, as well as special programs for student and young professionals to network and connect with career opportunities.
