 "awd_abstract_narration": "Businesses of all types recognize the transformational value of \u201cbig data\u201d in decision making and planning and are facing a growing need to hire employees with data analytic skills. Guided by the expertise of industry leaders in the areas of big data, data science, and data analytics, Los Angeles Harbor College (LAHC) will create two stackable Data Analyst certificates designed to provide technician-level skills for entry-level employment to address the demand for employees with \u201cbig data\u201d skills. Educational pathways will be developed that will integrate several established traditional and non-traditional STEM degrees, such as business, psychology, biology, and education, allowing community college students to acquire a foundation in data analytics, increasing entry level employability, and allowing them to work in sectors with \u201cbig data\u201d needs. In addition to preparing students for technician-level employment, the use of credit-bearing, transferable coursework will allow LAHC to establish a data science transfer pathway to a growing number of baccalaureate institutions offering data science programs.\r\n\r\nThe project will create a Data Analyst certificate designed to provide foundational data science and analysis skills that will increase the employability of any LAHC student. The objectives of the project include: (1) identifying the knowledge and skill set needed for employment in high demand data analytics technician jobs, (2) developing a new industry-focused Data Analyst Certificate using existing, credit-bearing courses to create new, industry-focused STEM pathway for students at LAHC, and (3) recruiting and enrolling current and new students into the program to complete the Data Analyst Certificate. A Data Science Advisory Board will be formed to develop the learning outcomes for the program and to identify internship sites to provide industry-based learning opportunities. To ensure the courses and data analyst technician program objectives and outcomes align with the current need in the industry, a data science analyst skills assessment will be conducted. The evaluation plan will use a mixed methods approach, matching the method to the outcome.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
