 "awd_abstract_narration": "Improved precision in measurement has enabled numerous scientific and technical breakthroughs. For example, increased resolution in timing arising from the development of ultrashort laser pulses has enabled entirely new approaches to study molecular dynamics on short time scales. This project aims at developing experimental methods for the generation, manipulation and measurement of quantum-mechanical states of light and to exploit these for quantum-enhanced sensing under adverse conditions in which optical loss and background noise are present. The project goes beyond prior work by utilizing multiple optical channels, or modes, that can have strong quantum-mechanical correlations, known as entanglement, to both enhance the precision in optical interferometry, but also suppress the contributions of background noise. To diversify, educate and train the upcoming quantum workforce the project will provide a solid background and mentoring in quantum and nonlinear optics for a postdoctoral researcher, graduate student, undergraduate students, as well as related outreach activities. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will focus on the experimental development of multimode squeezed vacuum states generated by pulsed spontaneous parametric down conversion. Two different approaches to detecting the nonclassical light will be developed \u2013 a photon-number-resolving spectrometer and photon-counting sum-frequency generation. The project will explore theoretically the fundamental limits of sensing in realistic settings, where loss, noise and other imperfections arise. Photon addition and subtraction in well-defined temporal modes will be explored as means to boost the performance of quantum sensing protocols. The project results will advance the understanding of the role entanglement in sensing and influence future quantum-enhanced sensing research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
