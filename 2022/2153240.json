 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Seth Cohen of the University of California, San Diego is studying the development of a new class of solid, tunable catalytic materials. Using a combination of phosphorus-derived ligands linked to palladium, rhodium, and iridium metal centers, Professor Cohen and his research team will create new molecular frameworks with potential for catalysis. Modifications to these materials are being explored to determine how to tune them to promote cross-coupling and hydroformylation reactions (carbon monoxide capture and incorporation into useful building blocks) that are important for the manufacture of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and other important products. In addition to these studies, Professor Cohen is supporting undergraduate students from across the University of California system to travel to Washington DC where they can participate in internships at the interface of public policy and science through the Science Policy Internship Program (SPIP), and is simultaneously creating an undergraduate scientific policy course.\r\n\r\nInnovative catalytic materials are essential to keep up with demand for new chemical reactions that produce fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and other important products. This research program is developing a new class of solid-state catalysts for performing high-value chemical transformations. Specifically, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs, a type of porous solid) derived from phosphorus-based ligand frameworks and low oxidation state reactive metals are being investigated. The use of low oxidation state metals as a component of MOFs is uncommon and underdeveloped, but potentially valuable for C-C bond forming reactions.  Both the organic and metal component of the MOF catalysts will  be examined in a modular manner, to investigate structure-function relationships, optimize catalytic activity, and explore opportunities for selectivity.  These studies are designed to determine how low oxidation state, framework materials can serve as modular, next-generation, solid state catalysts. Synergistically, these activities will promote the training of a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students, while also supporting science policy internship program participation for undergraduates and broadening scientific policy discussion through course development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
