 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fundamental goal of this project is to uncover the molecular mechanisms controlling the assembly and organization of the cellular actin cortex. The actin cortex is a thin network of actin filaments and myosin motors coupled to the cell membrane, whose structure and organization regulate cell shape changes during migration, division, and morphogenesis. While the key molecular components of the cortex have been characterized, how they assemble and maintain diverse actin network organizations remain poorly understood. This collaborative project aims to understand the multi-scale dynamics of cortex assembly by integrating new multi-scale modeling tools with in vitro experimental techniques, which will benefit the communities of researchers studying cell biology, biophysics and mechanobiology. This collaboration will provide training in state-of-the-art simulation and experimental techniques to postdocs and students, in multidisciplinary and stimulating environments, where they will collaborate and develop international professional networks. Lessons learnt from this project will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate curriculum in Biophysics developed by the PI, to demonstrate how self-organized biological systems emerge from the interaction between molecular components.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to develop new experimental approaches to manipulate the assembly, turnover, and force generation in reconstituted actin networks. In parallel, the researchers will build a multi-scale model for the cortex, integrating data at the molecular scale to generate predictions at the network scale that will be tested experimentally. Using these tools, the researchers aim to build cortex-like actomyosin networks that can dynamically morph into different organizations. The second aim is to determine how the mechanochemical properties of cortical actin networks can be tuned at the molecular scale to drive transitions between different force-generating actomyosin structures. This project aims to transform the current paradigm by showing that distinct actin networks, rather than being independently built, are mechanically integrated within the cortex and emerge via phase transitions.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative US/France project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche, where NSF funds the US investigator and ANR funds the partners in France.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
