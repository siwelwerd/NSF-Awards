 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2nd Optogenetic Technologies and Applications Conference focuses on a broader range of topics. Highlighting CRISPR and epigenetic applications as well as optogenetics in cell signaling is unique to this conference. The broader range of topics allows the conference to host a group of scientists and engineers with very diverse backgrounds. Hosting this conference for the second time allows students and early career professionals to share their work and learn about new advances in a rapidly growing field. Additionally, hosting the conference again allows continuous growth of members of this community. This growth encourages discussion among normally separated scientists and engineers and encourages collaboration in the field, which is critical to accelerating the development of novel therapeutics. There are dedicated efforts to reach out to students to attend this conference as well.\r\n\r\nOptogenetics is an emerging technique that allows researchers to use light in order to control living cells that have been modified to be light sensitive. Optogenetics has a myriad of applications in fields such as healthcare, energy, and chemical manufacturing. Because of rapid advancements in the field as well as a high potential to be used in industry, the 2nd Optogenetic Technologies and Applications Conference is designed to showcase the novel and cutting-edge research being conducted in the field. The Conference touches on a broad range of topics including advances in fundamental science, applications in cell signaling and epigenetics, and applications to a number of fields including neuroscience, cardiology, control of metabolism, and drug delivery.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
