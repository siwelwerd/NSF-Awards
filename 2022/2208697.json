 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proliferation of plastics, microplastics, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in water, air, and soil poses environmental and health risks. The aim of this project is to use a unique dual-layer approach to create high-barrier biodegradable paper (HB2P) as an alternative to plastics and PFAS-coated paper. The use of innovative dual-layer-coated paper has the potential to offer water and oil resistance, as well as gas and moisture barrier properties for single-use packaging (cups, plates, food wrappers, bags, flexible pouches, and so on), which can be used as alternatives to plastics and PFAS-coated paper in the packaging industry. The designed coated paper is to be biodegradable and can be converted into compost soil under controlled conditions, while being able to readily biodegrade into non-harmful products if it leaks into the environment. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA) of the proposed coated paper will be performed to ensure environmentally responsible and economically feasible solutions. The project will also address several knowledge gaps including those associated with the creation of biodegradable polyester latex without using organic solvents, obtaining high-barrier coated paper that matches or exceeds the performance of conventional high barrier multilayer plastics, and the environmental footprint of high-barrier paper. The results acquired through this work aim to provide foundational knowledge to create data-informed technologies that will promote environmental sustainability. \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives that will be pursued are: Objective 1: Investigate and develop solvent-free methods for creating biodegradable polyester latex. Objective 2: Investigate the impact of biodegradable polyester latex on the development of HB2P via a dual-layer approach. Objective 3: Evaluate the end-of-life scenarios, overall environmental footprint, and economic feasibility of high-barrier biodegradable paper via LCA and TEA and biodegradability studies. This project intends to open and advance new corridors of research in areas such as materials science, biodegradability, paper surface modification, and wood preservation. The intention of the project is to transform the landscape of the packaging sector by enabling a shift away from the existing environmentally harmful single-use plastics and high barrier multilayered structures by offering PFAS-free, compostable, and biodegradable packaging materials. This work has transformative potential for the field of active and smart packaging because dual-layer coatings can potentially accommodate both polar and non- polar active additives as well as low-temperature processing demands. This research offers foundational knowledge for many packaging technologies with applications ranging from paper cups to juice packs and from disposable plates to flexible pouches with a market value of over $300 billion. This project targets strengthening the position of US manufacturers by enabling them to produce sustainable products at competitive prices in the global marketplace. The technologies stemming from this research will have the potential to reduce landfilling/incineration by >20% (32 million tons/year). The microplastic reduction could be much larger than 20% because flexible packaging is the source of 50% of microplastics, and the proposed technology is suitable for this flexible packaging. In addition, the project could help to create PFAS-free single-use packaging paper. Thus, this work will promote the protection of the environment and human health. Graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will gain valuable education, mentoring, and hands-on research experience in materials and environmental sciences. The outreach component of this project includes several STEM-related demonstrations per year for elementary-, middle-, and high-school students, and arranging multiple visits for students to local recycling facilities. A focus will be on inclusion of programs that foster the participation of groups that are typically underrepresented in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
