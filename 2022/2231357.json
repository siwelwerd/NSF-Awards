 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description:\r\nThis project creates a general-purpose, open-access, and programmable quantum network prototype for the quantum information science and engineering (QISE) community to experiment new quantum technologies and train teachers and students of all majors. The developed new knowledge and prototype have the potential to reduce financial costs through software-based rather than hardware-based solutions, support broad and replicable quantum research and education, build an agile, flexible, and scalable quantum network infrastructure for open and equitable access, and help the U.S. out-compete global competitors in QISE. Moreover, the developed prototype is ideal for QISE training and education through its easy access by teachers and students without requiring their prior knowledge of operating complex quantum hardware. A new curriculum based on this prototype will be further created and disseminated through existing partnership programs to train a large body of college students.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nExisting quantum network systems are mostly local, small-scale, and application-specific, reminiscent of the era of the internet onset. The future expansion of quantum networks, without thoughtful planning, would inevitably lead to the same pitfalls as the classical internet like network ossification. In this project, the key applied methodology is virtualization that permits rapid and flexible experimentation of new quantum technologies via agile software controls, without resorting to daunting hardware modifications. To this end, the research team initiates a comprehensive research agenda consisting of three thrusts: (1) the team identifies and re-designs key quantum components, e.g., entangled photon sources and detectors, based on which a software architecture is further developed for the proposed virtual quantum network (VQN) prototype. The goal of this thrust is to lay the foundation and create the \u201cskeleton\u201d for the VQN prototype. (2) The team then develops a suite of protocols to improve the efficiency of the VQN prototype. It includes virtual slice placement and traffic routing for network load balance; queuing users' requests for aggregated service and increased network capacity; and network event, e.g., entanglement purification and swapping, scheduling, and control for high-quality virtual services. This thrust\u2019s goal is to functionalize and create the \u201cflesh and blood\u201d of the VQN prototype. (3) The VQN prototype is implemented in a quantum-network testbed and evaluated against several figures of merit.  Moreover, two Application Programming Interface (API) interfaces are developed to allow nationwide universities to use this platform for replicable research and educational activities. The goal of this thrust is to perform a quantitative assessment on the VQN prototype and create an open and education-friendly platform for the broad QISE community.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
