 "awd_abstract_narration": "The knowledge of fundamental properties of relativistic plasmas under extreme conditions is the window to understanding the basic building blocks of matter, the origins and evolution of the Universe, and the interplay of quantum and classical phenomena. The paradigmatic examples of plasmas in question are the hot primordial plasma in the early Universe, the quark-gluon plasma produced in the Little Bangs of heavy-ion colliders, and the relativistic matter inside and around neutron stars. While some physics properties are understood, there is still much to learn about the relativistic matter. The current project, in particular, focuses on the role of super-strong magnetic fields, which are ubiquitous for many relativistic systems at extreme temperatures and densities. By utilizing a range of theoretical tools and techniques, the PI will investigate the effect of the magnetic field on observable properties and study the possibility of novel quantum phenomena. In addition, the PI will be mentoring undergraduate and graduate students by involving them in work on the project. The PI will also continue organizing and hosting the international online Theoretical Physics Colloquium that features cutting-edge research to a broad worldwide audience. \r\n\r\nThe PI plans to investigate the photon polarization effects, particle emission rates, and other related physics properties of strongly magnetized chiral plasmas. The emphasis will be on physical systems where neither the weak-field limit nor the lowest Landau-level approximation works well. Together with the study of anomalous properties, the PI intends to study collective modes and attempt to generalize the chiral kinetic theory to the case of quantizing magnetic fields. One of the goals of the proposed research activities is to search for signature observable consequences of the chiral anomaly, strong magnetic fields, and related phenomena under extreme conditions. The PI will use the tools of quantum field theory and supplement them with the chiral kinetic theory methods and anomalous chiral hydrodynamics when suitable. The new results about the chiral plasmas in quantizing magnetic fields will be valuable for basic and applied science. The new knowledge will contribute to a better understanding of the physics phenomena in heavy-ion collisions, the observable signatures of compact stars, the plasma dynamics in the pulsar magnetospheres, as well as the evolution of the primordial plasma in the early Universe.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
