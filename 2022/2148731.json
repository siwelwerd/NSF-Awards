 "awd_abstract_narration": "Antarctica habitats are unlike any others found on the planet with extreme combined variations in cold, salinity, moisture content and light availability. Soils and sediments from the Antarctic McMurdo Dry Valley\u2019s region harbor unique microorganisms that can cope with the unique combination of extreme conditions, but specifically how extremophile microbes function or respond to change in these extreme habitats is still largely unknown. This team is utilizing previously collected Antarctic McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) samples to evaluate differences in microbial extremophile function in response to changes in strong salinity gradients caused by warming temperatures.  Comparative analyses of gene expression patterns and secondary metabolite production are being undertaken in lab-based microcosm studies with varying salinities. This work is helping to elucidate the genetic underpinnings for life in Antarctica and show how Antarctic biota evolve and adapt to a changing environment.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the work is showing how environmentally relevant changes in salinity will induce differential expression of secondary metabolites in isolates previously collected from the hypersaline Don Juan Pond in the western end of Wright Valley, Victoria Land in the Dry Valleys region. Transcriptomes of cell cultures under varying salinities are being sequenced and compared to determine significant changes to cellular metabolism, particularly secondary metabolic pathways. Additional previously collected sample types (soils, glacier ice, sediments, and brines) collected from a range of salinities are being used to refine methodologies for future field work and provide training opportunities for students. This program includes a variety of other broader impacts. This project is led by two female PIs, one of whom is a faculty of color, which will broaden the participation of Black women and girls in Antarctic Science. Women and people of color are still underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields, especially in the Geosciences. The program is also designed to provide strong opportunities to integrate STEM research with undergraduate education, especially at Smith College, a predominantly undergraduate women\u2019s institution. At least one graduate student and 4 undergraduates will be involved in the project, and some will participate in presenting results at international meetings. The program is also developing related curriculum in partnership with education specialists to be used with middle school students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
