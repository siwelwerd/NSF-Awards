 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funds for acquisition of a seagoing computed tomography (CT)-scanning system for the Oregon State University Marine Sediment Sampling Facility (MARSSAM), which supports NSF coring programs across the United State Academic Research Fleet (ARF). The system they propose to acquire, a GeoTek Vertical X-ray CT-scanner (VXCT) has a small footprint allowing it to be installed in a containerized lab for deployment aboard many of the ARF platforms. The scanner can collect three-dimensional images at resolutions of between 350 and 30 microns for cores of up to 150 cm in length in a vertical orientation, allowing for preservation of the sediment water interface. Full-length core sections can be scanned in as little as 40 minutes at 64-micron resolution, allowing for data collection at a pace that falls within the flow of core processing aboard the ship\r\n\r\nSeagoing Sediment Core Computed Tomography Scanner\t$611,799\t\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The scanner is managed as part of the inventory of the Marine Rock and Sediment Sampling (MARSSAM) Facility at Oregon State University, and is made available to support NSF research across the US Academic Research Fleet as well as on other platforms utilized for NSF research on a contract basis (e.g., R/V Nathanial B.

The ability to CT scan marine sediment cores immediately upon recovery at sea demonstrably increases the efficiency of field operations, ensuring cored materials capture the environmental, biological, and/or geologic records required to successfully accomplish the funded research. These data sets also inform follow-on study of the recovered cores, allowing for investigation of in-faunal organisms and bioturbation structures, distributions of authigenic sediments, turbidite deposits recording submarine landslides and/or hyperpycnal flows, lamination preservation indicating intervals of benthic hypoxia, ice-rafted debris presence from glacial activity, among many other applications. The seagoing GeoTek CT scanner acquired for this project is a unique resource for US marine geoscience - and was immediately placed in service to NSF-GEO research including projects funded by OCE and OPP in its first year of implementation. The principle investigators supported by the scanner to date, including researchers from Columbia University, University of Florida, University of Texas, Austin, University of Florida, University of South Florida, Oregon State University, University of Washington, University of North Carolina Wilmington, and Louisiana State University have all been strongly positive about the value of the scanner in supporting efficient shipboard and post-cruise research, and the scanner is in (insupportably) heavy demand for use in support of NSF coring cruises in 2024.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/20/2023<br>\nModified by: Maureen&nbsp;H&nbsp;Walczak</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2218189/2218189_10816243_1703053778855_IMG_3288__1_--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2218189/2218189_10816243_1703053778855_IMG_3288__1_--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"MARSSAM CT Scanner\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2218189/2218189_10816243_1703053778855_IMG_3288__1_--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"MARSSAM CT Scanner\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Interior of the MARSSAM laboratory van showing the GeoTek VSCT scanner to the right - as well as the MARSSAM multi-sensor core logger, now co-located in the same van, on the left.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Katherine Stelling</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Maureen&nbsp;H&nbsp;Walczak\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MARSSAM CT Scanner</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2218189/2218189_10816243_1703053694653_Screen_Shot_2023_12_19_at_10.17.33_PM--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2218189/2218189_10816243_1703053694653_Screen_Shot_2023_12_19_at_10.17.33_PM--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"CT Scans from AR2307\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2218189/2218189_10816243_1703053694653_Screen_Shot_2023_12_19_at_10.17.33_PM--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"CT Scans from AR2307\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CT scans of piston core sections collected during NSF cruise AR2307 to the Greenland Margin.
