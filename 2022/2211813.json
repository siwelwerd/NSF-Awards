 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Objective Bayes 2022 Methodology Conference\" will be held at the University of California Santa Cruz, in Santa Cruz, CA, on September 6-10, 2022. Focusing on recent developments in objective Bayes theory, methodology and applications, and related topics, the conference will feature one day of tutorials for new researchers and four days of scientific sessions with discussion and a poster session open to all participants. This conference will bring together experts as well as a group of students and young researchers from a broad set of areas within and related to objective Bayesian methodology. The primary goal is to spark the development of new objective Bayesian techniques, which will serve as invaluable tools in various disciplines that deal with modeling uncertainty such as climatology, economics, and ecology. Emphasis will be placed on the interaction between new and established researchers, and researchers in different methodological areas.\r\n\r\nToday, more than ever, Bayesian approaches have become increasingly widespread. Driven in part by the computing revolution and the need for principled uncertainty quantification, Bayesian methods are being applied widely across the sciences and within industry settings. The conference is aimed to respond to these demands, and will encompass many aspects of objective Bayesian methodology, from theoretical, to applied and computational. The conference will also cover recent developments in areas such as high-dimensional data analysis, approximate Bayesian computation, Bayesian nonparametric, machine learning, etc. For more details about the conference, please see the conference homepage: https://obayes.soe.ucsc.edu.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
