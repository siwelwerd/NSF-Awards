 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel tool to visualize indoor spaces.  Emerging \u201cproperty technology\u201d (PropTech) plays an increasing role in the development of new large commercial buildings; it is anticipated that such PropTech will save billions of dollars per year and stimulate remodeling projects that might not otherwise even be undertaken, once it is made more broadly accessible, and may thus be adopted for the remodeling of small businesses, restaurants, and residences. This project develops a simple, rapid, and affordable generation of accurate floor plans of existing structures, leveraging commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) camera technology (implemented in modern tablets and smartphones) coupled with advanced AI software and algorithms that model and identify common features (walls, doors, windows, furniture) in the 3D images generated by such devices.  The floor plans so generated will provide an accurate, easily generated framework upon which substantial renovations can then be more easily designed.  This is anticipated largely replace the labor-intensive and error-prone manual processes of floor plan generation, thereby reducing operating costs and stimulating new remodeling projects in various markets.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an AI-driven app that quickly and autonomously reconstructs digital spatial layouts of indoor spaces based on walk through calibrated image capture with modern smartphones or tablets, leveraging time-of-flight or structured-light imaging systems together with embedded motion sensors and advanced data analysis. The key intellectual merit of this project is the deep neural networks and optimization algorithms, together with advanced user-interface/user-experience (UI/UX) to provide an intuitive human interface to this data analysis engine.  This enables adjustment of the reconstruction rules and visualization of the generated model. The technical hurdles include accurate 3D scene reconstruction and 2D floor plan generation based on sensor-generated point clouds and feature recognition in cluttered environments, and the synthesis of multi-room maps from several single-room models.  Rules can be specified by the user as appropriate (defining room adjacency, wall thickness, orthogonality assumptions, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

(OpalAi) was awarded a Phase I SBIR grant through the National Science Foundation to develop an AI-driven floorplan reconstruction application that creates spatial layouts of indoor urban spaces. The PI was Dr. Ryan Alimo. The project?s high-level goal is to create a minimum viable product for a floorplan reconstruction app using light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-enabled smartphones and tablets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The main contribution in Phase I was the development of a mobile app, named OpalAi ScanTo3D, that performs a reconstruction of urban spaces, in the form of a 3D digital model and a floorplan, based on a simple walkthrough in a building. ScanTo3D uses the LiDAR sensor to generate a point cloud of the interior space, and AI methods were developed to automatically detect room edges and corners from that point cloud. The project?s intellectual merit contributions include the development and testing of algorithms within the ScanTo3D app that (1) create a 3D mesh of the physical space based on the camera and LiDAR data, (2) add textures to create a 3D scene reconstruction, and (3) identify and label room edges and corners. Testing demonstrated the precision of the approach and technical feasibility for refining the results in a subsequent Phase II project. The process was able to deliver generated floorplans to real-world clients within two days, in comparison to baseline methods that take one month. OpalAi also created a pipeline for synthetic data generation to refine and improve the floorplan reconstruction software.</p>\n<p>The technology to capture a digital representation of building floorplans with a mobile device has strong commercial value. More than 95% of the buildings in the U.S. are missing accurate and updated floorplans. Building information related to the gross living area, organization and layout of rooms and spaces, spatial dimensions, and contents of the rooms is useful in different markets, including architecture, construction, appraisal, inspection interior design, and e-commerce. By the end of Phase I, OpalAi identified overwhelming interest in the ability to generate diverse floorplans and to eventually fully&nbsp;&nbsp;automate the process. Customer interviews identified a need for a scalable and automated approach for creating floorplans or a 3D digital model. An immediate benefit for the target customers would be a 30-fold increase in turnaround time for floorplan generation compared to manual methods, much lower personnel costs, and the elimination of human errors. Eventually, homeowners who are not experts can use their phone to gather information about their property, such as gross living area, and enable remote appraisals and inspections of their home as well as virtual tours.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The research has multiple broader impacts related to commercial need, economic development, building safety, and workforce development. First, ScanTo3D has the potential to increase the economic competitiveness of the U.S. by stimulating remodeling projects in a diverse range of markets that might not otherwise be undertaken due to cost and equipment constraints. The technology uses off-the-shelf camera/LiDAR technology implemented in modern smartphones coupled with advanced AI software. It is anticipated that such solution will save billions of dollars per year. The generated floorplans are the first step in energy efficiency renovations, and by vastly reducing the costs involved, the technology will contribute to improved national building efficiency and accelerated green building transformation, thus helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from industrial, commercial, and public spaces. The product also leads to improved building safety by facilitating data standardization in the U.S. real estate industry. Stakeholders across the real estate sector have disparate needs for data precision and often-misaligned incentives for data accuracy. Developers, architects, contractors, and appraisers all independently collect and store data of differing quality about a building that exhibits little physical change over its lifecycle. Society will benefit from a standardized method for building information that is used by all stakeholders in the real estate field. Finally, the project contributes to the U.S. STEM workforce by providing professional and training opportunities to students specializing in AI and machine learning. So far, OpalAi has provided internship opportunities to more than 10 students at University of California San Diego and University of California Los Angeles.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/10/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Shahrouz&nbsp;R&nbsp;Alimo</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2126752/2126752_10778729_1667951362000_sample-outputs--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2126752/2126752_10778729_1667951362000_sample-outputs--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"ScanTo3D outputs as floorplan and CAD model of buildings\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2126752/2126752_10778729_1667951362000_sample-outputs--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"ScanTo3D outputs as floorplan and CAD model of buildings\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two sample delivered results from the ScanTo3D app. Left is 3D model or 3D point cloud, middle is 2D floorplan or ScanToPlan service, and right shows 3D CAD/BIM or ScanToBIM service.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">OPAL AI INC</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shahrouz&nbsp;R&nbsp;Alimo</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">ScanTo3D outputs as floorplan and CAD model of buildings</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2126752/2126752_10778729_1668122923851_k12-sample--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2126752/2126752_10778729_1668122923851_k12-sample--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"K12 school with an iPad Pro\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/2126752/2126752_10778729_1668122923851_k12-sample--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"K12 school with an iPad Pro\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">K12 School was captured in 2 hours using OpalAi ScanTo3D app and the data was processed to generate 3D CAD/BIM model.
