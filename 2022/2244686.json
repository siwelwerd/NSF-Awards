 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over 55 percent of the energy consumed in the US is released as waste heat. For the manufacturing sector alone, the total unrecovered waste heat is estimated to be 2,500 trillion BTU per year. The waste heat from American automobiles is equivalent to losing over $50 billion each year. Among various waste heat recovery technologies, solid-state thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are a promising strategy to increase energy efficiency, alleviate air pollution, and reduce carbon emissions. Traditional TEG manufacturing includes material synthesis, module assembly, and device integration, which has low productivity and high cost. A widespread deployment of TEGs in existing energy systems can be achieved only by resolving following key challenges in TEG manufacturing: cost-effective synthesis of abundant, low cost, reliable, and high ZT (figure of merit) thermoelectric materials; scalable manufacturing of TEG devices; function graded realization in the temperature gradient environment. This project has an additive manufacturing (AM) based net-shape nanomanufacturing process, that takes the advantages of the latest advances in materials science, heat transfer, and manufacturing, to tackle these challenges. To accomplish this ambitious goal, an interdisciplinary team of energy harvesting, material scientist, heat transfer and manufacturing is assembled at Virginia Tech, Carnegie Mellon, and UW, in collaboration with an industry leader of AM. Students from diverse background will be trained for the twenty-first century workforce. Great efforts will also be made for outreaches to K12 students. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop a novel integrated nanomanufacturing process for high-performance thermoelectric materials and functional devices using the selective laser melting (SLM) based AM method. Furthermore, a correlation between the laser processing variables and thermoelectric material characteristics will be established to provide fundamental understanding of laser-material interactions to achieve a net-shape and scalable AM method for thermoelectric devices. Specifically, the following hypotheses will be tested: (1) The non-equilibrium conditions produced during the laser-based AM process can introduce numerous nano-defects, nanoscale particles, and abundant multi-scale grain boundaries, which can reduce the thermal conductivity dramatically by phonon scatterings. (2) doped Si or other nano-particles will be used as additive materials in the nanomanufacturing process to improve the mechanical properties, enhance the electrical conductivity, and increase the Seebeck coefficient. (3) The laser-based AM can readily realize the graded doping and variable cross-section areas along the length of the thermoelectric elements with temperate variance to make the best use of the temperature-dependent material properties for achieving high performance thermoelectric devices. (4) Using the laser-based AM, the direct manufacturing of thermoelectric materials, thermal insulation layers, electrical conductor layers, and heat exchangers as a functional and integrated energy harvesting system, can result in higher mechanical stability and thermal reliability as compared to the traditional manufacturing approaches. Characterized as low-cost, high-efficiency, and industry-scalable nanomanufacturing of clean energy systems, this technology, if successfully tested and validated, will become extremely attractive for many industries associated with energy and manufacturing systems, such as automobiles, power stations, steel plants and many more. Understanding the fundamentals of electron and phonon transport for thermoelectric materials, developing next generation manufacturing tools, and designing novel heat transfer systems will result in increased efficiency of the energy system and reduced of US dependency on foreign energy sources. The industrial partnership accelerates the assimilation of basic science research into industrial practice.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Researchers at the University of Michigan, led by Dr. Lei Zuo, developed a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model (Fig 1) to simulate how the incident laser may affect the temperature profiles within the molten pool over the Mg<sub>2</sub>Si powder bed with a finite porosity during SLM processing (Fig 2). Through adjustment of the &nbsp;laser power, scanning speed, and layer thickness,&nbsp; optimal laser parameters were identified&nbsp; to obtain thin layers of the Mg<sub>2</sub>Si material with several balling and pinhole defects. A further optimization of the laser parameters was performed utilizing the thermal conductivity value approximations at higher temperatures that led to the printing of Mg<sub>2</sub>Si components with a thickness of ~2mm and 1cm diameter. Although, pinhole defects were still observed because of the Mg vaporization during the laser-material interaction, which seems inevitable. The samples were also characterized to have MgO and elemental Si impurities (Fig 3), which are also common occurrences in the conventionally sintered Mg<sub>2</sub>Si products and form as a result of Mg oxidation at high temperatures. The CFD-simulated laser parameters were found to work well experimentally, indicating the possibility of simulating the actual melt pool dynamics using CFD and approximating the material&rsquo;s thermal properties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The team used phase field modeling to examine how Mg<sub>2</sub>Si alloy&rsquo;s microstructure (Fig 4), specifically its dendritic (snowflake-like) crystal formations may develop during solidification under certain boundary conditions. Faster cooling rates&mdash;achieved by altering scanning speeds&mdash;resulted in finer, and closely spaced dendritic structures which is a characteristic obtained from high cooling rates. Further, solute enrichment within the interdendritic spacing was also indicated by the model, which could be correlated to the elemental Si observed from the phase characterization of the fabricated components. The study also delved into the role of anisotropy and slight perturbations at the interface between solid and liquid phases, which help refine the microstructure to boost stability and performance. Overall, the project successfully optimized the SLM process for Mg<sub>2</sub>Si, demonstrating that additive manufacturing can yield high-quality thermoelectric materials with higher level of process optimization. This innovation provides valuable insights into manufacturability of materials for efficient waste heat recovery devices for various industrial applications, promoting greater energy efficiency and sustainability.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 01/25/2025<br>\nModified by: Lei&nbsp;Zuo</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2244686/2244686_10612978_1737860026413_SLM_TEG_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2244686/2244686_10612978_1737860026413_SLM_TEG_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2244686/2244686_10612978_1737860026413_SLM_TEG_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Layer-by-layer powder bed fusion results in dense components.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lei Zuo, Gagan Kumar Goyal, Haozheng Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lei&nbsp;Zuo\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2244686/2244686_10612978_1737860069478_SLM_TEG_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2244686/2244686_10612978_1737860069478_SLM_TEG_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2244686/2244686_10612978_1737860069478_SLM_TEG_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Visible spatter of Mg2Si during the print, LEFT- Initial layers of the printing process; RIGHT - Progressed stage of the printing process showing spattered powder at the edges of the powder bed.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lei Zuo, Gagan Kumar Goyal, Haozheng Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lei&nbsp;Zuo\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2244686/2244686_10612978_1737860606989_SLM_TEG_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2244686/2244686_10612978_1737860606989_SLM_TEG_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2244686/2244686_10612978_1737860606989_SLM_TEG_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">XRD comparison of the precursor powder and the printed Mg 2 Si material with laser\r\nparameters - Q = 12.5W; U b = 0.05 m/s.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lei Zuo, Gagan Kumar Goyal, Haozheng Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lei&nbsp;Zuo\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2244686/2244686_10612978_1737860711222_SLM_TEG_Fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2244686/2244686_10612978_1737860711222_SLM_TEG_Fig4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/2244686/2244686_10612978_1737860711222_SLM_TEG_Fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Microstructure variation with changing scanning speed (t=0.038ms) modeled within a 10\ufffd10\ufffdm domain with 1118\ufffd1118 mesh elements.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lei Zuo, Jagannath Suresh, Gagan Kumar Goyal, Haozheng Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lei&nbsp;Zuo\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
