 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation grant supports the purchase of an X-ray tomography scanner. X-ray tomography has revolutionized the medical field, providing three dimensional reconstructions of our bodies without the need for invasive surgeries. This same technique is now being applied to the study of biological, geological, and manufactured materials. Cutting-edge research using X-ray tomography can non-destructively image the interior structure of samples with micro-scale resolution, and these reconstructions are opening research opportunities in reconstructing the fossil history of life on Earth, characterizing samples that can provide deeper insight into records of climate change, and developing new lightweight manufactured materials and new generations of electronics. There are currently no X-ray micro tomography scanners at University of New Mexico, thus this instrument will modernize sample characterization in working groups across both the main and satellite campuses. These capabilities will further promote research and collaboration across disciplines, expanding the impact of university research within the academic and broader community.  \r\n\r\nMicro X-ray computed tomography (MicroXCT) scanners map differences in X-ray attenuation as specimens rotate to generate 3D reconstructions, non-destructively revealing intact internal structures and morphologies. 3D quantification enables discovery of morphological relationships that are not visible in 2D, virtual dissections, and digital archiving of research samples. This proposal supports the acquisition of a Zeiss Xradia Context System that is capable of 3D reconstructions relevant to diverse fields of study, with a 30-160 kV X-ray source and maximum spatial resolution of 0.95 \u00b5m for the smallest samples. We are specifically focusing on the Zeiss-Xradia Context System due to its versatility and upgradability for future applications. The system is upgradable to an Xradia 510 Versa X-ray microscope to leverage Resolution at a Distance technology for the maximum performance tomographic imaging of samples within in situ chambers, provide diffraction and phase contrast imaging. In addition to transforming research on campus, acquisition of a MicroXCT scanner would expand educational and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students through direct participation in sample processing and analysis, as well as development of teaching materials for classroom and laboratory exercises.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
