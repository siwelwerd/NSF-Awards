 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2023 Gordon Research Conference and associated Gordon Research Seminar on the topic of Micro and Nanoscale Phase Change Phenomena is the fourth such Gordon Conference and will be held in Renaissance Tuscany Il Ciocco, Lucca Italy. The conference program features a diverse group of speakers and discussion leaders from institutions and organizations worldwide, with talks that concentrate on the latest developments in the field and define its most promising future directions. The technological and societal impacts include advances in thermal management of electronic devices and spacecraft, micro- and nanoscale manufacturing, water desalination, thermoelectric and nuclear power generation, and energy harvesting. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will have many opportunities to interact informally with the leaders of the research community during the conference. Early-career researchers will also be able to present their work, interact with each other, and participate in mentoring activities during the associated Gordon Research Seminar, organized and run entirely by students and postdocs. Topics on overcoming barriers to inclusivity will be discussed during the \u201cPower Hour\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe conference topics reflect the breadth of fundamental research in the field of micro and nanoscale phase change phenomena with emphasis on connections between experimental studies, models, and simulations of processes such as evaporation, condensation, solidification, and adsorption. The design and optimization of structured and patterned surfaces for enhancement of heat transfer in cooling systems and for prevention of ice formation, will be discussed. Gordon Research Conference policies require that all work presented at the conference is recent and at least a significant part of it is unpublished, thus making sure that the meeting will focus on the cutting-edge research developments. The conference is the fourth one in the series and will build upon the successes of the previous three meetings by enhancing the depth and breadth of the discussions of topics introduced at previous conferences while also adding a number of new research areas. Of particular interest will be applying recent advances in multiscale modeling, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and metrology techniques to the study of phase change phenomena at the micro- and nanoscale. Emergent research areas in need of investment in research funding will be discussed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
