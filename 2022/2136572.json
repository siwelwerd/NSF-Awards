 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve the treatment and cognitive function of epilepsy patients by using eye-tracking measurements to detect seizures, neurocognitive symptoms associated with epilepsy, and side effects of anti-epilepsy drugs. Epilepsy results in an estimated $28 B in direct costs annually in the U.S. and affects the quality of life of patients and their caregivers.  The proposed eye tracking technology paired with seizure detection and cognition monitoring modules will have a positive economic and societal impact. For example, some patients with epilepsy may be able to return to work sooner, and the burden on caregivers to monitor seizures and side effects may be reduced. Earlier identification of co-morbidities can enable simple interventions, such as additional support in classrooms, to improve long-term outcomes. In addition, the technology will help clinicians diagnose and refer drug-resistant patients to specialized epilepsy centers, much sooner than the current average time of 18 years. Finally, the solution will improve side effect monitoring in clinical trials for new antiepileptic drugs and help optimize dose recommendations. These advances in turn will accelerate the development of new anti-epileptic therapies. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to improve the lives of epilepsy patients by using passive observation of eye movements in a naturalistic setting to objectively and reliably identify seizures and monitor neurocognitive symptoms and drug side effects. The proposed solution will use a wearable device to collect eye movement data over time, and this data will be analyzed to quantify changes associated with impairments in cognitive functions like attention and reading speed. This data then will be used to develop a personalized therapy response profile to assist clinicians in managing epilepsy. The goal of this NSF Phase I project is to determine whether non-seizure, spontaneous eye movement data can provide insight into clinical features, including the improvement or worsening of seizures and possible antiepileptic drug side effects. This project will advance a comparison of passive eye tracking data to gold standard neuropsychiatric assessments over time and as medication adjustments are made.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
