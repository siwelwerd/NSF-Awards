 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to intercepting landfill-destined carbon fiber \u2013 designated as off-spec fibers - and repurpose it into sustainable nonwoven fabrics. Off-spec carbon fiber constitutes 30% of carbon fiber production. These sustainable fabrics will be categorized based on their performance characteristics into multiple tiers that are suitable for different scales of applications. In addition, this project will explore the hybridization of natural fiber and off-spec carbon fiber for increased sustainability. The results of this project may serve as a baseline for industry to adopt these fabrics into their composites to create lighter automotive vehicles with lower emissions. The advanced composites made from the resulting fabrics may introduce new, high-performance materials that can be used for the development of medical devices, lightweight unmanned aircrafts, and electronic enclosures with applications in the automotive, aerospace, sporting, and marine industries, and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe proposed innovation to produce nonwoven fabrics from off-spec carbon fiber is based on the fundamental studies of their physical and chemical properties and their responses to mechanical agitation and suspension in an aqueous solutions. This effort focuses on dispersing mechanisms for the wet laid process. This technology may lead to a mathematical model that can receive inputs about fibers properties and predict a mixing regime that will provide dispersion conditions for an optimal nonwoven fabric. Such models can be supported with thorough, standardized, quality control and mechanical testing. This project objectives are to establish process to fabricate mats using off-spec materials, including trims, and recycled fibers and to optimize operations for mats made from different combinations of blended carbon fiber tiers. Mixtures of different fractional percentages and types of on- and off-spec carbon fibers will be used, and models will be adjusted to reflect optimal operational settings.  Finally, the team will compare the performance of tailored mixed-material carbon fiber mats against those produced using only carbon fibers to expand products applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
