 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF INCLUDES National Data Science Alliance (NDSA) is designed to increase the number of Black people who earn data science credentials, such as undergraduate, graduate, and post-baccalaureate minors, certificates, and degrees. On average, Blacks comprise about 3% of all data science professionals, demonstrating the need for an Alliance-scale effort to address this STEM broadening participation challenge. Also central to NDSA goals is expanding data science research that advocates for social justice and transforming data science discoveries into tangible benefits that advance equity for all. The potential for the perpetuation of harm through biased data technologies and algorithms is well documented. The NDSA establishes a national network of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) with industry, government, and academic collaborations to apply an equity-centered, collective approach to increase the number of Black data science professionals and eliminate harmful biases in data-driven models. The proposal involves three HBCUs, organized into regional hubs: Clark Atlanta University, Fisk University and Howard University.\r\n\r\nThe NDSA is engaging over 1,000 HBCU faculty, staff, and administrative leaders in targeted efforts that create equity-based data science ecosystems where all students can thrive. The project aims to produce at least 20,000 Black students with data science credentials. The NDSA pursues four mutually reinforcing goals: (1) expand academic and research opportunities that engage HBCU students in data science; (2) develop research in data science that reduces bias and promotes ethics, fairness, and validity; (3) foster the growth of sustainable institutional capacity in data science at HBCUs; and (4) champion evidence-based inclusive practices and strategies that broaden the participation of HBCUs in data science. The NDSA leverages Participatory Action Research (PAR) through faculty/staff workshops, curriculum development workgroups, and research affinity cohorts. Project outcomes are expected to significantly diversify the data-capable workforce and result in societal impact for the benefit of the entire nation. \r\n\r\nThis Alliance is funded by NSF Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES), a comprehensive national initiative to enhance U.S. leadership in discoveries and innovations by focusing on diversity, inclusion and broadening participation in STEM at scale. The Alliance is also funded by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities \u2013 Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), which provides awards to strengthen STEM undergraduate education and research at HBCUs, and the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program, which assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
