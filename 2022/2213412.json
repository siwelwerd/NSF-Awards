 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Description\r\nThe so-called quantum materials including \u201crare-earth-based\u201d materials possess unique properties for critical roles in important technologies like high-speed computation, clean energy, automotive, and defense industries. It is therefore important to clearly understand the key properties of these materials in order to harness them for the various applications. This project enables targeted design of rare-earth kagome materials with multiple functionalities. Beyond the exciting opportunity for a fundamental impact on a rapidly emerging international scientific and industrial field, this research also establishes and sustains a multidisciplinary, team-oriented problem-solving learning environment for students. This research provides the opportunity for hands-on research experiences, particularly for underrepresented minorities, women, and first-generation College students at SUNY College at Buffalo with a large percentage of these underserved students.   \r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nUnderstanding the interplay between topology, magnetism, and correlation is emergent research that can potentially find exotic topological rare earth materials with anomalous topological Hall effect, Chern topological magnetism, and unusual pressure-induced topological phase transitions. The research focuses on (i) discovering new magnetically inspired topological phases by carrier-tunability via the design and synthesis of 4f -based systems and (ii) revealing the role of defects, structural and compositional variations in the electronic structures of the proposed materials with an emphasis on unique magneto-transport, anomalous and quantum Hall effect, and evolution of electronic structures with temperature, pressure, and magnetic phases. This research involves synthesis of bulk single-crystalline materials, then their crystallographic, magnetic, electrical, thermodynamic, microstructural, and spectroscopic characterization. This proposed research and education activities also provide an excellent opportunity to recruit and retain students for the future STEM workforce, particularly underrepresented minorities, women, and first-generation college students. The project aims to train at least five undergraduate students and prepare and refine activities for K-12 students during the funding period.  Proposed activities create great opportunities for STEM students to pursue ground-breaking pathways in their careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
