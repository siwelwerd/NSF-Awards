 "awd_abstract_narration": "Yellowstone is one of the most geologically dynamic places on Earth, and its active volcanism, recent glaciation and ongoing hydrothermal activity provide unparalleled opportunities for scientific discovery. Interactions and feedbacks between geology, glaciation, and climate have long shaped the biologic history of Yellowstone, but the relative influence of climatic and geologic processes through time remains unclear. This investigation seeks to better understand the history of Yellowstone\u2019s geyser basins using an interdisciplinary approach to examine lake-sediment records and test hypotheses about past hydrothermal activity and environmental change. The project will include training for students and a postdoctoral research and collaboration with Yellowstone National Park to develop educational materials for public audiences.\r\n\r\nThe study has three major objectives that focus on the sedimentary analysis of small lakes within and near the Yellowstone\u2019s Lower Geyser Basin:  (1) develop a millennial-scale history of hydrothermal activity in Yellowstone for the first time activity (from lithology, geochemistry and diatoms); (2) evaluate the relationship between climate change\u2014occurring over multiple timescales\u2014and past hydrothermal activity, specifically investigating the hypothesis that hydrothermal systems are sensitive to periods of drought (from stable isotopic records and paleoclimate model simulations); and (3) examine the ecological consequences of past hydrothermal activity in a setting where hydrothermal landscapes create unique vegetation communities at present (from pollen, plant macrofossils and charcoal). Unraveling these connections will increase our understanding of past geo-ecosystem interactions in hydrothermal settings in Yellowstone and around the world and help build a framework for evaluating the paleobiological consequences of volcanic-driven events in deep time. The findings will also assess the sensitivity of Yellowstone\u2019s geyser basins to changes in climate in the past as well as the future. The project will develop new formal and informal educational materials designed to inspire students and inform diverse public audiences\u2014a primary mission goal for Yellowstone.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
