 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this STTR Phase I project is to develop an environmental remediation platform for oil spills and related contaminants in water bodies.  Oil spills and associated heavy metals/toxins have significant economic, social, and environmental adverse impacts. The current state-of-the-art approaches are expensive, pose dangers to marine life, and/or generate physical waste. This project introduces a widely deployable sponge technology that attracts oil and resists water.  It can selectively remove and recover oil from an oil/water mixture and is re-usable. The materials/methods in the proposed project are cost-effective, scalable, and ecologically friendly. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed project is to advance a technology leveraging the interfacial tension at an oil-water interface.  This project develops a nanotechnology-based simple and scalable sponge that can selectively sequester oil molecules and metal toxins from an oil-water interface. The proposed system coats commercially available sponges with a nanocomposite material.  Activities include optimization of key factors affecting interactions between oil and metal toxins with nanocomposites coated on sponge pores and tailoring both the length-scale and chemical architecture for remediation applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The current state-of-the-art approaches to clean oil spills are expensive, increase carbon footprint, pose danger to marine life, and generate a lot of physical waste. NSF Phase I STTR project demonstrated a novel oil spill remediation solution in the form of a sponge, that is more efficient, economic, and eco-friendly than the current approaches. Named as OHM sponge, it can be used to remove and recover oil from oil contaminated water. OHM sponge can be made by coating thin layer of OHM nanocomposite on any commercially available sponge, such as polyurethane. It can selectively absorb oil over 25-30 times its own weight, be squeezed out, and be reused dozens of times. The recovery of oil and reusability of the sponge significantly improves the oil clean-up efficiency and reduces the oil clean-up cost. The materials/methods for OHM sponge are cost-effective, scalable, and eco-friendly. The NSF STTR Phase I steps were addressed towards:</p>\n<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enhancing the oil absorption efficiency of OHM sponge by optimizing multiple development factors such as coating composition, thickness, and formulation.</p>\n<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Utilize complementary surface chemistry to achieve strong binding of OHM nanocomposite coating with the sponge substrate.</p>\n<p>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expanding the application of OHM sponge to produced water treatment and heavy metal removal.

To improve its life cycle, OHM nanocomposite coating was made more stable by adding a chemical treatment stage during the coating step. This helped create a strong bond between the coating and sponge surface at same time without any compromise on the performance. Expanding the application beyond oil spill clean-up, a different formulation of OHM sponge, named as OHM media, was developed. While OHM sponge is useful in cases where oil is floating on the water, the OHM media can be used where oil is mixed throughout in water (oil/water emulsion). This is particularly useful for industrial wastewater/produced water treatment.
