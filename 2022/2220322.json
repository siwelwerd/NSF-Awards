 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support of the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) Drs. Michael Young of Carnegie Mellon University, Pamela Harris of Williams College, Jennifer Ross and Moses Ntam of Tuskegee University and Tera Jordan of the Iowa State University form the core leadership team that will provide mentorship and other support to the first two cohorts of the MPS-Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellows. The MPS-Ascend funding mechanism (NSF 21-573 and NSF 22-501) is intended to recognize beginning investigators of significant potential and provide them with experience in research that will broaden perspectives, facilitate interdisciplinary interactions, and help broadening participation within MPS fields. The purpose of the MPS-Ascend External Mentorship program is to support these postdoctoral Fellows who will broaden the participation of groups that are underrepresented in MPS fields in the U.S. including Blacks or African Americans, Hispanics, Latinos, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and other Native Pacific Islanders. This team will develop a network of mentors and sponsors who will enhance the Fellows\u2019 professional preparation and equip them for leadership roles as equity-focused scholars. The community will function using a layered mentor approach that connects the fellows with one-on-one, peer, and volunteer expert mentors. Through professional development and learning activities, as well as interaction with mentors, the Fellows will be prepared for career success.\r\n\r\nThis effort will bring together a diverse group of educators with experience in math and physical sciences (MPS) as well as social sciences to provide MPS postdoctoral fellows with mentoring experiences that will strengthen their career preparation. The knowledge gained through this project will help to contribute to higher education and science literature regarding promising practices related to preparing postdoctoral fellows for successful professional experiences and seamless transition into the academic arena. This project will develop future faculty and industry leaders who will understand the importance of providing holistic mentoring to support postdoctoral fellows. The planned professional experiences of the postdoctoral fellows will equip them to interact with people from all backgrounds and contribute to broadening the participation of individuals from historically underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
