 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an affordable, accurate, and reliable technology that will provide a unified solution to track a bike location. This technology may reduce the costs associated with two million stolen bikes each year. It may  also aid in detecting accidents promptly which is vital in providing trauma treatments, as well as the prevention of fatal injuries. The development of this new US technology may directly impact public health, insurance companies, and the community by improving the safety of bicycle riders and reducing the economic burden of bike accidents and theft.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of an accurate, versatile, and affordable bike location tracking, accident detection, and vital sign measurement system utilizing a variety of sensors on an internet-of-things (IoT)-based platform. The system is connected to the cloud via cellular services and sends real-time data that is acquired by the sensors to the cloud. The technology utilizes a novel algorithm to detect bike accidents and vital signs. The algorithm gathers data from the sensors, performs feature extraction, and applies machine learning algorithms to detect accidents and measure vital signs. In addition, the technology utilizes GPS location tracking to locate the exact location of the bike and sends the location to an emergency contact in case of an accident so that the rider can receive needed help as quickly as possible. The location tracking system also helps in locating stolen/lost bikes. The biosensors mounted on the bike handle can measure the rider's vital signs, such as heart rate and blood oxygen level, and provide information for activity tracking, as well as detect arrhythmia or heart failure.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
