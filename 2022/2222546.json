 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). \r\n\r\nThis project addresses the need to increase the success of students of low socio-economic status (SES) who participate in undergraduate research experiences in life sciences. The research focuses on students\u2019 academic success and interest, satisfaction, motivation, and persistence in science. To create more inclusive research opportunities for low SES students, the specific aspects of research experiences that may negatively or positively impact low SES student researchers need to be better defined and understood. Therefore, this project aims to use interview and survey methods to identify factors that impact low-SES student researchers at universities nationwide and to understand how these factors impact these early career scholars\u2019 sense of belonging and integration into scientific fields. This project will result in evidence-based training resources to help research mentors create more inclusive and equitable research opportunities for low-SES students, ultimately supporting low-SES students in persisting and succeeding in science. Additionally, this project will support the training in research and teaching of an aspiring tenure-track biology education researcher. \r\n\r\nThis project employs a sequential mixed-methods study design, which will inform the development of resources for mentors of low socioeconomic undergraduate life sciences students. To identify the factors that undermine and support low-SES undergraduates across multiple research contexts, the investigator will interview low SES student researchers in field, bench, and computer-based research apprenticeships as well as Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences. A nationwide survey will then be employed to examine the prevalence of these factors and assess how they impact low SES students\u2019 integration into science and their sense of belonging. The investigator will use these findings to inform the development of evidence-based training resources to provide mentors with tools to support low SES students. While much research on low SES students is deficit-based, this research will instead be conducted with consideration to the structural barriers higher education poses to this population. This study is guided by the social psychology theoretical frameworks of concealable stigmatized identity and background-specific strengths. \r\n\r\nThe project responds to the STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) program that aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied research that advances knowledge within the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
