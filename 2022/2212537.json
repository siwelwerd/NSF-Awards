 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project concerns the modular compilation of a class of powerful,\r\nmathematically based programming languages -- \"higher-order functional\r\nprogramming languages.\"  Owing to their expressive power, these high-level\r\nlanguages are great for programmers, but difficult to implement efficiently.\r\nThe project's impacts are to make it possible for programmers to write software\r\nthat is more robust, more secure, easier to reason about, and with fewer bugs,\r\neven in application arenas where high performance is necessary. The project's\r\nnovelties are two: its use of an annotated intermediate representation, called\r\n3CPS, that allows \"facts\" determined by program analysis and \"decisions\"\r\ndetermined by optimization policies to be associated with the program's\r\nrepresentation; and a suite of higher-order control-flow analyses designed to\r\ndirect transformations on programs in the 3CPS form. The goal of the work is to\r\ndevelop the architecture of a compiler that has higher-order flow analysis at\r\nits center -- to explore the transformations and optimizations that are enabled\r\nby this combination of reasoning engine and code representation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important classes of fact annotations is explicit information\r\nabout the environment structure required to manage bindings of variables; this\r\nis designed to be closely connected to the run-time machine resources needed\r\nfor these bindings (heap records, stack frames and registers). This information\r\nis key to mapping the source language efficiently onto these resources. The\r\n3CPS intermediate form is unusual as an intermediate representation in that,\r\nwhile it has direct connections to the target machine's hardware resources, it\r\nremains a higher-order, lambda-calculus representation. In particular, such a\r\ndesign enables specialized representations of environment structure, such as\r\ndisplays; specializing function linkages on a per-call basis; and the ability\r\nto bind variables and allocate functions in the registers or on the stack.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
