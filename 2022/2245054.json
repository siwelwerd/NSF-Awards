 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ramsey Theory is a central area of mathematics aptly characterized by Motzkin's motto, \"Complete disorder is impossible.\"  Ramsey's Theorem states that given any coloring of all pairs of natural numbers into finitely many colors, there is an infinite subset in which all pairs have the same color.  Since its inception, Ramsey theory has developed in multiple directions, often appearing as the core content in solutions to deep problems from a wide range of mathematical disciplines.  This project utilizes techniques in mathematical logic to more fully develop Ramsey theory of infinite relational structures.  A major motivation is to find dividing lines between those infinite structures which act like the natural numbers in the sense of possessing analogues of Ramsey's theorem, and those which do not.  Of particular interest is the advancement of Ramsey theory for structures with forbidden configurations.  Progress on infinite structures works in tandem with progress in mathematical logic and topology, creating new pathways between several areas of mathematics.  This project includes some important questions which are suitable for graduate students and early career researchers, thus providing opportunities to broaden participation of well-trained mathematicians via the PI's mentoring.\r\n\r\nThis research program will develop the Ramsey theory of infinite relational structures, especially those with forbidden configurations, an area which had been largely impervious to investigations prior to the PI's recent solution for the universal homogeneous triangle-free graph.  This will involve constructing new types of trees which code homogeneous relational structures and using the technique of forcing to produce (in ZFC) Ramsey theorems for these classes of trees.  These new techniques will be used obtain better bounds for finite structural Ramsey theory.  Computability theoretic strengths of varying Ramsey statements, and connections with classification schemes in model theory will be investigated.  Infinitary Ramsey theory will continue to be developed with a broad spectrum of implications for and applications to other areas of mathematics.  The techniques developed, involving simultaneous uses of logic, combinatorics and topology, will create new pathways between these areas of mathematics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Since its inception, Ramsey theory has developed in multiple directions, often appearing as the core content in solutions to deep problems from a wide range of mathematical disciplines.\n\n\nExact analogues of Ramsey's theorem for infinite structures usually fail. The first instance of this was Sierpinski's example of a coloring of pairs of rationals such that every subcopy of the rationals retains both colors. The area of big Ramsey degrees seeks to answer the following questions: 1) Given an infinite structure S and a finite substructure A of S, is there a finite number n(A) such that for any coloring of all copies of A in S into finitely many colors, there is an isomorphic substructure S' of S in which all copies of A have no more than n(A) colors? 2) If yes, find or characterize the smallest such n(A), which is called the \"big Ramsey degree of A\". The big Ramsey degrees of the rationals (Laver, D. Devlin), and the Rado graph (Laflamme-Sauer-Vuksanovic) had been completely determined, but structures with forbidden substructures were untenable using prior techniques.\n\n\nIn 2017, the PI finished a proof showing that the triangle-free Henson graph has finite big Ramsey degrees, and extended this to all k-clique-free Henson graphs by 2018. The proofs developed the bew notion of coding tree and forcing on them to build techniques viable for structures with forbidden substructures. These techniques and proof ideas formed the backdrop for subsequent work of Zucker showing the existence of finite big Ramsey degrees for binary relational free amalgamamation classes in general. In the PI's project from September 2019 through August 2023, the PI has continued developing the area of big Ramsey degrees as well as the more elusive infinite-dimensional Ramsey theory for infinite structures, both in solo papers and with collaborators.\n\n\nThe PI characterized the exact big Ramsey degrees of the triangle-free Henson graph in 2020; around the same time this result was independently obtained by Balko, Chodoundky, Hubicka, Konecny, Vena, and Zucker. The group joined forces to characterize the exact big Ramsey degrees of all binary relational free amalgamation classes. This same group characterized the exact big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order with linear extension, building on prior work of Hubicka. In another vein, with Coulson and Patel, the PI developed an amalgamation property which guarantees that the big Ramsey degrees are as simple as possible and which puts previous work of Devlin, Laflamme, Nguyen Van The, Sauer, and Vuksanovic into a single framework.
