 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). Daniel Brauer is awarded a NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (NSF MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and activities related to broaden participation by groups underrepresented in STEM. This fellowship to Dr. Brauer supports the research project entitled \u201cMPS-Ascend: A Proteomic Approach to Understand and Improve Endosomal Escape\", under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California Berkeley, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Alanna Schepartz.  \r\n\r\nThis proposal intends to use the miniature protein ZF5.3 as a tool to increase the understanding of the cellular machinery involved in endosomal escape and to shed light on endosomal escape structure-activity relationships. The proposed work will develop a novel, time dependent, photocatalyst based proximity labeling strategy to identify the protein and lipid partners of ZF5.3 as it traverses the endocytic pathway to reach the cytosol. The work will also create a high throughput, quantitative assay for endosomal escape to establish structure activity relationships that guide the escape of ZF5.3 with and without protein cargo. Successful implementation of this work may allow for greater understanding of intracellular protein therapeutics. The PI intends to use a data driven framework for improving the academic climate and inclusion of minoritized individuals in the UC Berkeley College of Chemistry. Quantitative survey data will be used to generate targeted solutions to improve inclusion and persistence among UC Berkeley College of Chemistry postdoctoral scholars so that talented and diverse candidates advance to roles as future faculty leaders.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
