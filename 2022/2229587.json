 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) which seeks to harness the power of open-source development for the creation of new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance. Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) is multi-stakeholder, interdisciplinary, open-science collaborative to capitalize on the value of health data using large-scale analytics. OHDSI\u2019s mission is to improve health by empowering a community to collaboratively generate the evidence that promotes better health decisions and care. OHDSI collaborates on many aspects of the journey from data to evidence, including open community data standards, open-source software development, open methodological research, and open network clinical research. The core of OHDSI is about using a standard based common data model to create computable and reproducible analysis on electronic health data.  Electronic health data has privacy protections and restrictions on data sharing.  OHDSI has developed methods to convert local proprietary electronic medical record data into a common format thereby allowing the ecosystem to share code (analysis) between organizations and aggregating only result data. The OHDSI community has grown since its inception in 2014 to include >3000 researchers in >70 countries around the world.  The community has created a research network of 810 million patient records across 300+ sites in a common data format.  There are hundreds of OHDSI-affiliated projects on github using the common data model.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe goal of this project is to mature the open source governance in the OHDSI ecosystem and create an \u201cOHDSI Way\u201d. OHDSI currently hosts over 200 open source repositories on github with 13 million lines of code written by over 400 contributors.  The specific aims of the project are to formalize open source governance activities, develop contributor onramp programs, host developers conferences, and develop metrics and a dashboard to evaluate the health and maturity of the open source projects.  The project will help the OHDSI community make a broader impact into the field of observational research in two ways.  The first is by enabling stable and secure software that can be used to preform analytics inside health systems and industry with a low deployment and maintenance costs.  The second is by enabling greater extensibility of the ODHSI ecosystem to make the software easier to modify and extend for new purposes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Three books and the ideas incorporated were helpful in helping us categorize the different types of groups and projects we have in our community. They were Working in Public by Nadia Eghbal, Governing the Commons by Elinor Ostrom, and Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton. Working in Public provided us with our persona model framework of understanding the incentives and requirements of maintainers, users, funders, and hosting platforms. It also provided a very useful categorization scheme for repositories organized as toys, clubs, stadiums, and federations.\n\n\nConnected through our JHU OSPO network, we worked with the Lyrasis it takes a village open source sustainability framework. We applied the model to conduct a self evaluation to look for our maturity levels in governance, funding, technology, and member engagement. Laurie Arp, one of the authors of the guide came and spoke with our leadership. We also had leaders from open source communities come and speak to our community and benefited greatly from interviews from leaders from the Bioconductor and OpenMRS communities.\n\n\nAt our Open Source Developers Conference in April 24, 2023, we officially launched our OHDSI Technical Advisory Board. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag7k7Xk_qqE&t=886s&ab_channel=OHDSI Minute 26).\n\n\nThe OHDSI TAB was formed of contributor representation to address issues such as the complexity of the software packages and dependencies.

The OHDSI community compiled a group of leading maintainers who gave hands-on session on the architecture of OHDSI, how projects integrated with each other to conduct network studies, how to setup a development environment, and how to work with a group through github. The cohort was exposed to the entire ecosystem across programming languages and platforms to get a global perspective of the mission while also offloading the orientation training off the repository maintainers. The cohort had several successes including a new maintainer for one of our existing repositories. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwMAbgd1YUw&ab_channel=OHDSI). For year two, we incorporated 5 new faculty members and developed 1:1 mentoring based on the interests of the software developer.\n\n\nAs an open science community, OHDSI is committed to transparency in developing evidence. We see the stages our scientific community members go through are 1) onboarding education, 2) engaging in committees and activities, and 3) participating in studies and generating published research. As the open science initiative evolves, there is a need for continuous evaluation of the entire ecosystem for aligning prospective research efforts. We wanted a shared framework of our open science community through a graphical dashboard to enable data driven governance (dash.ohdsi.org)\n\n\nIntegrating with YouTubes public API service we mined over 550 videos uploaded to the official OHDSI YouTube channel since 2016. These videos are from conferences, tutorials, workshops, as well as working group meetings deemed of educational value. Since 2014, those videos have been watched for a cumulative of over 168,000 hours.\n\n\nWith the support of the European Health Data & Evidence Network (EHDEN) Academy, we developed a reporting integration with the open source Moodle based learning management system deployed as OHDSIs free online learning center. To date, over 25 courses have been released on this platform with over 3,400 course completions.\n\n\nThe Bitergia platform was used to harvest daily data through git and github API capturing all the commits, issues, and pull requests conducted. Over the past 10 years over 250 repositories have been created in the OHDSI organization on github encompassing 550 contributors, 13 Million lines of code, 45,000 commits, 9,000 pull requests and 8,000 issues submitted from over a 1,000 submitters. The top 80 repositories have over 20 subscribers.\n\n\nUsing the Pubmed open API we developed an algorithm to identify articles leveraging the OHDSI methods or the OMOP common data model. We have been able to identify and track 590 manuscripts with 3504 unique authors that have been published on Pubmed.\n\n\nWe developed a software system to track the community activities through automated approaches based on open APIs to better understand how individuals the community are onboarded and become engaged in scientific activities. The system is available as an open source project for other open science communities: OHDSI/CommunityDashboard: Dashboard to monitor the health of the OHDSI community (Community Dashboard: https://dash.ohdsi.org).\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/10/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: PaulGNagy\n"
