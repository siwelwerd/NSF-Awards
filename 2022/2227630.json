Knowledge from this project will significantly inform the development of future support for entrepreneurs who experience trauma.\r\n\r\nThe project will assess and track the well-being and coping processes of Ukrainian small business owners displaced by war. Specifically, it will assess personality and social factors associated with resilience as well as the nature of the trauma and loss they experienced. Participants will be tracked over the course of a year and assessed on their current well-being, coping strategies, and future plans.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
