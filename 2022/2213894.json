 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project lies in the development and commercialization of a Tubular Proton Exchange Fuel Cell \u2013 a novel design of a fuel cell technology. Fuel cells operate on hydrogen, a zero-carbon and renewable fuel that offers an opportunity to remove carbon pollution in the power generation and manufacturing sectors.  Fuel cells may mitigate pollution and climate change challenges. The proposed tubular design features a number of components that nay reduce the fuel cell weight by 50% and reduce performance losses, while offering a modular design. Due to modular design, the potential commercial applications range from portable power, micro-mobility, industrial equipment, transportation, and distributed backup power. The development of the proposed novel tubular fuel cell may contribute to the scientific and technological understanding of alternative fuel cell designs and aid in the broadening of hydrogen-based technologies and the transition to the hydrogen economy. This project may also have an impact on the training of future leaders and entrepreneurs and broaden participation in the field of clean energy. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project focuses on prototyping and commercializing tubular proton exchange fuel cells (TPEFCs). State-of-the-art proton exchange fuel cells (PEFCs) currently built in a planar design, use expensive agglomerate-type catalyst layers with poor reactant mass transport and by-product water removal. PEFCs are bulky, complex, and contain expensive flow field/bipolar plates with high pressure drops.  They face challenges due to their cost, degradation and insufficient efficiency. The research objective of this project is to prototype and demonstrate a tubular fuel cell design with improved reactant mass transport and product water removal.  The TPEFCs may eliminate several components of PEFCs (e.g., one flow field plate and a gas diffusion layer), significantly reducing the weigh and cost while also improving the reactant, current, and temperature distribution.  TPEFCs may also increase specific power and energy density. This research seeks to develop and demonstrate a tubular fuel cell prototype, including the electrodes, membrane, inner gas supply/current collector, and outer flow field plate, using advanced fabrication approaches such as additive manufacturing. The project will, in parallel, focus on commercialization of the product through market research, customer discovery, entrepreneurial training of the students, and preparation for a potential start-up company.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
