 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Ball State University (BSU) to support the acquisition of a laser-based biomolecular imaging system to advance biochemical and molecular biology research projects, as well as to improve the quality and expand the scope of research and student training. This new biomolecular imaging system is an essential tool which will allow researchers to detect, visualize, and quantify proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules at the molecular and cellular levels, opening a wide range of possibilities for hands-on experiences for a diverse group of next generation of scientists and teaching students to think critically with problem-based learning modules. The biomolecular imager will cultivate significant societal impact by becoming a shared resource open to investigators from all areas of scientific research not only across the departments at BSU but also from regional universities including Anderson University, Taylor University, Indiana Wesleyan University, as well as high schools such as The Indiana Academy for Science, Mathematics, and Humanities. Using this unique instrumentation, faculty in BSU\u2019s Chemistry and Biology Departments will broaden the dissemination of their research and knowledge by actively participating in several outreach programs. These programs include the Chemistry Research Immersion Summer Program, Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, and a \u201cDNA-Day\u201d activity for high school students to encourage them to consider careers in STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis state-of-the-art instrument supports multiple imaging modes, including red/green/blue and long/short wavelengths of near-infrared fluorescence, optical densitometry of proteins in stained gels, and phosphor imaging. At least seven research groups will use the biomolecular imaging system from BSU\u2019s Chemistry and Biology Departments for individual research, research training programs, and teaching. The new system will advance investigators\u2019 broad and multidisciplinary research objectives, which include (1) the design of various Logic Gated nucleic acid complexes; (2) the development of novel molecular probes derived from a natural glycolipid; (3) understanding of the mechanism of apolipoprotein degradation with relevance to cholesterol related pathologies; (4) uncovering details of the mechanism of modulation of G-quadruplex helicase activity by non-coding RNAs; (5) the development of modern expression systems for novel enzymatic catalysts; (6) elucidation of the roles RNA modification plays in fungi; and (7) searching for a mechanistic explanation for how mitoNEET (mitochondrial membrane protein) serves as a redox sensor across evolution. The critical capabilities of this new instrument, such as exceptional imaging quality, high image resolution, and increased accuracy of quantification, will benefit the faculty's research goals. The outcome of the research projects will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at regional, national, and international scientific meetings within investigators\u2019 respective fields.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
