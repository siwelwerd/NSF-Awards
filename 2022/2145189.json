 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is motivated by a critical need to engineer durable solutions and devices for the cardiovascular health of a global aging population. With existing heart valve replacements vulnerable to premature failure, a recurring challenge is the limited understanding of how the pulsing flow of blood interacts with the heart valve leaflets and affects its long-term durability. By exploiting recent advances in 3D imaging technologies, this project aims to uncover the flow physics relating the influence of a pulsing flow on the fatigue failure of flexible materials. In addition to enabling improved heart valve designs, the research outcomes will benefit a large community of engineers and scientists both in academia and industry who study fluid-structure interaction physics across multiple disciplines such as - natural flight, biomechanics, aeronautics, renewable energy, space exploration, among others. The integrated education plan adopts a three-pronged approach including: (1) implementation of novel game-based learning techniques to improve engagement in university education and research; (2) outreach workshops for K-12 aimed at underrepresented students in STEM; and (3) the adoption of Virtual Reality based education tools aimed at the public.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to develop an integrated research and education program focused on fluid-structure interactions that will reveal scaling laws-based fundamental flow physics for flutter of flexible membranes in a pulsatile flow (e.g., heart valves). To this end, for the first time, this project will establish a new paradigm in higher-fidelity experimental fluid-structure interaction measurements (using light-field imaging) to simultaneously quantify time-resolved 3D flow fields and the associated structural motion or strain. The novel validated experimental method will be used to gather measurements to derive unique scalable parameters to classify regimes of flutter in pulsatile flow and identify the associated flow physics mechanisms. Some of the anticipated research outcomes include: (1) a sound scaling laws-based understanding of fluid-structure interaction of flexible membranes in pulsatile flow; and (2) an extensive database of high-fidelity experimental fluid-structure interaction measurements for computational validation. Such improved quantification of fluid-structure interaction physics and development of scaling laws will enable better prediction of flutter-induced fatigue failure, a key step towards improving longevity of biological heart valve replacements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
