 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program grant supports the acquisition of a state-of-the-art X-Ray Diffraction System (XRD) to advance research and educational activities in physics, chemistry, materials science, and engineering. Located in the southeast of the island, the Cayey campus of the University of Puerto Rico provides access to the XRD system to faculty and students from across the island. The XRD system enables over nine research groups to advance their research projects using diffraction techniques which are only available at this facility. Primary users include faculty from the University of Puerto Rico in the Mayaguez Campus, and the Ana G. Mendez University while researchers from UPR Ponce, R\u00edo Piedras, and Humacao campus also benefit as secondary users.  The project promotes collaboration between different research groups, training for faculty and students, and educational activities.  Training and workshops are offered to undergraduate students participating in research or taking courses that include the use of this instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThe obtained high-resolution X-Ray diffraction system is ideal for the characterization of crystallinity in thin films, nanostructures, and low diffracting materials.  The combination of the parallel beam optics, a channel-cut monochromator, and the goniometer\u2019s triple-axis measurement capacity, allows for high-resolution measurements. The addition of an area detector allows for the study of crystal orientations, not only improving the information obtained for a particular crystal phase, but also providing information on the crystalline texture, defects, and crystalline size amongst others. This instrument enables the study of nanoparticles, multilayers, and thin films with nanometric morphologies. Furthermore, the high-temperature heating attachment and the texture, stress, and Rietveld plugins provide advanced techniques such as reciprocal space mapping, rocking curve, and pole figures measurements.  Projects that benefit from this instrument include studies of multiferroic tunnel junctions, characterization of silver nanoparticles for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, studies of zinc oxide for sensing harmful gases in the parts per billion range, investigations of defects in doped GaN, and the use of the XRD system in integrated undergraduate laboratory experiments including topics from different physics and chemistry sub-disciplines and a variety of instrumental techniques.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the NSF Office of Integrated Activities (OIA), and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
