 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dwarf galaxies are the smallest and least massive of all galaxies. They are nonetheless central to several important issues in astrophysics, including star formation and chemical enrichment, their role as \"building blocks\" of large, and as prime candidates responsible for ionizing the intergalactic hydrogen left over from the Big Bang, ending the universe's so-called \"Dark Ages.\" Dwarfs also have the largest ratio of dark-to-ordinary matter among the galaxy types. Unfortunately, our knowledge of dwarfs is mostly drawn from satellites galaxies that are close to our Milky Way galaxy. This award will support continued investigations of nearby dwarf galaxies as well as an expansion of detailed studies to the hundreds of dwarfs in galaxy groups within a radius of 5 million parsecs (aka the \"Local Volume\").  It will also support three graduate students and a continuing partnership with a minority-serving community college in Tucson, AZ. \r\n\r\nThe researchers plan to investigate dwarf galaxy populations within the Local Volume as well as those halfway across the observable Universe. This will be done using wide-field, high-resolution, multi-object spectrographs in both hemispheres and a new Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectrograph constructed with NSF support - the Integral Field Unit for Magellan (IFUM) - with uniquely configurable spatial and spectral resolution modes to observe dwarf galaxies in these regimes. Primary science goals include 1) mapping Dark Matter halos within Milky Way satellites via multi-epoch spectroscopy that identifies short-period binary stars and efficiently samples outer regions of low member density; 2) analyzing detailed chemical abundance patterns at low metallicities characteristic of Milky Way satellites\u2014including those dominated by stars showing heavy enrichment by r-process elements from rare events like neutron star mergers; 3) combining new spectroscopy with ground and space-based imaging to quantify the abundance, bulk velocities, internal chemo-dynamics and mass-metallicity relation of satellite populations around Milky Way analogs in the Local Volume; 4) obtaining the first measurements of star formation rates, metallicity, and internal kinematics within lensed dwarf galaxies at z ~ 2. The resulting samples will provide the first basis for placing the nearby dwarf galaxy population into a truly cosmological context, enabling the first robust conclusions about dwarf galaxy formation and evolution that are not biased by the circumstances of our position within the Local Group.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
