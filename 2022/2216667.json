 "awd_abstract_narration": "Genetic diversity is important to the survival of endangered species and depends on a species\u2019 ability to disperse across landscapes to share genetic variation between groups. This doctoral dissertation project uses transformative genomic methods to examine the population genetics and dispersal ability of a critically endangered primate, to better understand the influence of human activities on population structure, the status of geographically isolated groups, and potential genetic adaptations to high-elevation environments. While conducting field work, the doctoral student works with international research collaborators who will also aid in initiating conservation educational programming in communities near sampled primate habitats. The doctoral student also records video blogs during lab and field work, to be shared as part of educational programming focused on conservation genetics for high school students. \r\n\r\nThe project examines dispersal ability and overall conservation status of a rare primate using transformative genomics methods. Fecal samples collected from several groups of wild primates are processed in order to sequence the whole mitochondrial genome using portable genomics technologies. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity statistics along with phylogenomic methods are used to differentiate between populations and are combined with GIS-based landscape quantification to assess population connectivity and the impact of human-induced habitat fragmentation. Genome-based assessments of selection on mitochondrial loci related to oxygen use efficiency are used to assess potential physiological limitations to dispersal based on altitude in this species. This project can validate the process of using non-invasively collected fecal samples and local, portable field lab equipment to sequence whole mitochondrial genomes for the purpose of species-wide population genetics. The outcomes of this study may also reveal important factors of landscape, environment and migratory behavior that impact gene flow between populations, which can guide local conservation stakeholders regarding protected area formation, corridor formation or maintenance for migration and gene flow, and where community-based conservation programs may be most needed.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
