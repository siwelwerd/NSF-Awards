 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will add an agile locally and globally sharable HPCC (High-Performance Computing Cluster) hosted in a ScienceDMZ enclave, integrated with national science computing facilities, including the Open Science Grid (OSG), by creatively using recent advances in federated science networking and distributed systems\u2019 virtualization open to regional faculty. The system is composed of 18 nodes with dual Intel Xeon Gold 6242R class CPUs (20 core), 192GB RAM, and an NVIDIA A30 class GPUs. Storage is spread across the nodes using CEPH\r\n\r\nThe project supports several interesting newly emerging collaborative HPCC workflows- scienceware as-a-service (SAS) and science-data-lakes (SDL), and intense real-time-computing (iRTC) besides supporting the HPC and HTC workflows. NSF-funded resources in this project are open to all faculty researchers in northeast Ohio colleges and their collaborators, including the faculty of all eight campuses of Kent who are in the network\u2019s latency proximity and engaged in data-intensive collaborative workflows. In order to support high throughput and collaborative computing, the ScienceDMZ exercises a new model of unimpeded host-centric cauterized and federated security, as opposed to the traditional perimeter focused security approach. It is already fronted by a 100-Gbps Data Transfer Node (DTN) capable of \u2018friction-free\u2019 long-haul transferring massive datasets. \r\n\r\nThe project directly contributes to NSF\u2019s goals to foster innovation, integration, and engineering of new campus-level networking and cyberinfrastructure that can assertively support widely collaborative, multi-campus distributed massive-data driven research and harness largely untapped potential to share unused compute cycles and resources across the entire academic fabric, while leveraging a compelling set of science projects from a wide variety of disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
