 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the potential development of a new generation of coated metallic parts for various industries such as automotive, aerospace, oil and gas, and biomaterials. The innovation may improve the automotive and aerospace industries by replacing their heavy, cast-iron parts with lighter aluminum ones. Additionally, the metallic parts may result in improved conventional brake discs and cylinders by potentially reducing the expenses, energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions of the resultant lighter-weight vehicles. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of an emerging surface technology process to coat ceramics and composites on metallic parts. Improved mechanical properties (hardness, adhesion strength) and tribological behaviors (friction and wear resistance) are some of the desirable properties that can potentially be achieved using the proposed coating method. The team also seeks to overcome environmental issues that result from the current use of acids and toxic metals such as nickel. The surface coating process provides a high growth rate (7-10 \u03bcm/min) that may reduce current coating times and energy consumption.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
