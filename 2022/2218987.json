The American Control Conference is internationally recognized as a premier scientific and engineering conference, dedicated to the advancement of control theory and practice.\r\n\r\nThe technical program for the conference will comprise presentations in regular and invited sessions, tutorial sessions, poster sessions, and special sessions along with workshops and exhibits. Attendees will have opportunities to discuss the latest trends and newest scientific findings in the field, attend educational and training-based sessions, and develop and expand their scientific and professional networks. Applications of automatic control considered in this conference include cutting-edge challenges in energy systems and smart grids, manufacturing networks, finance and risk management, autonomous vehicles, systems biology, and security and resilience of cyber-physical systems, all areas of research relevant to the mission of the National Science Foundation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This award helped facilitate attendance of the 2022 ACC for students who are traditionally underrepresented at such conferences through registration grants and partial travel support. The 2022 ACC took place from June 8-10, 2022 at the Atlanta Marriott Marquis and brought together an international community of 1211 researchers and practitioners (including 404 students). This travel/registration award supported 56 students from groups that are traditionally under-represented as such venues, thus enabling a more diverse set of attendees. Grant recipients were exposed to the latest advances and future directions over the broad range of control theory and applications. Educational and training opportunities included 9 pre-conference workshops, 6 tutorial sessions, as well as on-site demonstrations. There were also a number of networking opportunities and educational sessions that were of particular interest to grant recipients including the Women in Control lunch, and a one hour Student Networking Event designed to introduce students to professionals in industry, academia, and national labs. The broad range of topics and the international community of researchers that it attracts (typically 40% are non-US attendees) makes ACC a venue for students and researchers (at all stages of their careers) to engage in meaningful interactions with other attendees. This in person interaction and networking events was particularly important for the student researchers as the ACC 2022 was the first in person ACC since 2019. Attending such conferences provides students a broader exposure to the field and facilitates formal and informal networking opportunities that can help students expand their professional network, and build greater connections with mentors and peers within the controls community. Stronger connections to the community can ultimately increase the likelihood for these students choose to pursue related careers and therefore broaden participation of under-represented groups in these STEM disciplines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/26/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dennice&nbsp;F&nbsp;Gayme</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
