 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans are modifying the diversity of life on Earth, changing the number and composition of species in ecosystems. It is essential to understand how these changes will affect how natural systems function. This project evaluates a promising method for predicting the impacts of biodiversity change by linking species\u2019 physical characteristics \u2013 their shapes and forms \u2013 to the key roles that they play in communities and ecosystems. These links between traits and emergent roles are poorly described, especially in coastal marine environments. This project involves screening the traits of seaweed species along gradients in environmental conditions on rocky shorelines \u2013 tide height, exposure to heavy surf, and latitude \u2013 along the U.S. West Coast and (via a partnership with the Natural Environment Research Council in the United Kingdom) the coast of Europe. This project includes experiments and outreach in regions with substantial exposure to the public, and the investigators will work with community, university, and museum outreach personnel to communicate this research to broader audiences. The project includes mechanisms for curriculum development and outreach and trains undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in marine science. The project also supports a visual arts exhibit for public display that illustrates the loss of seaweed species. \r\n\r\nThe investigators are using a suite of innovative approaches to understand the links between functional traits and emergent functional attributes of seaweeds, providing an unprecedented dataset linking seaweed morphology, physiology, and ecology: (i) characterizing the functional structure of seaweed communities and how that structure changes across environmental gradients, (ii) evaluating how that suite of easily measured traits is related to physiological and ecological processes, (iii) measuring species and traits at multiple sites along U.S. and European coastlines spanning gradients in latitude, wave exposure, and tidal elevation, and (iv) evaluating changes in functional redundancy along these gradients to quantify vulnerability of community interactions and ecosystem functioning to species loss These methods and approaches facilitate exploration of relationships between algal form and function and provide insights into the functional consequences of changes in seaweed diversity, with the potential to transform understanding of marine biodiversity across levels of biological organization. These advances in linking seaweeds\u2019 functional traits, functional groups, and roles in community- and ecosystem-level processes enhance prediction of the impacts of changing biodiversity \u2013 especially along environmental gradients and species ranges \u2013 and serve as a template for a mechanistic understanding of the roles of species in communities and ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis is a project jointly funded by the National Science Foundation\u2019s Directorate for Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement. This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
