The Compound Semiconductor Week brings together the international community of researchers.  It is one of the first international conferences to prioritize the in-person experience of the participants while providing a hybrid option during the pandemic. Promotion of research in compound semiconductors, an important genre of semiconductors, is poised to make a significant impact on basic collaborative research and workforce development in the field of semiconductors. The CSW 2022 is expected to host 250 participants with about half of them being students.  The technical program with 12 subtopics is designed to achieve a purposeful balance and inclusiveness considering researcher\u2019s gender, origin, ethnicity, seniority and research topics. In addition, to debuting new independent principal investigators to the research community, the CSW 2022 curated a program for the New Faces in Compound Semiconductors, providing a critical experience for the research community to transition through the pandemic period.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
