 "awd_abstract_narration": "The last twenty years have seen an unprecedented growth of AI-enabled technologies in practically every industry. More recently, an emphasis has been placed on ensuring industry and government agencies that use or produce AI-enabled technology have a social responsibility to protect consumers and increase trustworthiness in products and services. As a result, regulatory groups are producing standards for artificial intelligence (AI) ethics worldwide. The Center for Standards and Ethics in Artificial Intelligence (CSEAI) aims to provide industry and government the necessary resources for adopting and efficiently implementing standards and ethical practices in AI through research, outreach, and education.  \r\n\r\nCSEAI\u2019s mission is to work closely with industry and government research partners to study AI protocols, procedures, and technologies that enable the design, implementation, and adoption of safe, effective, and ethical AI standards. The varied AI skillsets of CSEAI faculty enable the center to address various fundamental research challenges associated with the responsible, equitable, traceable, reliable, and governable development of AI-fueled technologies.  For example, the center site at Rutgers University will examine intelligible model explanations for deeply sensed environments and cyber-physical systems, privacy-aware learning for sensing applications, and federated learning for nonconvex problems.\r\n\r\nThe CSEAI will help industry and government organizations that use or produce AI technology to provide standardized, ethical products safe for consumers and users, helping the public regain trust and confidence in AI technology. The center will recruit, train, and mentor undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs from diverse backgrounds, motivating them to pursue careers in AI ethics and producing a diverse workforce trained in standardized and ethical AI. The center will release specific ethics assessment tools, and AI best practices will be licensed or made available to various stakeholders through publications, conference presentations, and the CSEAI summer school.\r\n\r\nBoth a publicly accessible repository and a secured members-only repository (comprising meeting materials, workshop information, research topics and details, publications, etc.) will be maintained either on-site at Baylor University and/or on a government/DoD-approved cloud service. A single public and secured repository will be used for CSEAI, where permissible, to facilitate continuity of efforts and information between the different sites. This repository will be accessible at a publicly listed URL at Baylor University, https://cseai.center, for the lifetime of the center and moved to an archiving service once no longer maintained.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
