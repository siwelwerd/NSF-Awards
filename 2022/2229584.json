 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 60th Anniversary Workshop at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory will be held in Lima, Peru, in July of 2022. The workshop will commemorate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Jicamarca Radio Observatory, the premier geospace facility dedicated to research in equatorial aeronomy, space physics, and space weather. Jicamarca began reporting scientific findings approximately 60 years ago. The purpose of the workshop is to commemorate this, to highlight the most important research taking place in equatorial aeronomy and space physics presently, and to highlight how recent and planned upgrades to Jicamarca can contribute to and expedite this research. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will bring together some of the most active researchers in equatorial aeronomy and space physics (and their students). Some particularly auspicious topics to be covered include fundamental incoherent scatter theory, plasma instabilities in the valley region and topside, space-weather forecasting, neutral wind measurements, and experimental methods based on distributed instruments. The workshop will also familiarize the aeronomy community with recent breakthroughs in the field, disseminate information about recent and planned upgrades to the Jicamarca facility, promote the education and training of students and early-career professionals, including Jicamarca stakeholders, and broaden participation in geospace sciences by convening a workshop in Latin America.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
