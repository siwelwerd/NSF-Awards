 "awd_abstract_narration": "Error-correcting codes are a fundamental tool for protecting data in communication and storage.  Graph-based codes \u2013 codes constructed and analyzed using tools from combinatorics and graph theory \u2013 are an important class of error-correcting codes.  This project will develop new algorithms and techniques for graph-based codes.  Such algorithms will have applications not only in communication and storage, but also in areas like algorithm design and complexity theory.  This project also involves educational and outreach components, such as the development of publicly available teaching materials, including a series of YouTube lectures; and research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, with an emphasis on recruiting from groups underrepresented in computing. This project is an international collaboration, made possible through joint funding with the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF).\r\n\r\nIn more detail, this project will develop techniques for list- and local-decoding of graph-based codes.  In the standard unique decoding problem, a receiver wants to reconstruct a sender\u2019s message exactly; in list-decoding, the receiver is allowed to produce a short list of possible messages; in local-decoding, the receiver is only responsible for a small portion of the original message.  While graph-based codes are extremely well-studied for unique decoding, especially in the setting of stochastic errors, they are much less common for list-decoding or local-decoding.  This project will make progress on two major open problems in coding theory, beyond graph-based codes: to achieve linear-time capacity-achieving list-decoding algorithms, and to perform local decoding with high rate and low query complexity.  Moreover, progress in these areas will feed back into unique decoding, leading to uniquely decodable codes with extremely efficient decoding algorithms.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nError correcting codes are a fundamental tool to protect data from noise. Since their introduction in the 1940's and 1950's, error correcting codes have found applications throughout computer science and engineering. One class of error correcting codes, useful in applications from communication to complexity theory, are graph-based codes. Such codes -- which include expander codes, LDPC codes, and other families -- are notable for their fast decoding algorithms.The focus of this project was to leverage graph-based codes to develop extremely fast algorithms for emerging problems in a variety of application areas.\r\n\n\nThe major outcomes include advances in a few areas:\r\n\n\nSublinear-time and communication-efficient algorithms: Work supported by this award showed how to use error correcting codes efficiently in a distributed setting, by computing particular functions of the data with low communication. This has downstream applications in distributed storage, distribution computation, and cryptography.\r\n\n\nAlgorithmic applications of graph-based codes: Work supported by this award develops new constructions of graph-based codes, and algorithms for them, that can be used to speed up streaming algorithms.\r\n\n\nApplications in quantum computation: Work supported by this award developed new algorithms for decoding quantum graph-based codes, as well as showing how to use classical decoding algorithms (of graph-based codes and other codes) to build quantum optimization algorithms.\r\n\n\nThis was an international collaboration, made possible through joint funding with the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF). The project brought together one US investigator and one Israeli investigator.\r\n\n\nIntellectual Merit.The results discussed above are of interest to the coding theory communities in Theoretical Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Physics, and the results of this work have been presented at conferences and workshops in all four disciplines.\n\r\n\n\nBroader Impacts.This project has technological impact beyond coding theory, due to the many applications of fast algorithms for error correcting codes. This project has educational impact through the development of publicly available course materials on coding theory; by funding Ph.D. students and post-doctoral researchers; and by supporting undergraduate research.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/11/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MaryKWootters\n"
