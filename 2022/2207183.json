This program will be state-wide, with integration of individual\r\nresearchers, institutions and organizations. It will both build research capacity, in order to implement a\r\nsustained increase in research competitiveness, and build human infrastructure in the form of\r\nbroadening participation and workforce development. During implementation of the planning grant, the team\r\nwill assess the existing research and human infrastructure, coordinate and plan state-wide efforts, host\r\nan all-hands meeting, and develop a collaboration plan.\r\n\r\nThe planning grant from Iowa State University presents a  plan for the development of a Chemurgy 2.0 proposal \r\nfor submission to the FY23 RII Track-1 competition.  Planning activities have been ongoing for several months \r\nnow, and the funding requested will allow a consultant to orchestrate the discussions within Iowa needed \r\nto formulate a strong full proposal.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
