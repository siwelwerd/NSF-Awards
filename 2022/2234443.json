 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 22nd ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM will be held in Niche, France October 25 - October 27, 2022. This grant will help 10 - 12 US-based graduate students participate in the conference to disseminate their research outcomes, connect them with other researchers, and train them as the next generation of scholars. The Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is the premier international conference in the area of Internet measurement. Attending the conference will help them pursue research in the field.\r\n\r\nThrough this travel grant, the IMC 2022 will bring together the expertise, scholars, and students who might not otherwise be able to attend. The conference will facilitate three days of interactions and mutual learning and active discussion, which help the students learn from them. Upon completion of the conference, the students will be required to submit a report describing (1) the session that they find most valuable and (2) the efforts and outcomes that they made for the new relationships and contacts made through networking.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will increase the dissemination of the conference's research results to a larger and more diverse audience. Moreover, IMC has a strong track record of giving preference in grant awards to women and minority students. To encourage researchers from under-represented groups to get involved with Internet measurement research, in the selection process, under-represented groups or institutions will be considered the most important factor. Advertising to a wide range of colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of institutions should also be able to attend and benefit from the conference.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
