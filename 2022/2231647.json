 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Oceanography Society (TOS) will publish a special issue of the open-access journal Oceanography on \u201cBuilding Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Ocean Sciences\u201d that highlights the successes and lessons learned from agency-supported programs and initiatives focused on increasing the number of scholars from underrepresented and marginalized groups who choose the ocean sciences for their careers. The special issue will explore the structural and cultural barriers that underrepresented and marginalized scholars come up against and offer successful strategies for enacting meaningful changes to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion. An online-only supplement will contain autobiographical sketches of ocean scientists from diverse backgrounds, similar to the highly successful \u201cWomen in Oceanography\u201d profiles published in Oceanography in 2005 and 2014 that have inspired a generation of women oceanographers. The proposed special issue has three main goals: (1) to serve as a resource for building diversity, equity, and inclusion in the ocean sciences; (2) to inspire people and institutions to earnestly review practices and commit to meaningful positive changes to achieve a truly equitable, inclusive, and diverse ocean sciences field; and (3) to encourage scholars from underrepresented and marginalized groups to become and remain ocean scientists. The collection of articles, sidebars, and profiles will provide a useful \u201chandbook\u201d for institutions prepared to take the necessary steps to increase\u2014and retain\u2014diversity in their ranks, ensuring a vibrant, equitable, and inclusive future for the ocean sciences.\r\n\r\nThe ocean sciences, and geosciences in general, lack diversity at all levels. Articles scattered throughout the published literature document the minimal progress toward increasing diversity in the geosciences over the last 40 years. The Oceanography Society seeks to publish a compendium that includes invited manuscripts written by individuals and groups that showcase authentic voices and perspectives of diverse scientists, students, program managers, cultural practitioners, and educators who are engaged in initiatives and programs with diverse communities in a variety of areas of ocean science. An important discussion will be the specific barriers to entry, participation, success, and retention in the field. Successful strategies to engage, recruit, retain, support, and advance individuals and groups from diverse backgrounds will be highlighted with the goal of assembling a critical resource for changing the dominant academic and workforce culture. Individuals with authentic voices will be invited to share their stories through a series of one-page autobiographical sketches that amplify the importance of diversity for excellence, innovation, problem solving, creativity, business acumen, and different ways of knowing and sharing knowledge. This special issue of Oceanography will provide a coherent compendium that can be used as a reference for building a diverse ocean sciences community and inspiration for the next generation of underrepresented and marginalized scholars to become\u2014and remain\u2014ocean scientists. To ensure the greatest impact within the ocean sciences and beyond, a freely available PDF of the full issue will be made available for download from the Oceanography website along with individual articles and autobiographical sketches.  TOS will promote these materials through social media, authors\u2019 networks at the time of publication, and at conferences, and will make an effort to notify the deans and chairs of marine and ocean science programs of the availability of this document.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
