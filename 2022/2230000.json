 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to bring together senior and early career researchers, including graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, in the 7th series of the \u201cKUMUNU-ISU Conference on PDEs, Dynamical systems, and Applications\". KUMUNU-ISU has historically been organized as an annual regional weekend Meeting alternating between the University of Kansas, the University of Missouri-Columbia, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Iowa State University. The 7th KUMUNU-ISU Conference will be held at Iowa State University (ISU) April 22-23, 2023. The goals of this conference are: (i) to provide an opportunity for a diverse group of well-regarded researchers to disseminate their recent results in applied mathematics and partial differential equations (PDE); (ii) to facilitate the interaction and exchange of ideas among all conference participants. This project intends to positively impact the educational and research programs of the participating graduate students, postdocs and early career faculty. In particular, the organizers will make a great effort to encourage the participation of researchers who are female and/or from underrepresented groups in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis Conference will provide a scientifically profitable platform for showcasing recent developments in: (i) the mathematical and numerical analysis of the PDE\u2019s which govern fluid and fluid-structure interactions; (ii) the qualitative properties of general infinite dimensional dynamical systems; (iii) the analysis of coupled parabolic/hyperbolic evolution equations. This project intends that the KUMUNU-ISU Meeting will facilitate mutually beneficial interaction and possibly forge new research collaborations amongst the participants \u2013 senior and junior researchers alike \u2013 who might generally not have large opportunity to share their views outside their respective research circles. The Conference website is https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/peling/7th-kumunu-isu-conference-pde-dynamical-systems-and-applications.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
