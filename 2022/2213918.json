 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to develop a battery health monitoring technology and a prototype system that can detect performance deterioration and possible battery failures more quickly and accurately than current technologies. Fast and accurate health monitoring of batteries impacts a wide range of applications and products and may have significant impact on the safety of materials and personnel. Applications and products such as electric and hybrid-electric vehicles, electric aircrafts, electric boats, green homes and buildings, off-power-grid homes and buildings, backup battery systems for data centers and computing infrastructure, communication systems, hospitals and grid or micro-grid scale energy storage are potential direct beneficiaries of this technology. The resiliency of power availability increasingly impacts daily lives and security. Fast and accurate state-of-health degradation evaluation technology is also important for repurposing batteries for second-life use.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project seeks to develop a battery health monitoring technology. The technology employs new battery health indicators, advanced algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks, and measurement methods that are suitable for online applications and simultaneous multi-battery component monitoring with reduced cost and size. A proof-of-concept prototype will be developed during this project to demonstrate the competitive advantages of the technology such as accuracy, speed, cost, and size.  The project seeks to evaluate and demonstrate the commercial potential and viability of the technology using many parameters.  The proof-of-concept prototype will also be used to demonstrate the technology to potential industry collaborators and partners.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
