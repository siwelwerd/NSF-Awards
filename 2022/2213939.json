 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project, if successful, is to address the shortage of skilled workforce in specialized areas of the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, such as production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). The proposed technology consists of a user-friendly Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) training framework for API manufacturing processes. Current training methods, including in-class and computer-based learning, do not adequately address the critical skills that manufacturing operators need, resulting in difficulties in operating and maintaining key process equipment. Consequently, schedule disruptions and batch failures occur and cause significant losses of time and money. The proposed VR/AR-based training is expected to remedy the inadequacies of pharmaceutical training processes that cause continued operator errors and delay drug availability as witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed virtual simulation offers coordinated visual spatial perception feedback cues to develop motor skills for procedural knowledge and memory. The interactive training actively engages trainees to explore the connections between actions and outcomes, build schemas, and develop detailed, accurate mental models of API manufacturing operations.  Optimal training may provide affordable, precise, and quality drug delivery for generic and personalized medicines to needy patients.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop an interactive, photorealistic VR/AR framework for training technicians in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) operations.  Current virtual modules are not scalable across multiple devices and are not built with the end user customization in mind. This project advances multimodal (augmented reality, mixed reality, and desktop VR) support, accommodating access via head mounted displays, hand-held tablet devices, and/or desktop computers to accommodate diverse learning styles. The project goals are to: 1) identify VR/AR-specific visual, auditory, and haptic cues to enhance transfer of training and retention in API operations, 2) judicious use of these features to design and implement virtual training for multimodal access. The photorealistic modules will include highly-detailed API operations, component assembly/dismantling procedures, and alternative scenario visualization/simulation through interactive parameter modification. Customizable interface functionalities allow users to enable or disable guidance/query features, captions, and audio. Following proper VR training, participant performance will be observed to incorporate iterative enhancements. The intellectual merit involves the novel design of customizable VR/AR interfaces reducing cognitive load and optimizing integration of visual, auditory, and haptic stimuli for training-transfer and retention. The metrics for success will focus on accuracy, schedule optimization, and safety in order to demonstrate the efficiency of VR in pharmaceutical training.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
