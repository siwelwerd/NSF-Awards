 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed project is an ultrasensitive, high performance, chip-scale optical gyroscope, which takes advantage of material nonlinearities and photosensitivity to enhance performance. Measuring rotation of spinning objects is an important scientific objective. Additionally, it has a broad range of applications in consumer electronics, aircraft, inertial navigation, and astronomy, spanning multiple length scales from the macroscale (automotive, oil drilling, air travel, space exploration, submarine navigation) to the nanoscale (lab-on-a-chip and biological applications). The popular micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) gyroscopes, which exploits Coriolis force for rotation sensing, are small, light, and well-suited for consumer electronics, automotive needs, and medical instruments. However, for more demanding automotive, robotics, aerospace and defense applications, MEMS solutions are not suitable as they contain moving parts. Optical gyroscopes such as the ring laser gyroscope and the fiber optical gyroscope offer an alternative but suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio, limiting their applicability, especially in environments where global positioning systems (GPS) are ineffective. Additionally, these conventional optical gyroscopes do not lend themselves to miniaturization. In this proposal, we offer a novel solution . The potential impact on electrical, mechanical and aerospace engineering, as well as astronomy and physics, will be enormous. The technical goals naturally integrate with the education and outreach plans. Interdisciplinary research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students as well as researchers will blend research with education both in the laboratory and the classroom. The online Master\u2019s degree in Electrical Engineering that University of Colorado Boulder is launching featured courses on both semiconductors, lasers, and detectors taught by both of the PIs. Outreach activities include a summer camp on electromagnetism for under-represented students, demonstration for several Engineering Days for under-represented students, advising of the Women in Electrical Engineering student group and a newly awarded Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) program that is tied to several women\u2019s groups include the Women in Science and Engineering and the Society for Women in Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. \r\n\r\nThe innovative concept proposed in this project will enable a new level of performance on a chip-scale platform that will be critical for navigation in GPS-denied environments. It is particularly suited for space, drone, and other aerospace applications, where size, weight and power are critical factors. The conventional optical gyroscopes such as ring laser gyroscope and the fiber optical gyroscope rely on the Sagnac effect, in which a phase shift between optical beams, travelling in opposite directions, is induced under angular rotation. While these devices are effective, they are limited by the weakness of Sagnac effect and noise from nonlinearities, thermal fluctuations, and backscattering. This constrains the ability to perform at the necessary level for inertial navigation systems, especially in environments where global positioning systems (GPS) are ineffective. Additionally, the Sagnac effect is directly proportional to path area, creating significant hurdles for miniature devices. We propose a novel solution based on the Sagnac effect. The combination of a photosensitive, nonlinear chalcogenide material and a chip-scale platform is a game changer.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
