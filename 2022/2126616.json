 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve standards for safety-critical connectivity of drones flying Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS). The drone communication market requires superior link reliability to BVLOS drone applications at an affordable price. The proposed technologies seek to control BVLOS operations enabling improved safety and increased trust in autonomous airspace systems from both regulatory authorities and society. Network-based solutions to improve airborne links require costly enhancements to the network and a large number of drone devices to be profitable. The team is focused on solving aerial command and control problems using the current mobile network; The technology seeks full integration with the 5G network and compatibility with subsequent network generations.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop and de-risk the connection reliability enhancement algorithms for Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) drones, enhancing connection reliability. The technological improvements allow use of any network generation (2G/3G/4G/5G), delivering connection reliability to 95% of the global population. The team has three enabling innovations: 1) voice channel communication redundancy which translates commands into audio signals transmitted over the voice channel, 2) an algorithm for handover (HO) optimization which minimizes ping-pong HO, radio link failures (RLF) and connection losses, and 3) safe route planning which allows drone operators to select the best route for reliable connectivity given the network circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
