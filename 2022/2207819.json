 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Standard Model of particle physics has been successful at passing all laboratory tests.  Despite this fact, it is also known to be incomplete.  For instance, it cannot explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe\u2014a fact which is essential for our very existence. A promising and cost-effective avenue for discovering hints of a better underlying theory is to perform table-top precision measurements on trapped atoms and molecules, searching for tiny deviations from the Standard Model predictions. In this work, the researchers will develop techniques for precision measurements on atoms and molecules trapped within inert cryogenic crystals. This work could also have great significance for the development of quantum sensors and quantum simulators. Students and postdocs doing this work will develop skillsets in laboratory research, scientific communication, and general project planning and implementation.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will produce the first doped cryocrystals suitable for searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. Trapping molecules in an inert crystal allows for both extremely high densities and sufficient isolation to potentially surpass the reach of traditional precision techniques by orders of magnitude. This huge potential advantage can only be realized if the dopants retain their critical quantum properties. Key features have been demonstrated, but with performance limited by the polycrystalline structure of the host matrices\u2014because different local configurations lead to different dopant quantum properties. Since undoped inert single crystals have previously been grown up to centimeter-sized volumes, large doped single crystals should also be achievable. The researchers will demonstrate the first growth of large inert single crystals by vapor-deposition, a technique consistent with introducing dopants.  They will characterize these large doped single crystals using X-rays. Finally, the researchers will make the first demonstration of good quantum properties of high-density dopants filling large volumes.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
