 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the technologies we use in our everyday lives employ measurement and feedback to operate robustly.  For example, sensors on airplanes feed back to the ailerons, elevators and rudder to pilot automatically on a pre-set course.  Less tangibly, electronic circuits in computers and cell phones use feedback to compute reliably despite imperfections in fabrication.  Similarly, future technologies based on quantum physics can be expected to rely on measurement-based feedback.  Applications of such technologies include quantum computation, which will require quantum error correction to be performed robustly, and also quantum sensing and communication.  Inspired by such applications, physicists are interested generally in so-called open quantum mechanical systems in which a small fraction of the system is occasionally measured while the remainder of the system retains quantum coherence and entanglement.  There are theoretical predictions of new types of phenomena that emerge in these systems, but few experimental platforms exist in which to test these predictions.\r\n \r\nThe goal of the proposed program is to enable measurements of a portion of a complex quantum system while the remainder of the system continues to evolve coherently.  This capability will be realized specifically within arrays of optically trapped single atoms.  The evolution of the internal states of these atoms will be controlled by optical pulses either that modify the states of single atoms, or that couple and entangle the states of atoms in separate optical traps.  Measurements amidst this programmed quantum evolution will be performed optically, using optical resonators to achieve high-fidelity measurement at short measurement times and without disturbing other atoms in the array.  The measurement outcome can then be used to modify the optical control pulses, effecting feedback on a complex quantum system.  Both laser-optical and experimental-control systems will be developed to enable such operation.  This instrument will then operate as a shared user facility within the Challenge Institute for Quantum Computation, an NSF Quantum Leap Challenge Institute, and will allow experimental investigations of quantum teleportation, quantum error correction, cluster-state generation, interactive quantum dynamics, and quantum-state preparation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We focused specifically on a platform in which single neutral atoms are trapped, using focused laser beams, inside of a vacuum chamber. Each of these single atoms can store a bit of quantum information. The novelty of our instrument is that this array of single neutral atoms is placed within an optical resonator, in which these atoms interact strongly with a well controlled beam of light, and also that these atoms can be made to interact with one another by exciting them between particular high-energy excited states (Rydberg states).
