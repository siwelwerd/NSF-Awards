 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's Indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions increases the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, supports research studies in areas that may be locally relevant and encourages faculty members to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This two-year research project submitted by Ilisagvik College aligns directly with these goals. Building on a previous study to comprehensively assess bacterial species by type and abundance present in the soil of the arctic tundra, the study engages undergraduate and secondary school students in faculty-led research in which soil samples will be collected, genetically sequenced, and quantified, to identify and inventory pathogenic species of bacteria. Data generated will contribute to crucial information for tracking the ramifications of changes in climate as potentially pathogenic bacteria are released due to tundra thawing. Along with the broader impacts the study supports related to public health, additional impacts are realized through involving students in real-world research relevant to their communities and stimulating student interest in STEM degrees and careers.\r\n\r\nContinuing research that has been ongoing for 5+ years and involving Ilisagvik College faculty and student researchers, this project will engage in a comprehensive assessment of microbial species, measuring the composition and abundance of bacterial species that are present in three layers of arctic tundra soil in Utqia\u0121vik, Alaska through dependent and independent culturing, DNA extraction, DNA sequencing, and analysis. The study focuses on looking for pathogenic species relevant to public health including Mycobacterium simulans. Using an ice-core drill, soil samples will be collected in January, February, March, April, September, and October 2022 \u2013 2024 from the Barrow Environmental Observatory located in Utqia\u0121vik, AK. Researchers will engage in gene sequencing and measuring the abundance of actively transcribing bacterial species that are present in the samples. This work holds significant intellectual value to advance arctic climate research in its contribution to the body of data required to track and analyze the potential ramifications of pathogens released due to tundra thaw. Additionally, by mentoring students in conducting place-based research that affects them directly, the project encourages students to pursue STEM educational pathways and careers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
