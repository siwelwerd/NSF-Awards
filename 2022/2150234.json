 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole (or in part) under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). The award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in physics at Indiana University (IU). The program will support up to fifteen participants for 10 weeks during the summers of 2022-24 to carry out experimental and theoretical research projects in a broad range of areas in the IU Physics Department and the IU Center for Exploration of Energy and Matter (CEEM). Twelve (12) students from schools throughout the U.S. will be recruited, with preference to students from institutions where research opportunities for undergraduates may be limited. Two or three (2-3) local IU students will also be invited to participate in the program. Special programs for the students include orientation sessions on lab safety, weekly seminars on current research in physics, discussions on professional development and scientific ethics, and short progress reports. At the conclusion of the program, the students will present their results in talks at a closing symposium and develop a way to share their results to a technical audience. They will also be encouraged and supported to continue working on their projects as well as to present their work at professional meetings during the following academic year. \r\n\r\nThe program provides interested and promising undergraduate physics majors with significant and challenging experiences in scientific research in a research-intensive environment. Students will be matched to projects appropriate to their level and interests, and early contact of students and mentors will be encouraged. The participants will gain original research experience by working as integral parts of ongoing research programs under the supervision of faculty members and senior research staff. Students will learn about a broad range of current research areas through seminars and peer interactions. Research projects will be available in a variety of areas, including experimental and theoretical research in astrophysics, biophysics, condensed matter physics, elementary particle physics, materials physics, and nuclear physics. The program emphasizes the development of clear, honest, and concise scientific communication and presentation skills.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
