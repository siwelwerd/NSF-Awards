 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).\r\n\r\nDNA methylation is a critical biological process that plays such an important role in gene regulation that it has often been referred to as the \u201cfifth base of DNA.\u201d In addition to playing an important role during development and throughout aging, aberrations in DNA methylation have been discovered to cause disease, including cancer and neurological disorders. Yet much is still unknown regarding where DNA methylation changes occur and which genes they impact. This, coupled with its dynamic nature, which can vary across regions of the body, throughout the life cycle, and in response to the environment, makes accurately identifying the association of specific methylation patterns to biological phenomena of interest and interpreting their downstream impacts challenging. The project will result in a suite of new tools to enable analysis of methylation sites across experimental technologies, analyze methylation data in the context of different tissues and cell types, and predict the downstream impacts of methylation sites that are changing across conditions. These tools will enable researchers to better interpret their methylation data in light of existing knowledge, which can in turn result in improved understanding of fundamental biological processes (e.g., development, aging). In addition to making all methods available as open-source software, databases of predictions and interactive visualizations will be developed and accessible online. By doing so, biological researchers with no programming experience can use a query-based system to easily make and explore predictions in the context of their own data. This project also has a local outreach component to help increase the diversity and persistence of underrepresented minorities in STEM by engaging high school biology teachers and community college students with newly designed data driven curricula as well as research opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe research will adapt cutting edge deep learning methods used for imputation in other domains to increase the coverage of DNA methylation platforms that profile <10% of all sites, saving time and resources; use a hierarchical framework that mirrors natural tissue and cell type dependencies to find location-specific methylation hallmarks; and incorporate known protein-protein interactions to associate CpG sites with biological function, beyond existing methods which primarily capture proximal regulatory relationships. In addition to the methodological contributions of this work, the project is inherently interdisciplinary and will lay the groundwork for understanding fundamental biological questions such as how methylation regulates and maintains tissue specificity. The tools and results from this project can be found at: https://cs.rice.edu/~vy/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
