 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study seeks to better understand citizen data practices, namely, which data are related to serious social problems are more important to citizens and what citizens actually do with open data. It focuses on citizen data about gender-based violence, and specifically data about the killing of women and girls for reasons based on their gender. While there has been a great deal of research on open data, and speculation about its benefits to democracy, there has been comparatively less empirical work. It is well-established that official data on gender violence and feminicide are often incomplete, difficult to access, infrequently updated, and underreported. Citizen groups have stepped into these gendered data gaps.  This research project aims to empirically study the informatic practices of groups that undertake citizen data science about feminicide as well as develop design implications for how human-centered computing may better support this work. By systematizing ad-hoc citizen practices into an empirical model and cultivating citizens' own human-centered computing design ideas, this work will advance the practice of citizen data science on the topic of feminicide as well as support public awareness, policy and civil society-public sector collaboration on civic data about gender-based violence.\r\n\r\nThis research will make four contributions to the scholarly literature in the fields of human-computer interaction, critical data studies, women's and gender studies, and sociology. (1) Empirical contribution: The project aims first of all to advance empirical understanding of citizen data science practices about feminicide and gender-based killing which have been the subject of little research. This will provide the empirical groundwork for digital tools and research that can better support citizen data science about gender-based violence, and could potentially lead to increased government-civil society cooperation around feminicide data in the future. (2) Methodological contribution: While research on citizen data practices typically focuses on case studies, this research will undertake a broader and transnational analysis of these practices across a specific topical domain where there is significant citizen energy and activity. (3) Design contribution: By working in an equitable and participatory way with groups themselves, it will contribute high-level design implications for human-centered computing to support citizen data science about gender-based violence, and center the voices and experiences of such groups in the design process. (4) Generalizability of findings: An assessment of fundamental concepts and research methods explored in this research will provide groundwork for equity-oriented citizen data science beyond the domain of gender-based violence.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
