 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project includes the reduction of honey bee colony mortality by up to 75% through early identification and improved breeding of pest- and disease-resistant colonies. Honey bees are dying at unprecedented rates, with annual losses up to 45% in the United States. A primary cause of colony death is the parasitic mite Varroa. The unhealthy brood odor (UBO) assay is a pheromone-based tool that reduces labor costs required to measure Varroa-resistance by 18x, accelerating decision-making by 20%. The assay\u2019s user-friendly design makes honey bee selection and queen evaluation more accessible to beekeepers, who are often restricted by the high technical skill and/or extensive labor required for existing assays. The UBO assay has potential to improve honey bee health and increase profitability of beekeeping operations, and thus may significantly improve global crop pollination and food security.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will assess the technical feasibility of using a honey bee pheromone-based assay to predict colony-level disease- and pest-resistance. This novel tool has the potential to improve honey bee health, revolutionize honey bee breeding, and inform important apiary management decisions, as it improves efficiency and efficacy of honey bee selection by enabling rapid and accurate identification of Varroa-resistant honey bee colonies. However, to be highly effective and achieve widespread uptake the technology must be practically and economically accessible, must perform consistently despite environmental variability, and must be established as a reliable indicator of heritable Varroa-resistance traits. The proposed research will employ sophisticated behavioral, biochemical, breeding, and manufacturing techniques to optimize prototype efficacy, safety, and delivery, reduce production costs, assess prototype performance across environmental variables, and provide a proof-of-concept for heritability of Varroa-resistance traits identified by colony response to the prototype assay. Expected results include improvements to the safety and efficiency of the product delivery system, improved understanding of the effects of environmental variability on product performance, and confirmation of the heritability of traits identified by honey bee behavioral response to in-hive tests of the product.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

UBeeO<sup>TM</sup> technology utilizes unhealthy brood odors (UBOs) to induce hygienic behavior, the ability of adult bees to detect, uncap, and remove unhealthy brood from the colony, including brood infested with the harmful parasitic mite <em>Varroa</em>. The degree of hygienic response to a small area of UBO-treated cells in a two-hour test (UBeeO<sup>TM</sup>) corresponds to colony <em>Varroa</em> resistance, disease resistance, and winter survival. During NSF Phase I STTR research and development work, Optera completed a substantial amount of high-quality research, establishing the feasibility of UBeeO<sup>TM</sup> for use in selective breeding of pest and disease resistant honey bees. While work remains for Optera to achieve market entry and reach the full potential of UBeeO<sup>TM</sup> technology, four Phase I research objectives were successfully completed during the NSF Phase I STTR project including: 1) Optimization of the prototype to maximize product efficacy and safety, 2) Analysis of the effects of environmental variability on prototype performance, 3) Demonstration of the heritability of UBeeO<sup>TM</sup>-linked traits, and 4) Development of a commercial-ready UBeeO<sup>TM</sup> delivery system.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Optera's progress and achievements during the NSF Phase I STTR project have significantly advanced Optera's ability to successfully and sustainably commercialize UBeeO<sup>TM</sup>, a novel tool to improve honey bee colony health and survival. By enabling rapid and inexpensive identification of <em>Varroa</em> and disease resistant honey bee colonies, UBeeO<sup>TM</sup> has income-generating and cost-saving potential for breeders and beekeepers as it is likely to increase the value of selectively bred honey bee queens, improve honey bee colony survival, reduce apiary labor costs, minimize the need for miticides, and facilitate the reduction of honey bee disease and pest population buildup. Reduced use of miticides and improved pest and disease resistance will result in healthier honey bees, and thus improved natural ecosystem pollination, crop pollination, and food security on a global scale. Furthermore, the Optera's Phase I STTR Research and Development work contributed to a diverse and competitive STEM workforce by directly supporting early-career women scientists with multidisciplinary interests in biochemistry, entomology, entrepreneurship, and public education.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/02/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kaira&nbsp;M&nbsp;Wagoner</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2111970/2111970_10780024_1691001530634_52309071139_556e87a915_n--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2111970/2111970_10780024_1691001530634_52309071139_556e87a915_n--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"In the apiary\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2111970/2111970_10780024_1691001530634_52309071139_556e87a915_n--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"In the apiary\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Business partners Kaira Wagoner and Phoebe Snyder inspect honey bee frames in one of their apiaries during their Phase I STTR project.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UNC Greensboro</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kaira&nbsp;M&nbsp;Wagoner</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">In the apiary</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2111970/2111970_10780024_1691001149146_UBOassay--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2111970/2111970_10780024_1691001149146_UBOassay--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UBeeO Assay\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2111970/2111970_10780024_1691001149146_UBOassay--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UBeeO Assay\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Kaira Wagoner points out the location of the UBeeO test on a honey bee frame.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UNC Greensboro</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kaira&nbsp;M&nbsp;Wagoner</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UBeeO Assay</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2111970/2111970_10780024_1691000969434_Solution-Hygienicresponse--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2111970/2111970_10780024_1691000969434_Solution-Hygienicresponse--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UBeeO Test Before and After\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2111970/2111970_10780024_1691000969434_Solution-Hygienicresponse--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UBeeO Test Before and After\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Before and after photos of a UBeeO test in a hygienic colony</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kaira Wagoner</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kaira&nbsp;M&nbsp;Wagoner</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UBeeO Test Before and After</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2111970/2111970_10780024_1691002169268_Screenshot2023-04-20at4.08.09PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2111970/2111970_10780024_1691002169268_Screenshot2023-04-20at4.08.09PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UBeeO applicator prototype testing\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2111970/2111970_10780024_1691002169268_Screenshot2023-04-20at4.08.09PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UBeeO applicator prototype testing\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Optera tests their new applicator prototype during Phase I STTR field trials</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Phoebe Snyder</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kaira&nbsp;M&nbsp;Wagoner</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UBeeO applicator prototype testing</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
