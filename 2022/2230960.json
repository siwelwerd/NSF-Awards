 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite significant technological advances in modeling and simulating natural hazard impacts on society, disaster resilience is, at its heart, a matter of human resilience. Thus, while engineers and social scientists have each made important strides in their respective fields, reducing the impacts of disasters on communities will ultimately require that researchers begin working across disciplines, not only within nations but across nations. Noting in particular the considerable investments made by the US and Japan to study and ultimately mitigate the impact of disasters in their respective countries, an important first step in fostering such cross-disciplinary and cross-national collaborations in disaster research can be achieved by bringing together the research communities cultivated by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and US National Science Foundation (NSF). In response, the US-Japan Workshop on Needs, Priorities and Partnerships to Advance Human-Centered Data for Resilience will virtually convene these communities over multiple days with the primary goal of identifying opportunities where US-Japan collaborations can uniquely advance a more human-centered approach to research on disaster resilience. A series of one-page briefings will be developed based on workshop learnings (published in English and Japanese) to offer a concise roadmap for possible future joint JST and NSF research opportunities. Ultimately, this roadmap and the interactions between participants will drive new lines of research and collaboration intended to reduce the risk of future disasters in both the US and Japan.\r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary workshop is intentionally designed to incubate future US-Japanese collaborations by exploring important questions such as: (1) How can the human dimensions of disaster impacts be more accurately captured and represented in the analysis, modeling and simulation of disasters?, (2) What type of data and supporting research infrastructure would be necessary to enable novel, transdisciplinary approaches to answering these and other human-centered disaster questions?, and (3) In what ways can US-Japan collaborations advance these questions in new and important ways? The online activities strategically blend asynchronous and synchronous convening mechanisms to navigate time zone differences, accommodating different communication/problem solving styles and levels of language proficiency by providing multiple mechanisms to engage during real-time discussions. The hybrid model further uses Position Papers, submitted in advance, to pre-populate workshop discussions and offer those who come forward with bold ideas a larger platform for sharing their ideas through plenary-style Lightning Talks and Rapid Panels. The workshop\u2019s live sessions will use interactive Miro boards in breakout room discussions to systematically establish the important link between compelling research questions/opportunities and underlying research infrastructure/data needs, subsequently mapping strengths, assets and opportunities for novel US-Japanese partnerships in response to these needs. The hybrid approach of preparatory asynchronous activities and well-structured synchronous activities increases the likelihood of discovering concrete recommendations for future collaborative efforts between the two countries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The workshop solicited applications and ultimately invited nearly 40 leading experts in the natural and applied sciences, engineering and social sciences, from the US and Japan, to identify opportunities where US-Japan collaborations can uniquely advance a more human-centered approach to research on disaster resilience. Each of these scholars authored a Position Paper offering their perspectives on the opportunities to better capture the human dimensions of disasters, leveraging available data and research infrastructure where appropriate, and the potential for US-Japan collaborations to advance these opportunities. Then during the four-session workshop, their ideas were used as a seed to spur collaborative brainstorming and development of prioritized opportunities in small groups, which were carefully assigned to ensure disciplinary, methodological and cultural diversity. They worked in web-based visual environments called Miro boards that emulate the post-it note and whiteboard environments used in physical convenings.

This framework will guide the other three Opportunity Areas. Opportunity Area 2 would establish a US-Japan shared infrastructure for cross-national, interdisciplinary collection of longitudinal human-centered resilience data following disaster events, including data collection workflows and protocols for participants to generate pre-event baseline and post-event impact, response, and recovery data. This data will be a key input into Opportunity Area 3, which seeks to establish a multi-scale modeling environment that can incorporate diverse forms of data (physical, social, and cyber) to simulate impacts and recovery for multiple (possibly cascading) hazards, as well as human actions at various scales, from individual risk perceptions to policy interventions, with the ability to incorporate wide-ranging sources of uncertainty.&nbsp; The environment&rsquo;s ability to simulate human responses to disaster scenarios will benefit from Opportunity Area 4, which aims to develop the next generation of human decision models to (1) capture how humans perceive and respond to risks in different hazard and cultural contexts and (2) use this understanding of decision processes to advance risk communication capabilities accordingly.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>These Opportunity Briefs and a detailed workshop report, along with the position papers of the participants and interactive forums for their ongoing collaboration, were maintained on the workshop website.

Facilitation strategies were similarly successful in promoting cross-cultural, interdisciplinary community visioning and navigating divergent gender and/or cultural norms during discussions. More than half of the invited participants and attendees joining the plenary sessions actively participated in discussions through verbal or written (Zoom chat) contributions.
