 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Division of Chemistry, Professor Martin Burke at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is organizing a workshop to discuss the optimal design of a midscale national facility for automated chemical synthesis that would act as a nexus point for the creation and organization of synthetic data to address critical needs in our ability to make molecules, democratize molecular innovation beyond synthetic experts, and provide opportunities to powerfully accelerate advances in core research areas critical to our national welfare and security. While the use of automated processes for the preparation of biomolecules, particularly DNA and proteins, has revolutionized the advancement of research in biology over the past two decades, challenges associated with the autonomous linkage of a wide range of different substructural chemical fragments have hampered the development of similar systems for the complete synthesis of organic molecules such as small-molecule pharmaceuticals, materials, and fine chemicals. Recent transformative advances in chemistry, robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing have yielded new technologies that have the potential to overcome these hurdles and make automated chemical synthesis across a wider swath of chemical space possible. This workshop will consider the best way to organize a facility to maintain national competitiveness with the rapidly growing demand for molecules, to effectively function in a field that has not previously been facility-focused, and to serve as a disruptive game-changer for synthetic chemistry and all disciplines that benefit from on-demand synthesis of non-commercial compounds. Synergistically, the workshop will also consider unique training opportunities that a midscale facility for chemical synthesis could enable and how the broadening of access to chemical synthesis via automation could be leveraged to advance community engagement, education, and the diversification of innovation.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will bring together experts in synthetic automation, traditional synthetic chemistry, artificial intelligence, user interfaces, and analytical instrumentation integration with potential end users in material and biotechnology applications, educators focused on training for future chemical careers, and directors of established facilities to discuss critical design elements for a mid-scale automated synthesis facility. Through a series of carefully organized breakout sessions, participants will explore ideas for: 1) establishing a facility that supports an ecosystem for democratized molecular innovation, 2) critical infrastructure design elements, 3) plans for operation and maintenance, and 4) key aspects of training and education. Molecular innovation discussions will include what is needed to support the advance of chemical synthesis, the demand for new molecules in materials science and biotechnology, and the integration of industrial collaboration for improved data sharing. Facility design breakout sessions will include topics such as robotics and software needs, chemical analysis integration, and user interface. Operation and maintenance planning will consider options for running and maintaining such a facility post-construction. Training and education discussions will consider the skills and experiences necessary to support a disruptive next-generation community of molecule makers. Integration of workshop outcomes into a synthesized report is planned, to address the needs and priorities of intersecting scientific communities regarding the design of a mid-scale facility for automated chemical synthesis and democratized molecular innovation.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The National Science Foundation sponsored the workshop, and participants included chemists, scientists from other fields, and many non-specialists. The heart of the matter was clear: The world desperately needs new molecules with new functions, and we need a first-of-its-kind infrastructure to help find them. Workshop participants agreed that the possibilities are endless, and they mentioned specific ideas that engendered exceptional levels of interest. Among the ideas related to Intellectual Merit were new materials, both stable and efficient, for converting sunlight to storable energy; new therapeutics to combat intractable cancers that disproportionally affect marginalized groups; and new chemistry that opens new frontiers for further advanced functional discovery in the future. A key concept at the workshop was to start with a desired function and then discover a molecule that meets this need. Important ideas also emerged about how the new national facility can achieve Broader Impacts. Specifically. workshop attendees stressed that this should be a mission-oriented facility, providing an innovative infrastructure for teams of researchers to collaborate to drive frontier molecular innovation in ways never thought possible. What&rsquo;s more, anyone should be able to participate in this exciting process. The workshop explored the use of automation and AI in chemical synthesis, which creates a unique partnership between humans and machines. Automation frees scientists from the mechanical aspects so they can concentrate on ideas and innovation, while AI puts high-speed analysis at chemists&rsquo; fingertips. The gathered community also suggested that the new facility give a high priority to collaborations with non-specialists; it should aim to democratize molecule-making by tapping into the imaginations of citizen scientists from around the world, and thereby broadly enabling the creation of a highly diverse molecular innovation workforce for the future. Some pointed out that democratization has happened in other scientific fields, and it can happen in chemistry. NASA enlists thousands of people from around the world, and their citizen scientists have discovered new planets and comets. Computer science has also successfully been democratized, teaching computer programming to kids as young as third grade through groundbreaking platforms such as Scratch. If anyone can find new planets, and if anyone can code, then anyone can help in the search for new molecules. As chemistry opens its doors to wider participation, the group at the two-day workshop recognized the need for forward-looking safety and ethical protocols. A spokesperson from a leading biotechnology company, Ginkgo Bioworks, talked to the attendees about how they have grappled with these very issues in the synthetic biology space, providing an inspiring roadmap for success. By inviting outside speakers to share their experiences, workshop planners took a unique approach&mdash;learning by analogy. To discover how people from disparate fields have wrestled with similar challenges, workshop planners also brought in speakers from Aero, an innovative new airline; Sony AI; and even Minecraft, the worldwide gaming sensation. Workshop participants envisioned the National Facility for Democratized Molecular Innovation to be a facility like no other. As ideas ricocheted around the workshop, one of the participants suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re aiming to build a James Webb Telescope for chemistry!&rdquo; The analogy was fitting. The James Webb Telescope, launched on December 25, 2021, is the most powerful telescope in space. Originally named the Next Generation Telescope, it has the resolution and sensitivity to pick up objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Telescope to see. It allows astronomers to stare deeper into space than ever before. Similarly, workshop participants dreamed together of a National Facility for Democratized Molecular Innovation, which will enable chemists to probe deeper into chemical space than ever before. After two transformative days, the group vigorously concluded that we simply had to build this next-generation molecular function-generating facility to broadly empower the discovery of tomorrow&rsquo;s molecular solutions.
