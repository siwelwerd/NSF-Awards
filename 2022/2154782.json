 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the Rutgers Geometric Analysis Conference held May 16-20, 2022, on the College Avenue Campus of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick. The conference is a five-day meeting with a one-day summer school comprising three mini-courses and four days of research talks by twenty-one leading mathematicians from the United States and Europe. The scientific themes of the event include geometric analysis, mathematical physics, and applications to low-dimensional topology and symplectic geometry. The participants will interact with a distinguished and diverse group of mathematical leaders and rising stars. The conference aims to generate transfers of knowledge, new collaborations, and a cross-fertilization of ideas, and further inspire graduate students and early-career mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThere has been exciting recent progress in geometric analysis, mathematical physics, and applications to low-dimensional topology and symplectic geometry. For example, geometric flows are of great current interest due to their many applications. For Ricci flow, there has been progress in understanding the structure of solutions, their singularities, their asymptotic limits, and uniqueness. Flows starting from more general initial data (for example, a metric space, or a manifold with unbounded curvature, or an incomplete metric) are becoming better understood. An improved understanding of Ricci flow may lead to advances in areas such as general relativity, string theory, low-dimensional topology, and renormalization in quantum field theory. Further study of mean curvature flow may lead to advances in general relativity, image processing, material science, and minimal surfaces. The meeting will bring together experts at the frontier of research in these areas from around the world.\r\n\r\nThe conference website is: https://www.sas.rutgers.edu/cms/finmath/geometric-analysis-conf-2022\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
