 "awd_abstract_narration": "To promote the progress of science, systemic inequities must be addressed. For example, the disparate research-support infrastructures of minority-serving institutions (MSIs) and Research I (R1) institutions create an imbalanced playing field for winning grants. Through additional funding and infrastructure building, MSIs can build research capacity, which will increase the representation of MSIs in STEM funding. This project seeks to broaden the participation of investigators from minority-serving institutions (MSIs) who are underrepresented in extramural funding. To achieve these goals, a conference will be held at Spelman College to promote synergistic and strategic collaborations between experts in research development (RD) and broader impacts (BI) work with leadership at Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs), historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and Tribal colleges and universities (TCUs). Conference discussion and activities will identify needs of MSIs in RD support, build collaborative teams, and establish priorities for future research on RD infrastructure at MSIs. \r\n \r\nIn 2022, out of 101 HBCUs, no HBCU was ranked with an R1 classification; further, only 11 HBCUs were R2 classified. MSIs need stronger research support infrastructure to develop research ideas and relationships with sponsors, which can be critical to staying up to date on federal funding priorities. Improving this infrastructure would help advance STEM talent at MSIs and lead to numerous impactful scientific advances. The conference will (a) organize and facilitate a workshop to examine current RD infrastructure at MSIs and develop tangible plans to synergize growth, (b) establish relationships both among MSIs and between MSIs and research organizations (Center for Advancing Research Impact in Society, National Organization of Research Development Professionals), and leaders at research intensive universities for the purpose of strengthening RD infrastructure, and (c) create a network of institutions and individuals who will actively work to address the greatest need(s) identified in the report. Spelman College, the National Organization of Research Development Professionals and the Center for Advancing Research Impact in Society will host this conference. This convening is well positioned to produce thoughtful insight on the current best practices and future needs for strengthening the research enterprise at MSIs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
