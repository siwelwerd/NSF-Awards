The purpose of this project is to organize a National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored online workshop named ``Redefining the Future of Computer Architecture from First Principles (Arch-1)\". The workshop will be held at the end of March 2022. The participation in the workshop will be by invitation only, and the majority of the participants will be invited from academia, industry, government laboratories, and funding agencies by considering the representations of the expertise from all relevant research pillars. Underrepresented groups will be particularly encouraged to attend the workshop and receive priority in the considerations. This workshop will provide a forum for leading experts in the relevant research thrusts of computer architecture, specifically architecture, compiler, operating systems, software stack, system integration, and applications, to brainstorm the latest research progress and discuss their visions of redefining the future of computer architecture in the next 10-15 years.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
