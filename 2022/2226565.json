EBRPSS is developing a \u201cfocus choice\u201d grades 6-12 school that is analogous to the LSU College of the Coast and Environment (CC&E). The goal is to develop a pre-college curriculum that will articulate with CC&E\u2019s interdisciplinary Coastal Environmental Science B.S. Program, which is heavily underpinned with rigorous STEM courses. CC&E, in partnership with LSU\u2019s College of Human Sciences and Education, will help develop curriculum focused on hands-on, place-based learning and provide EBRPSS teachers with professional development opportunities that enable them to master the material that they will teach.\r\n\r\nThe EBRPSS is fast-tracking this new environmental school and aims to begin with a first cohort of sixth grade students in the fall 2022 semester. LSU faculty will develop a two-week Summer Institute Workshop focusing on curriculum development and teacher professional development, as well as assistance leading up to the first day of classes in August. The new school is located 2.2 miles from the CC&E campus, and a neighboring school is 93% minority students. The new public school will educate a drastically underserved population, offer students a strong science foundation, and engage them in local environmental and geoscience topics. The overall aim of this \u201cSchool of Environmental Studies and Coastal Studies\u201d is to educate diverse cohorts of students who can matriculate directly to LSU, particularly in the College of the Coast and Environment\u2019s Coastal Environmental Science B.S. degree, or in other LSU programs with an environmental focus.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
