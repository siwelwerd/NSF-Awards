 "awd_abstract_narration": "The LIGO, Virgo and Kagra (LVK) gravitational wave (GW) detectors are detecting large numbers of merging compact astrophysical objects (neutron stars and black holes) in our Universe via gravitational wave observations.  An important area of investigation is how these pairs of compact objects form, come together and merge within the age of the Universe.  Several clues are emerging from LIGO-Virgo GW observations that suggest that active galactic nuclei, where supermassive black holes are fed by disks of hot, bright gas, may be a significant contributor to observed compact object mergers.  A research group at the CUNY Borough of Manhattan Community College and American Museum of Natural History will rewrite, improve and publicly release to the astronomy community a software package they have developed to study this AGN formation channel.  As part of this project, the lead investigators will work with a program called AstroCom NYC, designed to increase diversity in astrophysics research, by involving under-represented minority undergraduate students directly in research as well as encouraging research at minority-serving institutions.\r\n\r\nSome of the clues linking AGN to compact object mergers include the broken power-law mass distribution of black holes, intermediate mass black hole formation, and asymmetric mass merger events (particularly between black holes and neutron stars).  The Monte Carlo code the investigators have developed has made several original predictions about the AGN channel and by publicly releasing it, they will help population modelers in the broader community to test AGN channel priors compared with other channels and move the field towards an understanding of AGN and the embedded objects within them.  This will also accelerate model development and LVK populations modelling across the community as LVK O4 (observing run 4) begins.   This project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
