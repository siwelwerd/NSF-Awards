 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a cryogen-free Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS DynaCool). This instrument enables new interdisciplinary experimental capability of materials research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). The PPMS will significantly accelerate the material research program at UAB physics which heavily depends on the characterization of a multitude of material properties. Furthermore, the PPMS will facilitate new collaborations with other materials research groups at UAB, Historically Black College and University, Primary Undergraduate Institution, and private research institution. The new capability will enable the department\u2019s success as a materials research and education hub in the central Alabama area. The instrument directly benefits the education and training of diverse graduate and undergraduate students, high-school students, and STEM teachers through research, education, and outreach activities. Exhibits on the advanced characterization of materials properties and applications will be developed and used in outreach programs at McWane Science Center in Birmingham to promote science literacy in the general public and inspire K-12 in pursuit of education and careers in STEM areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS) will catalyze materials research at UAB. The multi-functional measurement modules with cryogenic temperature down to 1.9 K coupled with an external magnetic field up to 9 T will enable a broad spectrum of materials research projects including i) pressure control of topological magnetic materials, ii) studying of magnetic transitions in rare earth metals under extreme pressure, iii) determining charge carrier of ultra-wide band gap semiconductors for electronic applications, iv) discovery and characterization of novel laser materials, v) enabling excitonic physics in hybrid perovskite systems at cryogenic condition for energy and optoelectronic applications, vi) expanding the analysis methods for functional nanofibers, and vii) discovering new superconductors with superlattice structures. The success of current ongoing research activities at UAB physics depends on the characterization of a multitude of material properties including electrical transport/superconductivity, magnetism, thermal, and optical properties under external stimuli (temperature, pressure, and magnetic field). The new capability will expand research in quantum materials, foster new intra-departmental and inter-institutional collaborations, and promote the training of a skilled STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
