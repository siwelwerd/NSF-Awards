 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photosynthetic marine microorganisms, or phytoplankton, use carbon dioxide to build their \r\nbiomass. When phytoplankton die and sink, they transfer this carbon to the deep ocean, \r\nsequestering it away from the atmosphere. This process, known as the biological pump, has \r\ntempered the effect of climate change through the absorption of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. \r\nThe efficiency of the biological pump \u2013 and the ocean\u2019s continued ability to absorb carbon dioxide \r\nin the future \u2013 will depend on the ability of different phytoplankton groups to adapt to effects of \r\nclimate change, such as warming and acidification. In order to quantify how the cumulative effects \r\nof subcellular processes will determine the amount of carbon dioxide phytoplankton use in future \r\noceans, this research tests the adaptability of different phytoplankton groups to the expected \r\nconditions in year 2100 and year 2500 oceans. This project will train a postdoctoral researcher, a \r\nPh.D. student, four summer undergraduate interns, and support the professional development of a \r\nfemale, first-time investigator, and early career researcher in collaboration with a senior scientist. \r\nThe work will promote innovative solutions to societal challenges through the operation and \r\nimprovement of a national mentoring program designed to increase diversity in climate related \r\nfields by providing students interested in pursuing graduate degrees in climate and Earth sciences \r\nwith mentors to support their career development. \r\n\r\nCarbon fixation in today\u2019s oceans proceeds through CO2-concentration mechanisms (CCMs) that \r\nimprove the efficiency of carbon fixation by increasing CO2 concentrations at site of carbon \r\nfixation. CCMs have evolved independently within different groups of phytoplankton resulting in \r\ndistinct types of CCMs with convergent functions. Continued anthropogenic CO2 emissions are \r\nforcing phytoplankton to adapt to the impacts of climatic change at an accelerating pace. Individual \r\ncomponents of CCMs are known to respond to the effects of climate change including pH, the \r\nconcentration of dissolve inorganic carbon, and temperature. The cumulative response of CCMs \r\nat the subcellular level represents the organismal response of phytoplankton to climate change, \r\nwith direct implications for the efficiency of carbon fixation in future oceans. The primary goal of \r\nthis project is to quantify the adaptive response of CCMs to the selective drivers of climate change \r\nthrough the experimental evolution of five phytoplankton groups with distinct CCMs, including a \r\ndiatom, dinoflagellate, green alga, coccolithophore, and a cyanobacterium. Specific project \r\nobjectives include 1) quantify the plastic and adaptive carbon fixation response of relevant marine \r\nphytoplankton to multiple \u2018year 2100\u2019 climate change stressors; 2) quantify the plastic and \r\nadaptive carbon fixation response of relevant marine phytoplankton to multiple climate change \r\nstressors in an extreme (\u2018year 2500\u2019) scenario; and 3) resolve how the subcellular components \r\ncontribute to the organismal CCM response of phytoplankton that underlies the ecosystem-scale \r\nimpact of carbon fixation in future oceans.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
