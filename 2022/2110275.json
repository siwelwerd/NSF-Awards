 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the worldwide issue of how biofouling (unwanted attachment of biological species, e.g., barnacles, oysters, mussels) of ships is addressed. The current antifouling methods are harmful to the environment (toxic paints are employed and they can pollute waterways) and costly in terms of maintenance to mitigate biofouling and the increased fuel costs due to frictional drag during a vessel\u2019s operation. This project seeks to develop an innovative, electronic approach to biofouling prevention by developing ultrasonic transducer arrays that are optimized for submerged operation in a marina. The near-term commercial opportunity is with both marina owners and nationwide marina operators. Over time and with further product development, commercial transport and large Navy vessels may also be addressed. This project seeks to enhance the scientific understanding of acoustic wave generation in water using piezoelectric transducers and sensor arrays along with the understanding of how these waves prevent the attachment of bio-species to ship hulls.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to address the challenges of commercial deployment of transducer and sensor arrays to prevent biofouling of ships docked in marinas. The program has four scientific objectives: 1) Improve transducer and power amplifier components and construction to maximize sound pressure levels in water; 2) Develop and construct complex coherent transducer arrays to project adequate sound pressure levels at distances greater than 10 feet to prevent biofouling agents from attaching to ships; 3) Integrate sensor arrays into an autonomous system that can adjust sound pressure levels based on feedback algorithms; and 4) Develop a proof-of-concept system to adopt an autonomous, electronically steerable transducer array system to the interior of boat hulls. This latter adaptation may open markets where large ships such as commercial transport and Naval vessels can be addressed.  The project will innovate in areas such as acoustic beam steering, electronic design of piezoelectric transducers, acoustic amplifier design, submersible marine electronics, and electro/mechanical design for submersible housings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

The long-standing solution to controlling biofouling is using Toxic Antifouling Paints on the hull and manually scraping fouling structures off the paint by divers. This causes paint to be released into the Sea Beds, creating more toxicity than the leaching of heavy metals into the water from the antifouling paint.

WaveArray has developed three systems. The first is the Slip Array system that surrounds a boat in a slip and protects the entire underwater ship's hull. Figure 2 shows a 62-foot yacht customer installation on Marco Island, FL. WaveArray's latest and most ambitious installation is on a 130 ft Yacht in Boca Ratan, Fl., see Figure 3.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>WaveArray has also developed systems designed to help Marinas with their biofouling problems. One is for a floating dock pillar, the Dock Array, a type of dock in which rollers on a cement Pillar allow the dock to float up and down with the tide. If a pillar gets fouled, the rollers can get stuck, causing the dock to break. Marinas have had costly repairs due to this problem. In Figure 4, you can see the fouling occurring without the WaveArray system and no fouling in the critical area of the pillar with the WaveArray system.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A Cable Array was designed to address a nasty problem Marinas encountered. As you can see in Figure 5, very heavy fouling occurs on the Cables that connect the floating dock to the marina's fixed infrastructure.
