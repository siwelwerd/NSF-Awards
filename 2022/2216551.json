 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organisms use diverse strategies to meet their nutritional needs and maintain a healthy body condition so they may survive and reproduce. This doctoral dissertation project examines the behavior, nutrition, and energetics of a wild primate to assess how a fruit-specialist responds to environmental unpredictability and prolonged periods of fruit scarcity, as well as how these responses may change in response to habitat disturbance. The project facilitates the training and dissertation data collection of a student in behavioral and nutrition methods; implements training workshops for local research staff and international scholars; and provides lab-based research opportunities for several undergraduate and masters students at a minority-serving institution. The research can promote the conservation of a critically endangered species by monitoring the health of populations living in differentially disturbed habitats and predicting outcomes of human-driven habitat disturbance. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to improve our understanding primate dietary flexibility and their subsequent responses to ecological change. Some primates, including some lemurs, are described as being \u2018energetically frugal\u2019, employing a combination of energy-saving traits in response to harsh, often unpredictable environments. Several studies have examined primate behavior in response to seasonal changes in climate and food availability, but additional quantification of behavioral responses to nutrition or energy levels may help to further explain the pronounced behavioral flexibility characteristic of many lemur species, particularly in light of ongoing human-driven habitat disturbance. The project proposes four objectives: (1) investigate the relationships between climate, resource availability, and behavior across space and time; (2) examine how lemurs balance nutrient intakes in response to changes in food availability and forest quality; (3) examine the role of minerals in the diet; and (4) elucidate variation in energy balance.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
