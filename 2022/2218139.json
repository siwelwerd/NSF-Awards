 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the attendance and participation of graduate students, early-career scientists, and independent scholars at thirty-eight Science and Technology Studies (STS) conferences organized by eleven STS societies over a four-year period. It does so by removing the financial barriers to entry that frequently prevent junior STS scholars from attending professional conferences. Grant beneficiaries will become better integrated in the international and interdisciplinary STS community by gaining access to new scientific networks, receiving feedback designed to facilitate publication, and disseminating their research findings. \r\n \r\nThis grant will also support the cultivation of a more diverse and inclusive STS community. To facilitate this, all participating societies will collect demographic data about applicants and travel grant recipients. They will also collect demographic data on all conference attendees to better assess the role this grant will play in increasing diversity across the eleven societies. These findings will be of interest to members of the eleven societies, educators, university administrators, policymakers, and the public. They will be made available to these audiences through broadly circulated official reports and public-facing media.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
