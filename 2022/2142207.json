 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing an institutional change model to enhance course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) in STEM disciplines. Undergraduate research is a high-impact educational practice shown to increase student persistence and success in STEM. Embedding research into courses has the potential to reach more students, including those from diverse backgrounds, than the traditional apprentice model of undergraduate research. This Capacity-Building Institutional and Community Transformation project will develop a model of institutional change to support the integration of quality CUREs in STEM disciplines. Once published, other institutions can use this change model to advance CUREs at their institution.\r\n\r\nThe project has the following goals: (1) conduct a needs assessment to understand the gaps and opportunities for implementing CUREs; (2) develop a Community of Practice to facilitate the advancement of CUREs, bringing together diverse stakeholders both internal and external to the institution; and (3) develop a strategic plan for CUREs in STEM disciplines at the university. Achievement of these goals will be informed by a Theory of Change developed after the needs assessment. Data collection will include surveys, interviews, and focus groups with stakeholders, followed by an analysis of artifacts related to CUREs, such as tenure and promotion guidelines, syllabi, and student reflections. The final product will be a strategic plan for CUREs at Kennesaw State University. Ultimately, this project will expand the number of CUREs at this institution as well as the quality of those experiences for students. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
