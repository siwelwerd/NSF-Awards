 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Broadening Participation Research (BPR) in STEM Education projects supports the development, implementation, and study of new theory-driven models and innovations related to the participation and success of underrepresented groups in STEM undergraduate education. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, as well as improve the recruitment, retention, and success of underrepresented groups in STEM education and the workforce. This project at Bowie State University seeks to examine P-12 social-emotional learning (SEL) education policy and its potential impact on equity in STEM Education. The researchers plan to conduct policy analyses and qualitative interviews culminating in recommendations to inform state-level policy focused on ensuring equity and excellence in STEM Education and SEL for Black students. Moreover, the recommendations will offer ways to implement policies that promote equity in STEM.\r\n\r\nThis project has one overarching research question:  To what extent do states implement education policy that supports Black student social-emotional learning and drive district-level implementation toward equitable STEM education? To address this question, a qualitative document analysis study of state and district social-emotional learning education and STEM policies, as well as a thematic analysis will be conducted.  This study has five objectives:  (1)  to conduct a state and district-level policy analysis to assess equity and SEL (Transformative SEL (TSEL));  (2) to examine how state SEL policy aligns with school district-level policy; (3) to understand how state and district policy provides guidance on the implementation of TSEL into the STEM curriculum; (4) to understand the factors that contribute to or prohibit the integration of TSEL into STEM curriculum; and (5) to contribute to the STEM and SEL policy knowledge base with concrete recommendations geared toward ensuring Black students thrive in STEM and beyond.  This work has the potential to expand knowledge about equity in social-emotional learning policy, provide an understanding of how social-emotional learning policy intersects with state standards in STEM policy, and document policy links (or missing links) between state and local education agencies that are essential for shaping STEM education to ensure all students, and particularly Black students, thrive.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
