 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Esker group is developing thin film production capabilities at San Jos\u00e9 State University (SJSU). These specialized thin films, known as \u201ctargets\u201d, are to be used in nuclear reactions at particle accelerator facilities to produce and study nuclei far from stability. A central focus of this project is producing and studying the excited states in Indium-100 (100In) using an Iron-54 (54Fe) target and a Chromium-50 (50Cr) beam. 100In is 13 neutrons away from the lightest stable indium isotope Indium-113 (113In) and has never been studied in this type of reaction. It is of particular interest because it is the nearest neighbor to the doubly magic Tin-100 (100Sn), which has long been a focus of experimental efforts. An important component in establishing the target capabilities at SJSU is the introduction and education of undergraduate research students in nuclear science. SJSU is a primarily undergraduate minority serving institution (PUI & MSI), and nuclear science is a rarity at both of these institutions. The inclusive research experience supported by this project will help to broaden the nuclear science pipeline, especially for women and under-represented minority students.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to support the target work of the Esker group as well as supporting the production of an 54Fe target.  This target will be used in a 54Fe(50Cr, p3n) 100In reaction to be run at TRIUMF using the EMMA + TIGRESS experimental set-up.  This will support the approved experiment S2023, to investigate the nuclear structure of 100In, the \u03b2-decay daughter of 100Sn.  This region of the nuclear landscape has a number of exciting features that make it a focus of experimental and theoretical efforts: the doubly magic shell closure around N = 50 and Z = 50, the enhancement of np interactions along the N = Z symmetry line, and the close proximity to the proton dripline. By populating the high spin states in the odd-odd nucleus 100In and watching its subsequent decay, the group expects to greatly expand the known structure of this isotope.  This experiment would provide valuable information to further develop theoretical descriptions of nuclear behavior in this region.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
