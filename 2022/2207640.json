 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics, and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's \"Windows on the Universe\" Big Idea. Humankind's exploration of the gravitational-wave universe began with the National Science Foundation's Advanced LIGO observation of the collision of two black holes in 2015. This breakthrough started a revolution in astrophysics that is still ongoing and that is directly driven by the detector's sensitivity. This project tackles the most limiting noise in terrestrial gravitational-detectors: quantum noise, thermal noise, and the numerous actuator-related noise couplings at low frequency. Its goals are to enable Advanced LIGO to overcome the current quantum and thermal noise limitations, and to collaborate with the LIGO Laboratory to address the diverse noise sources at low frequencies, enabling gravitational-wave detectors to continue to unravel the mysteries of the universe.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this award is funding i) Developing and deploying of novel phase front sensors for characterizing and controlling the optical wave front in gravitational-wave interferometers with a high arm cavity laser power, ii) Support for commissioning high power operations and improved sensitivity for Advanced LIGO A+ in preparation for the O4 and O5 observation runs, and iii) Research and design work for integrating new crystalline optical coatings (AlGaAs), test mass actuators and wave front control elements into post-O5 Advanced LIGO and Cosmic Explorer.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
