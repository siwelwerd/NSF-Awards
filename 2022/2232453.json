 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by equipping chemistry and mathematics large-enrollment course (with 100+ students) instructors with the tools needed to carry out quality research involving the scholarship of teaching and learning. A series of three workshops will help instructors develop research questions and use appropriate tools to assess the effectiveness of engagement strategies employed in the classroom. Results could improve student retention in chemistry and mathematics large-enrollment courses. By bringing together mathematics and chemistry faculty, the project intends to stimulate cross-disciplinary ideas and future collaborations. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to bring together mathematics and chemistry educators who teach large-enrollment courses to increase these individuals' capacity to produce sound, high-quality research. Groups of two researchers from eight institutions (16 total participants) will be recruited to attend a pre-conference workshop, a main conference, and a post-conference workshop. Each gathering will be centered on preparing a research plan, including research questions, methodology, and data analysis. This project will provide opportunities for participants to discuss obstacles to engagement faced in large-enrollment courses across different institutions. Participants will also receive resources and connections to continue their professional development and challenge their teaching and creative activity and research ideas. This project hopes to enhance collaborations with faculty from not only different disciplines at different institutions but also from various backgrounds. In addition to promoting diversity in different fields and backgrounds, this project will also help increase the participants\u2019 capacity to produce high-quality research, which will, in turn, help increase participation and retention of students in STEM fields, especially in early-college mathematics and chemistry large-enrollment courses. Participants' research projects, as well as conference evaluation, will generate knowledge about engagement in STEM large-enrollment courses and will inform future conferences and workshops. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
