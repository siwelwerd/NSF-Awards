 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many physical, biological, and social processes are modeled as one or\r\nmore ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with unknown parameters.\r\nUsually there are three fundamental tasks in working with such ODEs: (1)\r\nchecking whether the structure of the ODE even allows these parameters to\r\nbe estimated in principle, (2) if it does, numerically estimating the\r\nparameters, and (3) solving ODEs with the estimated values of the\r\nparameters. Thus, it is crucial to develop tools for the three tasks. Due\r\nto its importance, there has been extensive research on developing\r\nnecessary mathematical theories, algorithms and software tools, with\r\ntremendous progress/achievements. Broadly, there have been two different\r\napproaches: symbolic and numeric, each with its own objective, theory,\r\nalgorithms, and software tools. Roughly put, the symbolic approaches\r\nprioritize correctness over efficiency, while the numeric approaches\r\nprioritize efficiency over correctness. Naturally, they developed (often\r\ndramatically) different sets of theories and algorithms. Consequently,\r\nthere are currently two kinds of software tools: one correct but often\r\ninefficient, the other efficient but often incorrect. Hence, there is an\r\nutmost need and thus a challenge: develop a new approach (theory,\r\nalgorithms) that can yield software tools that are both efficient and\r\ncorrect.  \r\n\r\nIn this project, the investigators propose a novel approach that has a\r\npotential to meet the challenges of efficiency and correctness for\r\nparametric ODEs. The approach may be described by the key phrase\r\n``validated and soft approach''. One may try to develop validated\r\n(correct) algorithms in two ways. (1) Use a symbolic approach. It always\r\nproduces correct output, but is inefficient. (2) Use a numerical interval\r\napproach with modified notion of correctness, e.g., specifying a priori\r\nerror bounds. This allows the use of approximate arithmetic, providing\r\nefficiency, but this is only true for non-singular ODEs. For singular\r\nproblems, there is an implicit ``Zero Problem'' that does not yield to\r\nnumerical approximations, and may not even be Turing-computable. The soft\r\napproach overcomes this limitation by allowing indeterminacy for certain\r\ninputs: informally, inputs on the verge of singularity are allowed to have\r\nindeterminate outputs. The resulting soft formulations of the problems\r\nallow one to exploit and combine strengths of both symbolic and numeric\r\napproaches, resulting in algorithms that are correct (in the modified\r\nsense) and practical (efficient). The investigators' preliminary research\r\nindicates that the validated soft approach is quite promising.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
