 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, will support the training of eight students for ten weeks during the summers of 2022-2024. It is anticipated that a total of 24 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities or from an underrepresented group, will be trained in the program. Participants will be recruited from life science and chemistry majors who have an interest in research. Students will develop the knowledge and problem-solving skills required for careers in life sciences research. The program will contribute to increasing the preparation and diversity of the nation\u2019s science and technology workforce. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. The web-based SALG URSSA assessment tool will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths.\r\n\r\nThe primary intellectual goal of the program is to provide advanced training in the experimental analysis of protein function. A three-day orientation will introduce key concepts in protein biochemistry and experimental design. The remainder of the program will emphasize full-time research supplemented with weekly sessions on ethical conduct in research, professional communication, and applications to graduate school. Faculty mentored projects in the Department of Biochemistry include analysis of enzyme mechanisms, post-translational protein modifications, epigenetic regulation, and protein-nucleic acid interactions studied in a wide range of biological contexts including plant secondary metabolism, photosynthesis, tissue differentiation and the drosophila visual system. Many of the projects will highlight the value of genetic approaches to study protein function. Participants will present their results at a university-wide poster session at the end of the program. Complete applications will include academic transcripts, two letters of recommendation and a personal statement. More information about the program is available by visiting https://ag.purdue.edu/biochem/Pages/REU.aspx, or by contacting the PI (Dr. James Forney at forney@purdue.edu).\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
