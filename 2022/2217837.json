 "awd_abstract_narration": "The deformation behavior of rocks controls the strength of the lithosphere, the location and intensity of earthquakes, the response of Earth to impact events, and the concentration and deposition of ore minerals. To understand the conditions and duration under which rocks deformed in the geologic past, and to improve understanding of earthquake processes, mineral resource identification, and crustal strength modelling, we will conduct a series of experiments on minerals important for geologic age dating. These deformation experiments will be conducted at conditions which simulate environments deep within the Earth\u2019s crust. The principal investigators will fabricate synthetic rock samples embedded with natural mineral grains and use a rock deformation apparatus to impose high stress and strain conditions typical of deep Earth shear zones. The experiments will focus on the deformation behavior of accessory phase minerals titanite and monazite, which are routinely used for petrochronology, a technique which uses radiometric age dating to determine the timing of ancient metamorphic reactions and deformation events. The deformation behavior of the major rock-forming minerals (e.g., quartz, feldspar, olivine) has been well-studied, but our experiments will be among the first to investigate the deformation behavior of accessory phase minerals. Accessory phase minerals, such as monazite, are reservoirs for Rare Earth Elements (REEs) and the results of our experiments will provide better understanding of REE mobilization within fault zones. Societal benefits of the project include direct training of graduate and undergraduate students and a postdoctoral researcher in experimental and analytical skills that are valuable in many high-level government, defense, and industrial laboratories. Outreach efforts will involve developing earth science curricula for Providence, RI elementary school. The Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown has an active outreach program known as the Science-Teaching and Education Program (STEP), which partners with local teachers to develop earth science modules in their classes. The project will also contribute to the broadening of underrepresented groups in STEM. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to experimentally deform a selection of accessory phase minerals and use multiple advanced microanalytical techniques to examine how various deformation and recrystallization mechanisms affect the distribution of elements and isotopes important for geochronology. The researchers will conduct a multi-step experimental protocol consisting of deformation in a Griggs-rig solid medium deformation apparatus followed by high temperature static annealing of a subset of samples. Accessory phases monazite and titanite with well-characterized trace element contents will be embedded as porphyroclasts in a matrix of quartz, synthetic quartz, or feldspar and deformed under prescribed temperatures, pressures, and strain rate conditions. Multiple advanced analytical techniques will allow us to investigate the composition and structure of deformed samples from the aggregate to atomic scale. The principal investigators will quantify the influence of lattice defects on the mobility of impurity elements and consequences of recrystallization for interpreting the geochemistry of deformed minerals. Our results will provide fundamental constraints on the rheological behavior of accessory phase minerals and enable more confident applications of accessory phase geochronology and geothermometry to deformed rocks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
