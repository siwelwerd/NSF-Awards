 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the international GEOTRACES program is to understand the distributions of trace chemical elements and their isotopes in the oceans. This project will generate a dataset of 40 trace elements on suspended particles and surface sediment samples collected on the GEOTRACES GP17-ANT cruise to the Amundsen Sea, West Antarctica. The Amundsen Sea hosts the most productive polynya per unit area in all of Antarctica, with biological carbon uptake ten times higher than the average for the Southern Ocean. Over the past 30 years, this region has become a primary locus of increased freshwater input, as the fastest melting glaciers in West Antarctica deliver huge and increasing volumes of freshwater to the Amundsen Sea. The major contribution of this region to global sea level rise is well documented, but the impact of accelerated additions of meltwater and associated chemical constituents on the biogeochemistry of the Antarctic shelf waters, and in particular on the cycling of trace elements, has not received comprehensive investigation. Hypotheses addressing four key components of the biogeochemical system in the Amundsen Sea will be tested, and results will closely mesh with complementary efforts proposed by other GP17-ANT investigators. The project will support a graduate student and several undergraduate interns, with a focus on broadening participation in STEM. The investigators will also work with established programs to create meaningful out-of-school science experiences for middle and high school students.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to quantify and interpret the distributions of particulate trace elements in approximately 500 samples covering a large swath of the Amundsen Sea shelf, including waters influenced by five major ice shelves, and in the adjacent iron-limited Southern Ocean waters bounded by 100\u00b0W and 135\u00b0W, and south of 67\u00b0S. The investigators will use size-fractionated sample collection, total acid digestion and weak acid leaching, and well-established mass spectrometric methods to determine concentrations and probe the physico-chemical state of the particulate trace elements. The team will use the new data to investigate the following issues: 1) the role of phytoplankton, with a focus on Phaeocystis and diatoms, dominant taxa on the Amundsen Sea shelf, in driving element cycling in the upper water column while experiencing variable degrees of iron stress; 2) the \u201cmeltwater pump\u201d which generates vigorous and particle-rich outflow from ice shelf cavities; 3) the bottom nepheloid layer of resuspended sediments as a reaction zone that determines the composition of the sedimentary paleo-record and also modulates of chemical fluxes at the sediment-water boundary; and 4) the rare earth elements (REE), which the team proposes carry unique geochemical information about terrigenous particle provenance among the geologically diverse glacial drainage regions, and also includes a labile particulate fraction whose magnitude and inter-element ratios may serve as a relative index of element scavenging intensity that can be applied to predict regions of maximal scavenging for other particle-reactive elements.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
