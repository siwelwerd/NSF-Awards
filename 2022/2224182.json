 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of eye care delivery technology empowering patients and shifting aspects of diagnosis and management to the home. Currently, there are no remote, self-use eye imaging options available to patients. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and glaucoma represent leading causes of irreversible vision loss in the US. Early detection, consistent follow-up, and timely treatment are essential in preventing blindness. Remote monitoring removes the patient barriers associated with in-person visits such as time off from work and child care and travel costs and presents an opportunity to improve the quality of care. Studies have demonstrated that home-based testing with increased frequency can detect glaucoma progression over 1.5 years sooner than traditional testing. Early studies in home-based AMD monitoring have also demonstrated higher detection rates for neovascular disease and lower rates of vision loss. In the US, access to ophthalmologic care remains limited; Fewer than half of the 12 million Americans with diabetes undergo screening for retinopathy, and an estimated 2.4 million Americans have undetected glaucoma. Rates of AMD, glaucoma and DR continue to rise precipitously, and addressing the widening gaps in health equity in ophthalmologic care requires new solutions.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a portable, self-administered anterior segment and retinal fundus-imaging device to facilitate evaluation of vision threatening diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma using telemedicine. The proposed device includes instrumentation and software that automates the eye exam, allowing patients to self-image. From the patient\u2019s home, the patient receives remote screening and monitoring of potentially blinding conditions. Alongside this device, the team plans to build a data platform to enable collection, use and sharing of data for tele-ophthalmology services to facilitate remote evaluation with providers. A core aspect of the device is the unique gaze tracking technology which allows automated acquisition of images and improved accuracy/precision by remaining centered on the eye while also allowing assess to other key aspects of ocular health.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
