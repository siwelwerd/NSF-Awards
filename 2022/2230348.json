 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a proposed aerogel wound dressing that may help heal patients with chronic wounds. The total treatment cost for patients with chronic wounds could be reduced as they may heal faster but also possibly require fewer dressing changes eliminating the use of multiple dressings. Since the proposed technology is biodegradable, it is also possible that the technology makes the wound healing process more sustainable.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a class of novel bio-based aerogels for wound dressings, which could help address the current issues in chronic wound-healing today. Aerogels possess a unique combination of high porosity, high surface area, an abundance of mesopores, and capillary action that result in properties like high absorbance, gas exchange, and moisture balance at the wound interface which may create an incubator-like environment that possibly reduces the formation of biofilm and protects the wound from pathogens. Being bio-based the proposed technology may possess increased biocompatibility and biodegradability, as well as possibly providing the wound site with necessary proteins that may improve the healing process. Bio-based aerogel materials have absorbance capacities up to 50 times their weight compared with 7-8 times for popular commercial chronic wound dressings. The physicochemical properties of these materials may be useful for the wound healing environment.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Prevention of infection, maintaining a moist environment, oxygen exchange, thermal insulation, and exudate absorbance are vital functions that chronic wound dressings should perform.&nbsp;The current dressings do not perform these functions. This training grant award allowed the team to evaluate aerogel wound dressings for potential in healing chronic wounds. Our team conducted more than 350 interviews with potential consumers and industry experts such as medical doctors, nurses, chronic wound care patients, founders and executives of wound dressings companies, medical researchers, and hospital commercialization executives to identify a place for proposed products. Our initial idea of highly absorbent dressing for chronic wounds was tested via these interviews first to establish if such products would have a place in the market. Second, we collected other key elements that the next level of wound care materials should have. At the end of customer discovery program, a company Auxilium Health Inc. was launched at the University of Akron to pursue this project with a well-defined value proposition:&nbsp; A bio-based dressing for wound care physicians that closes the wound 50%&nbsp;faster and lasts 3-4 times longer than current dressings, decreasing infection-related complications by over 70% and improving practice efficiency by up to 90%. Finally, we focused on the resources needed for commercialization and the regulatory/reimbursement criteria that must be fulfilled. The start-up - Auxilium Health, Inc. - received $200K in non-dilutive funding (including I-Corps funding) and dilutive funding from various pitch competitions and grants like VentureWell E-Teams Phase I and dilutive funding (TVSF Phase I).
