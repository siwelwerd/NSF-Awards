 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project  explores how a portfolio of combined climate intervention strategies including mitigation, carbon dioxide removal, and solar radiation management could achieve a climate-resilient future. The focus is on scientific research activities concerned with climate outcomes that are responsive to the priorities and needs of diverse stakeholder groups.  The convergent team encompasses experts from climate science, engineering, behavioral science and ecology. This interdisciplinary team will work to transform the climate interventions research landscape, moving it to more integrated approaches for research and assessments. This will be achieved through the establishment of a shared conceptual and theoretical framework for scenario generation, model application, impact assessment and stakeholder translation.\r\n\r\nThe project has three main objectives: 1) Advancing state-of-science climate intervention studies through exploring the assumptions, model deficiencies, interactions, and impact assessment methods of a portfolio of climate intervention scenarios consistent with keeping warming within 1.5 degrees C from CMIP6 baseline pathways, with the climate intervention scenarios based on methods already developed by the project investigators; 2) Developing an approach for co-production of modeling products from Earth system evaluations through extensive stakeholder engagement to further actionable research into combined climate intervention scenarios and their evaluation; and 3) Designing scenario and impact assessment toolkits for the wider community to engage in investigating intervention strategies that are responsive to their unique information needs and priorities through the extension of and adaptation of the co-designed scenarios and assessment frameworks.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
