 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description:\r\nThis major research instrumentation project supports the acquisition of a Zetasizer by Western Washington University (WWU) to enrich collaborative research and curricular efforts across a range of scientific disciplines both on and off campus. The Zetasizer uses scattered light to measure the size and surface charge of particles suspended in liquids, while also providing information such as particle aggregation behavior. The instrument supports more than 10 research groups in fields including materials chemistry, environmental science, biochemistry, engineering, and biomaterials science. This instrument enhances the education of the students at WWU, many of whom go on to graduate schools, industrial positions, or other professional degree programs. Multiple undergraduate courses at WWU utilize the Zetasizer with hundreds of students gaining hands-on experience with the instrument annually. The Zetasizer also benefits research and educational efforts at other regional undergraduate institution partners and is available for use by local industries.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThis instrument enables non-destructive, rapid characterization of surface and physical properties of particles between approximately one nanometer and ten micrometers in size and can assess particle distributions and aggregation directly in solution. The instrument is versatile across broad concentration, temperature, and pH ranges and can measure samples in volumes as small as three microliters. Current research projects that utilize the Zetasizer include topics such as organometallic chemistry, nanomaterial sensors, light-coupled heterogeneous catalysis, polymer and composite synthesis and characterization, environmental contaminant measurement and monitoring, biopolymer preparation, and protein regulation studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
