 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for speakers and participants of the conference \u201cAlgebraic Topology and Topological Data Analysis\u201d to be held at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications in Minneapolis, during August 1-5, 2022. The conference brings together researchers in pure and applied mathematics and data science to promote the progress of the study of shape and its applications to data. Furthering our understanding of the shape of data facilitates data driven discovery in a wide range of fields, including national health. The week-long conference will explore topics at the confluence of the theoretical area of Algebraic Topology and the modern application oriented Topological Data Analysis. As such it has a strong potential to seed new research directions which will not only widen the landscape of topological techniques in data analysis but would also suggest new possible directions within algebraic topology. The conference talks will particularly benefit early career researchers through exposure to some of the latest results across a wide swath of topics in topology and its applications.  \r\n\r\nThis conference will bring together researchers from both traditional aspects within Algebraic Topology with more recently developed techniques such as those from Topological Data Analysis and Applied Algebraic Topology. Conference topics include various flavors of homotopy theory (categorical, stable, motivic), topological vector bundles, Azumaya algebras, K-theory, persistent homology, dimension reduction, topological time series analysis, configuration spaces, and applications to other scientific fields. The conference webpage is https://ima.umn.edu/2021-2022/SW8.1-5.22.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
