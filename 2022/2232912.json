 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is supporting participation by students and early-career researchers in the Mountain Climate (MtnClim) conference to be held September 12-16, 2022. The MtnClim conference is focused on mountain climate sciences and the effects of climate variability on ecosystems and natural resources. The conference features invited and contributed talks, poster sessions, and working-group sessions on various aspects of mountain climate science including hydrology, ecology, and glaciology. Every MtnClim meeting includes sessions or workshops of value to natural-resource managers addressing implications of climate variability and climate change in conservation and resource management. Conference attendees span a range of participants including land managers from agencies and tribes, natural resource practitioners from non-governmental organizations, and academics. The theme of this year\u2019s conference is Science for Decision-Making in Mountains. \r\n\r\nThe award is facilitating access to the conference and increasing the opportunity for student and early-career participants. The participant support is focused on communities traditionally under-represented in the mountain science community as well as early career scientists. In addition to funding students, events will be included at the meeting to foster a sense of belonging and inclusion for students and early career participants. These include panels on diversity, equity, and inclusion, partnering with mentors, peer meetings of student and early career participants, and professional development opportunities. \r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences and Arctic Natural Sciences programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
