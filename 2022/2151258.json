 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Seminar on Stochastic Processes 2022 (SSP) will be held at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on March 16-19, 2022. These seminars have been held annually since 1981, with the exception of 2021. They have become a crucially important regular conference series for probabilists in North America, bringing together a diverse group of accomplished researchers, early-career investigators, and graduate students in probability theory and stochastic processes. The primary goals of SSP 2022 are to provide a platform for the dissemination of the most significant recent progress in the field and to enable participants to discuss their work with others. The five main speakers at SSP 2022 were chosen for their prominence as researchers in stochastic processes and for the collective breadth of their research areas. SSP 2022 will also incorporate activities intended especially for new researchers; these will include two 90-minute tutorial lectures, a poster session with accompanying mini-talks, an open problem session, and a panel discussion on topics of particular interest to early-career researchers. This conference will be an excellent opportunity for students and early-career researchers to learn the latest developments in probability and related topics, and to interact with leading researchers.\r\n\r\nStochastic processes are fundamental to understanding the way randomness occurs in the real world and are used to model a wide variety of physical, biological, ecological, and financial phenomena. This meeting of SSP will address topics including statistical physics, especially problems related to random matrix theory, combinatorics and integrable systems; the structural and dynamical properties of networks and algorithmic game theory, including applications to computer science; stochastic partial differential equations, large-scale interacting systems, and random interface models; and stochastic processes motivated by population genetics, such as branching Brownian motion and the spatial Lambda Fleming-Viot process. Financial support to attend the conference will be preferentially given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and other under-represented or marginalized groups, as well as to early-career faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference. More information will be disseminated, and kept, at the conference webpage: https://wordpress.lehigh.edu/ssp2022/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
