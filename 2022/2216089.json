 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to acquire a state-of-the-art Trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry (TIMS) Time of Flight (TOF) fleX with Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI). This instrument offers several unique capabilities: 1) TIM separation allows separating isomeric compounds. These compounds have the same molecular formula, but different chemical properties; 2) TOF enables full mass-spectrum analysis and is able to separate species that differ in mass by as little as 0.001 atomic mass unit; and 3) Mass Spectrometry Imaging is label free, provides untargeted analysis of thousands of molecular species simultaneously, offers extremely low limits of detection, and provides spatial mapping. The capability of this instrument will allow the project team to fill knowledge gaps and tackle pressing challenges in a wide range of scientific fields: environmental monitoring and remediation, biological, chemical, biochemical, and biomedical sciences. Access to this instrument will strengthen research at three Institutions and the Wadsworth Center at the Capital Region of New York and beyond. Besides benefiting the society through new discoveries and deep scientific endeavors, this instrument will be used for educating and training undergraduate and graduate students and outreach to the general public, and K-12 educators and students. \r\n\r\nThe proposed instrument will address critical challenges faced by at least ten researchers in multiple fields of research. This is enabled by the instrument\u2019s revolutionary capabilities in visualizing molecules in chemically complex microenvironments and providing quantitative compositional and structural analyses. These capabilities will bring game-changing discoveries in research related to oral microbial community, dental biofilm, fungal metabolome and proteome, RNA modifications, and epitranscriptome. In environmental impact analysis and remediation, this instrument will be used to detect and quantify isomers of per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS) and perform targeted screening and non-target analysis of these compounds in different environmental matrices. In the field of glycomics, the full structural characterization of carbohydrates is a standing analytical need in the characterization of structure-function relationships as well as biomedical applications. The proposed equipment permits confident isomer differentiation and structure elucidation and provides a sensitive and rapid overview of glycan profiles for complex glycoprotein mixtures. With respect to the Drosophila -parasitoid wasp interaction, the immune response of the host fly to another insect, the infecting wasp is largely unknown. The acquired instrument would enable deep understanding of changes at protein levels and localizing the cellular immune response through MALDI imaging.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
