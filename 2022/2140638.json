 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) project renewal will enable Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico (PUPR) to continue supporting the needs of national security and an increasingly technological society. The main goals of the PUPR-SFS program are: 1) increase the number of qualified students pursuing cybersecurity; 2) increase the involvement of underrepresented and minority faculty in students; 3) engage students in professional activities such as internships, development of workshops, and other outreach activities that provide synergistic interactions through various activities in cybersecurity. This project will directly impact twenty-eight (20 undergraduate, 6 Master, and 2 Ph.D.) students and broaden opportunities that enable talented Hispanic women and students from other underrepresented groups to enter academic programs in Computer Science and Engineering in Cybersecurity; helping to alleviate the nationwide shortage of qualified professionals in these areas. \r\n\r\nThrough its support for undergraduate and graduate students this PUPR-SFS project will increase research findings and improve education in multiple technology areas relevant to cybersecurity. PUPR is already involved in critical research in the areas of Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence such as Machine Learning; IoT Security; Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET); Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV); Computer and Network Security; E-Discovery and Digital Evidence; Computer Forensics; Social Engineering; Intrusion Detection; Cryptography; Cryptanalysis; Steganography; and Visualization Tools; among others. The project will help increase the knowledge base in security topics that are of national concern. Another goal is to engage students in professional activities such as internships, workshop development, and other outreach activities that provide synergistic interactions through various activities in cybersecurity. These activities will also include initiatives within the university that will enrich students' academic experiences, such as job fairs, symposiums, \"Capture the Flag\" competitions, and attendance at international refereed conferences. The project team will meet periodically with students to monitor progress in courses, research, and any other educational activities required of students. Expected outcomes will be evaluated periodically using a Program Evaluation Plan consisting of internal and external evaluations (with an experienced external evaluator). The plan assures that formative and summative evaluations are consistent with the program's expected outcomes, and, if required, corrective actions are taken in a timely manner.   \r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. Following graduation, scholarship recipients are required to work in cybersecurity for a federal, state, local, or tribal Government organization for the same duration as their scholarship support.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
