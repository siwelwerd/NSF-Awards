 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the importance for human development of childhood experiences with the natural world, little research has focused on young children's emotional encounters with nature or how these experiences shape their values, perceptions, and behaviors.  This research will systematically examine children's behavioral and emotional reactions to nature over a five-year period. The project will examine how family, culture, and geographical locations shape the manner in which children form their identity in nature.  The project will enhance understanding of how children learn to regulate their emotions in nature,  and  it will expand knowledge about the role education plays in shaping how children develop empathy and care for living and non-living aspects of their natural environments. The project will highlight the voices and perspectives of young Alaska Native and non-Native children living in Alaska, thereby, broadening participation in socio-ecological science in Polar Regions. The approaches used in this project offer a framework for participatory and naturalistic developmental research involving young children. Videos of the nature tours will be transformed into video lessons that will be shared with the public as a means of illustrating the role of culture in Alaska Native children's learning about, and interactions with, the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will enhance understanding of children's Environmental Identity Development by examining the following research questions: What informs Alaskan children's emotions and behaviors during outdoor wilderness experiences? How do children's experiences in the Alaska wilderness affect development over time? Research will occur in rural and non-rural Alaska during the spring and autumn seasons. The study will include children from a small isolated Alaskan village where the majority of families are of Alaska Native descent, and where access to consumer goods is limited. The study will also examine the experiences of non-Native children growing up in an Alaskan city. Because consumer goods are readily available in the city, these children may or may not learn hunting and gathering skills. This study will use a family survey to understand the different types of experiences that rural and non-rural Alaskan children have in the wilderness.  Children's drawings and descriptions of their drawings will be collected to learn about their favorite outdoor activities. Additionally, the study will use child-led nature tours. The tours will involve wearable cameras in order to examine children's experiences participating in outdoor activities with family members as well as their wilderness explorations with classmates. Data will be collected from rural and non-rural children at 4-5 years of age and again when they are 7-8 years old. In this way, the researcher will assess how children's emotional and behavioral interactions with nature develop through family and educational experiences over time.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Data included children&rsquo;s drawings and descriptions of their favorite outdoor activities and video collected from wearable cameras positioned on children&rsquo;s foreheads during class and family nature excursions. Footage from wearable cameras revealed how children see and experience their world, capturing their self-talk and expressions, and their micro-interactions in the environment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The study provided insight on the progressions of EID and its implications for education. Drawings revealed that<strong> </strong>4-5-year-old children favor many of the same activities, including playground play. However, the nature of <em>how </em>children interacted on the playground varied according to sociocultural and geographical features. For example, a child from a rural Alaskan village drew her playground, but she also drew herself holding a starfish at the nearby beach. Another child drew the playground, but also talked about playing in the mud with her boots and enjoying a pretty sunset. Others only included playground features, revealing limited access or limited interest in natural features.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Research found that a sense of <em>Trust in Nature &#8209; </em>feelings of comfort and security in nature - is foundation to healthy EID. Expressed emotions of fear or anxiety, or <em>Mistrust in Nature</em>, were more prevalent among children from non-rural Alaska and South Dakota. Some South Dakotan children expressed fear, disgust, and aversion towards bugs, while some Alaskan children expressed fear and anxiety towards certain environmental features (wobbly bridges, dark forests, and tall grass). For some, fear and discomfort, prompted feelings of <em>Environmental Shame &#8209;</em> a desire to avoid or leave the environment. Others used self-talk to negotiate environmental challenges, such as climbing a tree or navigating a prickly bush. Expressive utterances marked children&rsquo;s transition into imaginary play, for example, transforming a stick into a sword. A few older children engaged in nature play that emulated video game themes. At times, such play became a distraction from being present and aware, which is essential to the development of <em>Environmental Competency </em>- knowledge, skills, and ecological understandings. It is important to balance imaginary play experiences with those that attune children to observe and be aware of their surroundings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, children from rural Alaska demonstrated a more sophisticated level of confidence, skills, knowledge, and awareness of their environment than children from the non-rural sites. Several drew their favorite outdoor activity as &ldquo;playing out,&rdquo; referring to free play and exploration in the village and natural surroundings. At 4-5-years, these children knew where the wild peas grew at the beach, which berries were ripe to harvest, and how to fish for salmon. Make-believe play also demonstrated their <em>Environmental Competency</em>. For example, one child pretended a stick was a caribou antler and another pretended driftwood to be a bear paw. By relating natural objects to local fauna, these children demonstrated ecological awareness and empathy towards other living beings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Families from rural Alaska shared children&rsquo;s formative experiences fishing and harvesting berries on the tundra. Children portrayed important values such as sharing, shown through simple gestures like passing a feather to a friend, or harvesting berries for an elder. Acute observation is essential to early engagement in subsistence practices. This was demonstrated by a 4-year-old spotting a moose on a ridgeline over a mile away.

For example, some children attempted to break off sticks in the snow that were still part of a living tree, while others failed to recognize that running through a field was disturbing to migrating cranes. It is important for adults to actively teach children how to self-regulate their behaviors in relation to the flora and fauna of their places. Findings showed that children who demonstrated a more sophisticated level of <em>Spatial Autonomy</em> and <em>Environmental Competency</em> were more likely to engage in <em>Environmental Action</em> - care and stewardship of their environment.
