 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most everyone is familiar with telecommunication networks, networks that link our computers and mobile devices. What might be less known to the general public is that networks that make use of quantum features can offer tremendous advantages over their classical counterparts. Quantum networks, based on principles of quantum mechanics, allow for increased speed and security. Such networks, consisting of nodes and interconnecting channels, could revolutionize communication and computation, as well as provide a new means for modeling complex systems in physics and biology. The network\u2019s fixed nodes (quantum memory elements) can be implemented using matter in the form of trapped atoms that are able to store complex, quantum encoded messages for many seconds. Light can be used to connect the nodes, carrying quantum communication signals along optical fibers. The fundamental building block of a quantum telecommunication network is an interface between the fixed nodes (material quanta) and light (photons). To exploit the quantum properties of the network, it is necessary to couple the nodes in a uniquely quantum manner, referred to as quantum entanglement. This project will focus on demonstrating new capabilities for generation of such remote entanglement, to be used as a resource for distributed quantum information processing. A major goal of the project is to develop photonic interconnects for arrays and ensembles of trapped neutral atoms. Information will be processed and stored in the atoms and mapped onto propagating light fields coupled into optical fibers. Graduate and undergraduate student training and participation are primary educational goals of this project, providing opportunities for students at different career stages to collaborate with one another and faculty mentors, while learning techniques of experimental physics, optics, electronics, and computer-based data acquisition. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe research team will investigate quantum information processing using single photon states of light and trapped ultracold atoms. Strong interactions between highly excited states of the atoms (so-called Rydberg states) will serve as the basis for creating quantum gates between atomic qubits, while atom \u2013 single photon entanglement will be achieved using scattering of laser fields. This should allow for scalable generation and manipulation of complex entangled states involving both atomic qubits and single photons. Realization of this program will also lead to efficient distribution of entangled many-particle quantum states over long distances using optical fibers. The activity will contribute to the future implementations of long-distance quantum repeaters and distributed quantum computing. Efficient production of multi-qubit entangled states will impact fundamental physics investigations and advance quantum-enhanced measurement techniques. In doing so, this research will have a significant impact on advancing the progress of emerging technological applications of quantum computation and communication, quantum sensors for navigation and magnetometry, and atomic clocks. The research will involve both experimental and theoretical modeling components.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
