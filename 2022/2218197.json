 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite recent computational advancements, climate models still cannot explicitly resolve key physical processes like turbulence, convection, and clouds. These unresolved processes must be accounted for by parameterization schemes. The inability of these schemes to mimic reality has hindered the ability of model simulations to capture various observed phenomena, leading model biases and uncertainties. Recently, machine learning-based techniques have greatly improved these schemes. Nevertheless, the standard machine learning-based methods are built solely on idealized computational models without considering the wealth of observational data available. Thus, inherent inaccuracies of the parameterization schemes continue to undermine the performance of climate models. This project aims to improve machine-learning-based parameterization schemes and, thereby, enhance the performance of existing climate models. The proposer will incorporate observations and physical laws into machine learning techniques to make parameterization schemes more accurate and provide uncertainty estimates to capture the chaotic nature of the climate system. The proposed work will train a young postdoctoral scholar.\r\n \r\nSpecifically, the proposal will utilize data from satellite observations and high-resolution simulations to improve machine learning schemes. Physics-constraints will be imposed either through the incorporation of a physical loss term or by considering specific machine learning tools such as Neural Networks with fixed output layer that strongly imposes the known physical constraint. Uncertainty quantification in machine learning schemes will be implemented using ensemble learning or Bayesian approaches such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling schemes. The knowledge gained in this project could have an impact across climate science, including the advancement of global climate models\u2019 development and of machine learning application to Big Data in climate science, as well as the development of novel computational probabilistic methods for complex multi-scale and multi-physics real-world systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Given the available computational resources, small-scale processes are typically not resolved in those models but are rather represented by parameterization schemes. Machine learning has been recently used to improve existing parameterization approaches, yet those methods still show some important mismatches that are often attributed to stochasticity in the considered processes. This stochasticity can be due to noisy and sparse data, unresolved physical variables, or simply to the inherent chaotic nature of the process. In this project, we developed different probabilistic machine learning-based parameterization schemes for turbulence and atmospheric convection in order to improve generalization beyond training data and provide reliable uncertainty quantification.&nbsp;<br /><br />More specifically, we developed stochastic physics-constrained Machine Learning-based parameterization schemes that generalize beyond classic purely data-based Machine Learning methods by enforcing the final model to satisfy known physical laws. The framework was successfully tested for Lorenz &rsquo;96 model and quasi-geostrophic turbulent flow system (see Figure 1). The results show the capability of the probabilistic parameterization scheme to produce accurate temporal forecasts for the resolved variables while returning trustworthy uncertainty quantification for different sources of error.<br /><br />Furthermore, Machine Learning approaches still suffer from a lack of generalization and extrapolation beyond the training data regime, which is however critical to projecting climate change or unobserved regimes of turbulence. To overcome this major limitation, we proposed a multi-fidelity approach, which by integrating datasets of different accuracy and abundance, provides the best of both worlds: the capacity to extrapolate leveraging the physically-based parameterization and a higher accuracy using the machine-learning-based parameterizations. The stochastic multi-fidelity approach was successfully applied to atmospheric convection parameterization of full-blown Global Climate Models. In addition, the multi-fidelity scheme was tested on climate models different from the one used to generate the training dataset. The results highlight the generalization capabilities of the framework and its capacity to grasp the physical relation underlying the parameterization problem, rather than replicating the training dataset (see Figures 2, 3 and 4). Whereas existing machine learning-based climate parameterizations struggle to generalize beyond the training data regimes, we hope that thanks to the multi-fidelity extrapolation capabilities, the proposed approach will pave the way to finally tackle climate change projection with Artificial Intelligence.&nbsp;<br /><br />Besides, we contributed to the development of the benchmark datasets (1) ClimSim, the largest-ever dataset designed for hybrid Machine Learning-physics climate research based on multi-scale climate simulations and (2) ClimSim-Online which includes an end-to-end workflow for developing hybrid Machine Learning-physics simulators by allowing parameterization schemes to be coupled with climate models and tested online (see Figure 5). Both datasets are publicly available for free and ClimSim is considered as the most physically comprehensive dataset yet published for training Machine Learning emulators of atmospheric storms, clouds, turbulence, rainfall, and radiation for use in hybrid- Machine Learning climate simulation.&nbsp;<br /><br />In addition, we investigated the online testing of different machine-learning-based parameterization on full blown global climate models, including the multi-fidelity scheme, by stress-testing the coupled behavior of hybrid physics-machine learning climate simulations on an unseen, warmer climate. The results suggest there appears to be a weak relationship for prediction error between in-distribution and out-of-distribution climates and training on multiple simulated climates (similarly to the multi-fidelity framework mentioned above) is a necessity for generalization beyond observed training climates. Given the high variability of online results and the generally labor-intensive nature of performing online testing, investigating this possibility will require further collaboration between domain scientists and machine learning experts.<br /><br />Finally, in this project we also took part of the development of an online book &ldquo;Learning Machine Learning with Lorenz-96&rdquo; (submitted to JOSE journal). The book provides a comprehensive educational tool for students (and any person in general) who are keen to learn about the benefits, challenges, limitations and possibilities of using machine learning in the context of climate modeling and parameterization. Such a tool is free and publicly available.&nbsp;<br /><br />The knowledge gained in this project has an impact across the climate science spectrum, including advanced global climate models&rsquo; development, climate parameterization modeling, machine learning application to Big Data in climate science, and development of novel computational methods for complex multi-scale and multi-physics real-world systems.
