Its subject is the interplay between Poisson geometry and representation theory, and it is aimed primarily at early-career mathematicians. Its overarching goal is to expose the participants to a diverse spectrum of ideas on the forefront of modern research in these fields, and to give them an opportunity to enlarge their network of collaborators.\r\n\r\nThe meeting consists of a series of mini-courses given by senior mathematicians and contributed talks delivered by young researchers. These focus on the latest progress in several rapidly evolving areas at the intersection of Poisson geometry and representation theory, with an emphasis on Poisson manifolds of compact type, Poisson-Lie groups and quantum groups, and cluster structures in Poisson geometry. They are supplemented by structured discussion sessions, with the goal of promoting an active exchange of ideas and the formation of long-term working groups. Details of the schedule can be found on the conference website: https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/2629.html\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
