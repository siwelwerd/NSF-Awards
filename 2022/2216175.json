 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a state-of-the-art, high-resolution X-ray computed tomography instrument. This will enable a broad spectrum of research relying on accurate three-dimensional digitization and characterization of the internal structure of materials. Research projects utilizing this instrument involve novel additive manufactured materials critical for aerospace, automotive, defense and medical applications; cell structures and tissues used in immune system, tissue repair and bioengineering research; pharmaceutical materials; materials for energy applications including novel batteries and energy storage devices; as well as natural materials and organisms used in climate and earth sciences research. Similar to medical CAT Scans, X-ray computed tomography technology provides unprecedented capabilities for research, training, education, outreach and recruitment in STEM. It will promote regional and national collaborations with other universities and industry, while further enabling extensions to emerging technologies such as Industry 4.0. The instrument will be housed in and managed by the Materials Characterization Core, an established multiuser facility at Drexel University. This facility will be leveraged in recruiting events as well as outreach programs to increase the exposure of underrepresented minority students to cutting-edge research.\r\n\r\nThe proposed system offers: (a) submicron true spatial resolution and nanometer-sized voxels achieved by industry-leading dual stage magnification optics, (b) contrast enhancement enabled by detectors that are optimized to maximize data collection of contrast forming low energy X-ray photons, (c) the ability to evaluate larger specimens at high resolution using an associated extension and the included data-processing software, (d) an X-ray source with voltage and power output suitable for a wide range of materials, and (e) the ability to accommodate an array of in situ testing stages, including mechanical and thermal, without compromising performance. These capabilities that represent the state-of-the-art among all commercial systems available today, will enhance research on non-destructive evaluation, advanced material characterization and digitization of complex geometries. Specifically, there are four research foci that will be enhanced by this acquisition, including: 1) evaluation of the internal geometry at multiple length scales of a range of advanced materials; 2) enhanced property and behavior characterization of novel materials and devices via in situ testing; 3) data-driven computational material modeling assisted by data-processing and machine learning; and 4) digitization of flora and fauna, including delicate, rare and historic (150-year-old collections) specimens.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
