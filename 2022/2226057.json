 "awd_abstract_narration": "In today's data centers, network performance is surging, outstripping\r\nthe capacity of modern processors, and turning them into a performance\r\nbottleneck for demanding data center applications. Examples of\r\napplications suffering from this problem include the back end services\r\nimplementing Facebook, Google, Amazon, and other popular\r\nwebsites. These services spend most of their time conducting network\r\ninput/output. As the gap between processor and network performance widens,\r\nthese services become less and less efficient. More efficient server\r\nsoftware can ameliorate the situation, increasing the performance of\r\napplications while also reducing a data center's prodigious energy\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates a re-design of the server hardware and\r\nsoftware network stack, with the aim to streamline and improve network\r\nI/O energy-efficiency. To do so, the project utilizes a new\r\nprogramming model for energy-efficient packet processing in network\r\ncards, called match-and-action processing. The approach allows\r\napplications and operating systems to install packet processing rules\r\nto the network card that instruct it to execute simple operations on\r\npackets while transferring them to and from the host. This model is\r\nhighly energy efficient, yet allows to retain network protocol\r\nimplementation flexibility and compatibility with existing\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nThe work has the potential for dramatic improvements in application\r\nand server performance, as well as data center energy\r\nconsumption. Network intensive data center applications are used by\r\nbillions of people around the globe on a daily basis. By reducing the\r\noverhead of networking, the hardware needed to support existing\r\nservices can be reduced, making it cheaper for new services to be\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the space of design alternatives, the project builds a\r\nworking prototype and an emulator capable of running standard server\r\napplications. All source code, along with configuration files and\r\ninstructions for reproducing published measurements of the system,\r\nwill be made public and accessible from the project website at UT\r\nAustin (http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~simon/flexnic). The website will be\r\nactively maintained for the duration of the project.\r\n",
