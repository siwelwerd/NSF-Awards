 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the Cornell, Maryland, and MPI pre-doctoral Research School (CMMRS), a week-long summer school held at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in Saarbrucken, Germany, August 2922. For the fourth consecutive summer, the CMMRS will introduce world-class research to students (undergraduate and masters), and engage them, one-on-one and in small groups, with leading researchers in the field.\r\n\r\nThe 2022 CMMRS researchers span a wide range of areas, including computer systems, heterogeneous architectures, machine learning, data visualization, security and privacy, formal methods, and programming language design. The summer school exposes students, early in their careers, to the breadth and diversity of computer science (in particular computer systems) research, hopefully making them more likely to pursue doctoral degrees and eventually, careers in research. The support from this grant funds travel and accommodations for approximately 25 students from the United States to attend the summer school. In line with previous editions of CMMRS, special attention is given to recruit women and minority students to attend the School.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
