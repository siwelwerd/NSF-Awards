 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gordon Research Conference on Correlated Electron Systems provides an opportunity for scientists, especially graduate students and postdoctoral students, to learn and to be exposed to the latest developments in correlated electron materials. The biannual occurrence of these meetings is well-suited to the rapid pace of discovery in the physics of quantum and strongly correlated materials. The unique climate of Gordon Research Conferences, which encourage the presentation of unpublished, cutting-edge developments, while also promoting an informal, friendly atmosphere in which attendees, particularly students and postdocs, can gain ready access to world experts in the field, make this a very attractive meeting. Moreover, the low-cost accommodation at Mount Holyoke college, and the close vicinity of the meeting to institutions in the North-East and Mid-west, make this a meeting that is geographically and financially accessible to a large number of students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
