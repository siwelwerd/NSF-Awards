 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Board on Mathematical Sciences and Analytics (BMSA) and the Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics (CATS) within the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine provide a broad interface between the mathematical sciences research enterprise and federal agencies that rely on the mathematical and statistical sciences. BMSA and CATS explore science policy topics and create connections to mathematical and statistical foundations that inform policy makers. They provide objective and authoritative advice on how best to apply mathematical and  statistical tools and techniques to problems of national importance. These efforts strengthen federal policy making; identify promising research frontiers; catalyze and support impactful collaborations; and increase the visibility of, and appreciation for, the mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\nBMSA and CATS each consist of pro bono experts from a wide range of technical research areas and with experience in academia, industry, government, and national laboratories. These members carry out their work by identifying important opportunities for use of the mathematical sciences in federal policy making; recruiting diverse groups of experts to participate in workshops, studies, and other activities; and developing efforts to further increase the awareness of policy issues and solutions among the mathematical sciences communities. BMSA and CATS each meet quarterly to stay up to date on pressing issues and engage with stakeholders and members of the mathematical sciences communities\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
