 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by improving students' understanding of concepts in introductory physics. Introductory physics courses at large universities often serve hundreds of students every semester. One of the challenges in physics is that even with demonstrations and lab experiences, many concepts remain difficult for students to visualize. In addition, many instructors still rely on the lecture format instead of inquiry-based pedagogy, which more directly engages students. In this project, the investigators will develop multiple Augmented Reality (AR) simulations for general physics classes. Students will be able to manipulate these simulations of physical objects while holding in their hands a \"cube\" that acts as a controller for the simulations. The AR technology, which is relatively new in education, offers the promise of turning traditional lecture-style classrooms of 20 to 200+ students into dynamic learning environments, with students using only their smartphones and a \"printed-out\" cube. The investigators will explore the effects of the new simulations and the enhanced learning environment on students' understanding of the associated physics concepts.\r\n\r\nThe project team will develop six AR simulations covering key topics associated with forces, rotational motion, optics, circuits, thermodynamics, and magnetism. Along with the simulations, the team will develop video tutorials to help instructors use the tools in their classrooms. In particular, they will encourage instructors to incorporate the new tools using an Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) approach. Then they will attempt to determine what benefits, if any, are achieved, both for the students and for the instructors. The team will explore education research questions such as the following:\r\n(1) When AR simulations are incorporated into physics instruction, are they an effective tool to support instructors in adopting proven, research-based pedagogical strategies?\r\n(2) What are the effects of the simulations on students' conceptual understanding?\r\n(3) What are the effects of the simulations on students' achievement?\r\n(4) Are there specific aspects of AR that are beneficial to the physics students?\r\n(5) Do the AR experiences promote any additional interest in physics?\r\n(6) How do instructors perceive and use the simulations? (Do they find them useful for instruction? Do they perceive increased student interest in the content? Do they perceive increased student understanding of the material? What supports do instructors need for successful implementation? Will they continue to use the simulations?)\r\nThe NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
