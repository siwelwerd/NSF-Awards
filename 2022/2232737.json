 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will conduct a consensus study to provide guidance on future science research and technology directions needed to ensure continued U.S. science abilities and leadership in the Southern Ocean and Antarctic nearshore and coastal zone. The study will identify the highest-priority science directions for Southern Ocean and Antarctic nearshore and coastal research, determine research vessel capabilities needed to support these science directions, assess technologies and tools that can extend ship capabilities and/or directly support new science directions, and note gaps between the science directions, ship capabilities, and tools. The study will gather input from a broad and diverse group of oceanographers and coastal scientists, which will enhance community engagement and optimize the future use of Antarctic research vessels. \r\n\r\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will conduct a consensus study that identifies high-priority science research directions for Southern Ocean and Antarctic nearshore and coastal research, as well as the tools, technologies, and ship capabilities needed to ensure continued U.S. science abilities and leadership in the region. An ad hoc committee of carefully selected volunteers will provide disciplinary expertise and will gather information from a base of published literature, public meetings, and a workshop with invited scientific community members. This workshop is envisioned as a main information-gathering aspect to identify science directions and the ship and technological capabilities needed to support them. The committee members will deliberate on information provided throughout the information-gathering process and will produce a written report, which undergoes a rigorous peer review. The report is publicly released after approval from the National Academies and is available as a free pdf. This consensus study approach has previously been successfully used by federal agencies to obtain strategic guidance on research priorities and future needs, thereby enabling limited resources to be used most effectively.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This project identified the highest-priority science drivers for Southern Ocean and Antarctic coast, determined the needed capabilities for this research, and made recommendations to address gaps between science drivers and the current portfolio of capabilities.</p>\r\n<p>In order to complete this task, the National Academies constituted an ad hoc Committee on the Future Directions for Southern Ocean and Antarctic Nearshore and Coastal Research. As part of its deliberation, the committee held a community workshop on February 9&ndash;10, 2023. The workshop had 69 registered in-person attendees and 194 registered virtual attendees. Using the information gathered at the community workshop and from other sources, the committee identified three interdisciplinary scientific drivers&mdash;sea level rise, global heat and carbon budgets, and changing ecosystems. The committee also identified specific high-priority research questions within each science driver (Table S-1).</p>\r\n<p>The committee found that these science drivers justify major investments in the U.S. Antarctic Program. These investments include the replacement of aging research vessels and other enabling infrastructure, as well as the development and deployment of new technologies (e.g., vessels, aircraft, satellites, stations, tools) and partnerships (Figure 6-1). A top priority is the near-term construction of a Polar Class 3 Antarctic Research Vessel. Additional priorities include provision for small coastal vessel operations, development of innovative observation systems that can expand vessel capabilities, the expansion of shared instrument pools, upgrades to laboratories in Antarctic field stations, and support for national and international partnerships.</p>\r\n<p>To increase dissemination of the report, the National Academies organized a report release webinar and townhalls at the 2023 American Geophysical Union&rsquo;s Fall Meeting and the 2024 Ocean Sciences Meeting. These dissemination events provided a forum for the research community to learn about and discuss the findings of the report.
