 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2022, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment, and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Biofluorescence is a widespread light phenomenon where many organisms absorb and re-emit light at different wavelengths. The earliest investigations in to biofluorescence led to the discovery of the green fluorescence protein, GFP, from a jellyfish. This finding revolutionized biological science, leading to breakthroughs in marine, medical, and molecular sciences and ultimately resulting in a Nobel Prize. Further investigations into marine biofluorescence have led to discoveries of important functions in a number of organisms, and many of the discoveries from fluorescent research are being applied in medicine and biotechnology. Despite the importance of biofluorescence to the function and success of marine organisms, there are still many species where more research is needed to understand where, how, and why these organisms biofluoresce. This fellowship will investigate these questions while also providing a larger picture of the marine environment in which organisms that use biofluorescence live. \r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the proposed research are to identify the structure, pathway, and environmental distribution of the heterotrophic dinoflagellate, Gyrodinium jinhaense AP17, novel green fluorescent molecule(s). Specifically, this fellowship aims to (I) determine G. jinhaense AP17\u2019s fluorescent molecule\u2019s structure(s), (II) identify the chemical and molecular pathways behind the green fluorescence, and (III) investigate the environmental distribution of this green fluorescence in both local and global contexts. These aims will be achieved through the integration of analytical chemical techniques, experimental treatments, transcriptomics, gene silencing, analysis of metatranscriptomic data, and environmental sampling. The fellow will gain new scientific skills in analytical chemistry as well as improve and advance current research skills. Moreover, the projects will include undergraduate researchers and at least one workshop where public participants will be introduced to dinoflagellates by sampling and observing them, with other plankton, under the microscope. All findings will be published and shared broadly from elementary classrooms to scientific meetings and with media to inspire interest in biology, oceanography, conservation, and the scientific process.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
