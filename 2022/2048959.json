 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe unique FunsizePhysics website invites the science-curious public to experience some of the excitement of current scientific discovery in condensed matter physics as it unfolds.  The website offers cutting edge science written by the scientists themselves and strives to be welcoming with beautiful graphics and simple everyday language that relates to everyday experience.  Active researchers describe the wonder, beauty and potential of ground-breaking nanoscience on this website, in the belief that the science-curious public of any age should be able to explore and understand current scientific advances. The collection of current research by scientists makes their work broadly accessible. The description of fundamental concepts by leading researchers in their fields describes everyday concepts and techniques that are basic to research in condensed matter science. Activities that can be performed at home relate back to both current research and to basic concepts and techniques. This project implements strategies that will advance the goal of explosive growth for this website, using existing resources to speed the rate of new contributions and expand the social media presence of Funsize Physics. The ability to draw a larger audience ensures a bigger reach and broader impacts on a larger proportion of the population, to fulfill the goals of science literacy, public engagement, and broadening participation in STEM education.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nFunsizephysics.com serves as a repository for the ground-breaking research of the condensed matter physics community, with visually appealing, relatable, and evocative descriptions of the community's  research and activities and serves an important mission of \"promoting the progress of science\".  This proposal outlines strategies that will advance the goal of explosive growth for this website, using existing resources to speed the rate of new contributions and expand the social media presence of Funsize Physics. The project will increase engagement with traditionally underrepresented groups, both as contributors and as users, by collaborating with underrepresented minority institutions and by posting Spanish language translations of our posts. The Intellectual Merit of this proposal lies in the analysis of best practices for communicating to a broad audience of interested and curious non-scientists. The use of detailed statistics gathered on the website provide an extensive data set on posts, media platforms, and point of entry into the website. Analysis of these data sets aims to strengthen strategies to engage the public and provide both the impetus and the confidence for scientists to reach out. The Broader Impact of the Funsize Physics project is dedicated to disseminating current research results and successful physics-based activities from the condensed matter community to a broad audience.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
