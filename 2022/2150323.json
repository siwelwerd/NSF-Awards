 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI Program), this Implementation and Evaluation Project aims to build a sustainable, inclusive learning community for HSI Computer Science (CS) students through a peer mentoring program to enhance the quality of CS education and to increase the retention and graduation rates of students in CS, particularly Hispanic students. CS suffers from several disparities along racial and gender lines that limit the participation of students in a field that is becoming more critical for their future career paths and for society as a whole. The project team has identified two reasons leading to this problem that will addressed in this project. First, there is a critical shortage of educational resources for our undergraduate students in the first CS course. Many students struggle with the introductory curriculum and existing resources don't appear to be sufficient, particularly for underrepresented groups. Second, students, especially underrepresented students, are not affirmed in their CS identities and sense of belonging. This project will implement a peer mentor program to develop an effective, evidence-based, and sustainable program for the preparation, tutoring, and ongoing support of undergraduate students in the CS department at SFSU and evaluate its effectiveness. By recruiting diverse peer mentors, training them in equitable and inclusive pedagogical techniques, and establishing an affirming mentoring procedure, this project will develop mentors themselves to become future leaders while creating a safe and inclusive learning community for entry level CS students. This program will directly benefit approximately 800 CS students at SFSU, including 750 students who are enrolled in the introductory CS class and 50 peer mentors each calendar year.\r\n\r\nBy building an inclusive, sustainable community of learners that affirms the experiences and identities of underrepresented students, the project will help diversify the CS pipeline, leading to a wider range of ideas and approaches that can be brought to bear on society\u2019s most pressing problems. Research will support programmatic activities as well as contributing new knowledge important to addressing the needs of CS students from marginalized groups. The team will explore three research questions: (1) to what extent does participation in peer mentoring affect mentees\u2019 sense of belonging, CS identity, and retention in the field? (2) to what extent does participation in an inclusive pedagogy class support peer mentors in developing a growth mindset and asset-based thinking, identifying the need for inclusive teaching practices, and implementing such practices? (3) what are the benefits to peer mentors in participation in the program, including their sense of belonging and CS identity? Assessment will use a mixed-methods approach, triangulating the results of Likert-scale surveys, open-ended surveys, semi-structured interviews, course artifacts and grade distributions. It is anticipated that mentees\u2019 and mentors' sense of belonging, CS identity, and program retention will increase. Results will be disseminated through CS and STEM education conferences and publications and the CSU Chancellor's office. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
