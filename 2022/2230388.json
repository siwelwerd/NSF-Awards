 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project serves the national interest by providing undergraduate and graduate students in the mathematical sciences with \u201cinsider\u201d knowledge that will allow them to make informed decisions about their educational and career choices. Specifically, this project will support the third offering of the Online Undergraduate Resource Fair for the Advancement and Alliance of Marginalized Mathematicians, a two-day online conference.  Building from two prior offerings in 2020 and 2021 that involved 350 and 400 participants, respectively, the 2022 conference will include six main activities for participating students: (1) Our Stories talks, where recent PhD recipients will share their experiences; (2) crash courses that provide brief overviews of fields of mathematics common in undergraduate research; (3) a summer opportunities panel; (4) a student experiences panel; (5) two plenary presentations; and (6) two virtual networking lunches.  \r\n\r\nToo often, students can be excluded from educational and career opportunities simply because they are not \u201cin the know\u201d, be that due to insufficient mentorship, underdeveloped institutional advising systems, or other circumstances. This is a particularly common challenge for individuals from low-income backgrounds, first-generation students, and students from populations that have historically been underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. This conference looks to provide important mentoring and networking opportunities to promote positive and inclusive access to opportunities for all students.  The conference builds upon three pillars: (1) sharing information about resources and opportunities through conference presentations and panel discussions; (2) providing access to role models and representation through a careful selection of speakers with diverse identities and experiences and a history of supporting students; and (3) providing access to networking opportunities. A participant overview and an assessment of the conference\u2019s effectiveness will be conducted using a registration form, a Zoom meeting report, a post-conference survey immediately after the conference, and a post-conference survey four months after the conference. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Lastly, there were also those who attended but did not register by means of a shared link from a friend.

The biographical resources utilized for the speaker selection include Mathematically Gifted and Black, The 500 Queer Scientists Project, The Spectra Outlist, Lathisms, Indigenous Mathematicians, The Math Alliance&rsquo;s mentor list, Mathematicians of the African Diaspora, and the AMS Living Proof Blog.
