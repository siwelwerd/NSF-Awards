 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on scoliosis physiotherepy. Physiotherapy Scoliosis Specific Exercises (PSSEs) have been proved effective in treating scoliosis patients; However, PSSE effectiveness can be significantly reduced due to inappropriate planning, unclear requirements, and poor compliance. This project seeks to develop a hardware-software integrated system which employs a synthetic, immersive environment for physiotherapists and patients to conduct PSSEs effectively. The technology may save costs for patients, expand services for clinics, and improve the outcomes of scoliosis physiotherapy. The commercialization of the technology will be conducted via business to business and business to customer mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the development a hardware-software integrated system which employs a patient digital twin (PDT) and a performance capture system to create a synthetic, immersive environment for physiotherapists and patients to utilize telehealth communication between physiotherapists and scoliosis patients.  The technology seeks to improve the accuracy and completeness of diagnosis and assessment, optimize physiotherapy design and planning, facilitate effective patient communication and education, and help patients to perform physiotherapeutic exercises according to instructions and compliance requirements. By using PDT, the diagnosis of scoliosis and assessment of spine deformity can be performed in 3D space thus improving the completeness of assessment and the design of PSSEs. By building a light-weight performance capture system, body shape, pose, and motion can be captured in 3D space in real time. The teams seeks to represent the prescribed PSSEs in 3D games by animating the PDT with motion captured during clinic practice. In this way, the actual poses and motions of a patient during home exercise can be monitored, evaluated, and used to instruct with adjusted 3D games as reference. The goal of Phase I is to demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed innovation, which will be accomplished through a technical feasibility study, initial prototyping, and a commercial feasibility demonstration.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Physiotherapy Scoliosis Specific Exercises (PSSEs) have been proved effective for treating scoliosis patients with mild and moderate curves and beneficial for patients in bracing with moderate to severe curves and in post-surgery rehabilitation. However, due to the limitations in PSSE design, instruction, and practice at home, the effectiveness of PSSEs can be severely diminished. Therefore, Innovision proposed to develop a hardware-software integrated system, Ufit-Exercise, which provides an immersive, instructive, and interactive environment for physiotherapists (PTs) and Scoliosis patients to conduct PSSEs effectively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In Phase I, Innovision team has conducted a series of research activities, which include performance capture system construction, patient digital twin creation, PSSE design and modeling, performance monitoring and evaluation, software development, and test and evaluation. The outcomes of Phase I work are described as follows.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Two performance capture systems have been built. &nbsp;One is based on RealSense<sup>TM</sup>, and the other is based on Azure Kinect<sup>TM</sup>. Both systems, supported by software developed in Phase I, can be used to capture body motion and back surface deformation and to conduct back surface deformation analysis. </li>\n<li>The protocol, algorithm, and codes have been developed to create Scoliosis patient digital twin. The PDT provides unified, three dimensional, and dynamic information of body shape and muscular skeleton, which are useful to Scoliosis assessment, exercise design and training, patient education, PSSE modeling and monitoring, and treatment progress tracking. </li>\n<li>3D games have been created to replicate PSSEs from 2D videos to provide references for PSSE design and training. The full body muscle model has been created with detailed description of intrinsic and extrinsic muscle groups relevant to Scoliosis physiotherapy, which provides an effective tool for a PT to explain the cause-effect of muscle activation. </li>\n<li>A streamlined process has been established to use the motion data captured from a patient to animate the PDT, which in turn is used as the reference for the patient?s home exercises. A two-step procedure has been developed to monitor and evaluate patient?s motion and back surface deformation, so as to help a patient to improve exercise compliance. </li>\n<li>An initial prototype of Ufit-Exercise software system has been constructed as a SaaS, with the frontal end for users? services and back end for core technologies integration and tasks handling.
