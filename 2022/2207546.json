 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in fundamental physics, where discoveries are likely to shape future technologies. This is similar to the early 20th century formulation of quantum mechanics now forming the foundation of microelectronics and quantum technologies. There are overwhelming indications that the current state of physics knowledge is incomplete: in particular, modern physics and cosmology fail to describe the nature of 85% of matter in the universe. There are internal consistencies both in the very foundation of modern physics, the Standard Model, and in formulating viable theories of quantum gravity. The field is ripe for major discoveries. Here the PI pursues a low-cost strategy that extends the discovery reach further by analyzing novel high-rate data from the Global Positioning System (GPS), contributing to the improved diagnostics of this important national resource. Another practical aspect is the development of high-accuracy computational tools useful in benchmarking the less-accurate toolbox of relativistic quantum chemistry of heavy elements. Such developments are relevant to nuclear energy production and nuclear waste management and, by extension, to strengthening national energy security.\r\n\r\nThe project has two major components: (i) Next-generation ab initio relativistic many-body calculations of atomic parity violation. The goal is to improve the internal consistency of earlier work and to reduce theoretical uncertainty. Attaining this goal will result in an improved low-energy test of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model of elementary particles. (ii) Search for bursts of low-mass exotic fields emitted by cataclysmic astrophysical events, such as black hole mergers. This is a novel, exotic physics modality in multi-messenger astronomy. The search is carried out by analyzing atomic clock data from GPS satellites. The outcome is either a discovery of the predicted multi-messenger signature or an improvement of the current constraints on coupling of atomic clocks to plausibly emitted exotic fields by several orders of magnitude. The project may yield the first experimental signature of quantum gravity.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
