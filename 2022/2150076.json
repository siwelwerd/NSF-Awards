 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal REU site will provide research experiences for ten undergraduate students per year at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. A cohort of students including those from institutions with limited research opportunities will be recruited to increase access to high-quality research opportunities and mentors in engineering. Students will work in laboratories tackling projects in various aspects of bioengineering. They will engage in a \u201cBoot Camp\u201d-style training for foundational technical skills and pursue professional development opportunities. Students will contribute to broadening awareness of bioengineering by developing \u201cStories in Bioengineering\u201d and hands-on activities. The integrated experience will not only guide a cohort of undergraduate students through a research project, but will also raise their social awareness and capacity to see broad options for engineering careers.\r\n\r\nTo develop a globally engaged engineering workforce encompassing Americans of all backgrounds, we must engage students at early stages of their educational careers who might not otherwise have a research opportunity. For this REU site renewal, participants will perform research in bioengineering. The objectives of the proposed project are to: 1) engage thirty undergraduate students from many populations in bioengineering research wherein they are guided towards independence in solving open-ended problems, 2) aid students in developing their societal awareness in engineering design and their professional skills and confidence, and 3) facilitate high-quality mentored experiences between the REU participants, faculty advisors, and graduate student mentors that extends beyond the duration of the REU program. Students will begin with a bioengineering techniques training \u201cBoot Camp\u201d, followed by weekly workshops addressing research, communication, ethics, mentoring, and graduate school as well as socially directed engineering design and innovation will help the students\u2019 gain professional skills and personal confidence, critical for the students\u2019 success in research. The REU participants will develop \u201cStories in Bioengineering\u201d videos and hands-on activities with broad public dissemination.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
