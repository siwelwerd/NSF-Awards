 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Ornithological Congress (IOC) is arguably the world\u2019s most important gathering of avian scientists. This conference occurs every four years, and it serves as a milestone within the discipline of ornithology. The next IOC will take place August 14-20, 2022 in Durban, South Africa. A key tradition at the IOC is supporting student participation and nurturing the next generation of scientists. This award will provide financial assistance for students in the United States to attend the IOC by helping them pay for travel and lodging associated with the meeting. Funds will also be used to encourage participation of groups that are underrepresented in science fields, including Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, Native Pacific Islanders, people with disabilities, veterans, and first-generation college students. Moreover, the award selection committee will seek out students from institutions and research labs where funding for student travel is scant or unavailable. The 2022 IOC will not only expose students to cutting-edge research from all over the world, but will also provide key opportunities for personal and professional development. Conferences are where students learn the broader rules of conduct for their field, and they help students internalize their professional identities. Moreover, the IOC will provide many opportunities for students to showcase their research and contribute to the scientific record through live presentations, scientific posters, and video-recorded talks. Student participation in conferences like the IOC is critical for perpetuating a vibrant scientific community, and the 2022 IOC is poised to play a pivotal role in the careers of its student attendees. \r\n\r\nSupport for student travel to the 2022 International Ornithological Congress (IOC) will be administered by an international panel of experts who will review and rank all student applications. In addition to NSF funds, this panel will oversee distribution of contributions from other sources of student support; however, all NSF funds will be earmarked for US students. Students will apply for travel support as part of the registration process, and the selection committee will distribute funds in a manner that encourages participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields as well as students who may lack financial support from their labs or academic departments. Student attendees at the 2022 IOC will benefit from a scientific program that is rich in interdisciplinary research as well as several special events that promote student research and professional development. The scientific program is organized around 45 topical symposia as well as several open sessions for oral presentations. Students may contribute to symposia or open sessions, and they may also present posters and 5-minute \u2018speed talks.\u2019 As part of a new IOC format, all contributions to the scientific program will require submission of a pre-recorded video presentation. These videos will be compiled into digital proceedings that will be published online, complete with citation guidelines and digital object identifiers. Hence, among the many benefits to student participants at the 2022 IOC, there is a straightforward means to contribute to the scientific record. Although, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has warranted extreme caution in the planning of the 2022 IOC (as well as a backup plan to go online), the in-person scientific dialog afforded by attendance at the 2022 IOC will be a vital component in the education of young scientists.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
