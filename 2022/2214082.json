 "awd_abstract_narration": "For many agricultural households, labor migration has emerged as a popular strategy to mitigate and overcome the stresses and threats to their livelihood. While migration as a livelihood diversification strategy can be an effective response to economic precarity, labor migration and remittance is usually a temporary measure. Upon returning home, they not only have to find alternative sources of livelihood but assimilate to new local realities and cultural patterns. This project builds a framework to understand the types of livelihood capital available to migrants once they return home, and how this capital interacts with community standards of success circulating in their respective social networks. It responds to community needs and was initiated at the local level, by community stakeholders. However, as return migration is a global issue, this project incorporates a research approach to make its findings generalizable and can be expanded to examine return migration and reintegration in other contexts for cross-cultural comparisons. Findings have the potential to inform policy, along with the design and implementation of reintegration support programs for returnees. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to obtain an understanding of success as defined by the local community and assess how non-migrants and migrant returnees align with these local definitions, through successive free-listing, semi-structured interviews, and cultural consonance. It will then identify livelihood outcomes among non-migrants and migrant returnees and collect information on sustainable livelihood capitals that individuals have acquired through their respective networks using a life history calendar and semi-structured interviews to guide network data collection. Combining qualitative methods and data with quantitative network measures will contribute to methodological discussions of network analysis, specifically ego networks, within anthropology. The project brings new insights into the discipline by adding a layered and interdisciplinary approach to anthropological theories at the intersection of culture, migration, and network studies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

Individuals from traditionally agricultural households and lower socioeconomic standings often end up quitting school at the elementary levels, with very few making it to seventh through tenth grade. This is often due to financial constraints - they are unable to pay the school fees, afford school books and uniforms, transportation, or parents need them to help out with the farm.

Individuals initially travel abroad because they feel that this is their only path to success and they have no other options in terms of being able to support their family and sustain a livelihood in Nepal. After experiencing work abroad, whether it is just a few months, or several decades, transnational migrants return to Nepal with the hope of creating some sort of livelihood strategy in their own home country, alongside their family, so that they can remain there and not have to work abroad again.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Very few of these returnees are able to accomplish all of their livelihood goals upon returning home. Most migrants and returnees often end up taking out additional loans to supplement any financial capital they bring back from working abroad in order to build a cemented house. In terms of livelihood outcomes upon returning, most individuals end up working at home doing subsistance agricultural once again, along with occasional labor work such as building houses. Those that have returned with some financial capital attempt to start some sort of small business such as raising chickens (meat and eggs), goats (meat), buffalos (milk), or pigs (meat) to sell.&nbsp; Only a small minority of returnees are actually able to translate the skills and job experiences they acquired abroad back in Nepal.&nbsp; The exceptions are migrants that worked jobs requiring drivers while abroad, such as furniture or food deliveries. These returnees end up purchasing a public bus or other transportation vehicle and attempt to sustain their livelihood as drivers in Nepal.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>The culture of migration in Nepal and its impact on the local economy is resounding. It was much more difficult to identify individuals that had never been abroad to work, operationalized as non-migrants. With the exception of a handful, many of these non-migrants were non-migrants not by choice - either they were unable to go abroad due to medical issues, or they had already crossed the age limit. These individuals, if given the option to go abroad, would choose this over staying in Nepal. Non-migrants that remained in Nepal by choice were individuals that came from households with higher SES, had completed at least the 10th grade, had successfully joined either the Nepal or Indian Army or Police, or had been able to secure some sort of government or white-collar job such as working at a bank or financial cooperation. Even so, most individuals had attempted to go abroad at least once in their life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In conclusion, preliminary findings show that individuals from traditionally agricultural households with lower SES see working abroad as one of their only pathways to \"success\" because of limited job opportunities available in Nepal. Once they have concluded their period working abroad, they return to Nepal with hopes of building an ongoing source of income in Nepal but often struggle to provide for their families with the livelihood strategies and ventures they end up pursuing when back at home. The Nepali government also currently does not have policies in place specifically to support returnees in their attempts to reintegrate back home. Ultimately, returnees resort to traveling abroad once more, or, if they are ineligible due to their age or medical issues, they resort to sending their child abroad in their stead.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/28/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alisha&nbsp;Giri</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2214082/2214082_10799420_1690649608124_PoultryFarmManager--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2214082/2214082_10799420_1690649608124_PoultryFarmManager--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Poultry Farm Manager\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2214082/2214082_10799420_1690649608124_PoultryFarmManager--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Poultry Farm Manager\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Migrant returnee and manager of the poultry farm working with local villagers to oversee packaging of eggs to be sold to nearby vendors and stores.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anuupa Thapa</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alisha&nbsp;Giri</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Poultry Farm Manager</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2214082/2214082_10799420_1690649458146_GoatFarm2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2214082/2214082_10799420_1690649458146_GoatFarm2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Goat Farm\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2214082/2214082_10799420_1690649458146_GoatFarm2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Goat Farm\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Goats being fed at a village goat farm owned and managed by a migrant returnee and his non-migrant younger brother.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anuupa Thapa</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alisha&nbsp;Giri</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Goat Farm</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2214082/2214082_10799420_1690649352513_GoatFarmOwner--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2214082/2214082_10799420_1690649352513_GoatFarmOwner--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Migrant Returnee Goat Farmer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2214082/2214082_10799420_1690649352513_GoatFarmOwner--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Migrant Returnee Goat Farmer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Migrant returnee currently in year three of starting a goat farm with his younger brother.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anuupa Thapa</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alisha&nbsp;Giri</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Migrant Returnee Goat Farmer</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2214082/2214082_10799420_1690649692361_EggsproducedatPoultryFarm--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2214082/2214082_10799420_1690649692361_EggsproducedatPoultryFarm--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Eggs produced at local poultry farm.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2214082/2214082_10799420_1690649692361_EggsproducedatPoultryFarm--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Eggs produced at local poultry farm.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Eggs packaged and ready to be distributed to local vendors and realtors.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Anuupa Thapa</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Alisha&nbsp;Giri</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Eggs produced at local poultry farm.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
