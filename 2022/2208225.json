 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 19th annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference, to be held April 1-3, 2022, at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. It is a conference for graduate students interested in topology and geometry. The presentations will be given by graduate student participants with additional lectures from plenary and early-career faculty speakers. Participants will represent a diverse range of institutions and geographic regions. This will be the an opportunity for the participants to network and speak with experts in their field whether in-person or in the online format. This is one of the few conferences in topology and geometry that is dedicated to graduate students. Geometry and topology are fundamental mathematical fields with deep connections to many other areas of research, such as dynamics, physics, computer science, and mathematical biology. The conference enables graduate students at all years of their study to engage in and communicate current research in geometry and topology while in a safe and welcoming environment.   \r\n  \r\nTalks will range in various subfields of topology and geometry including the following: equivariant homotopy theory, contact and symplectic topology, Heegaard Floer homology, Khovanov homology, 4 manifold topology, Riemannian geometry, hyperbolic geometry, mapping class groups, and quantum topology. Plenary speakers include Bruce Kleiner (Courant Institute, geometric topology), Kirsten Wickelgren (Duke University, homotopy theory and arithmetic geometry), and Ian Zemke (Princeton University, symplectic geometry). Early career faculty speakers include Roger Casals (UC Davis, contact geometry), Tyrone Ghaswala (UQAM, mapping class groups), Christy Hazel (UCLA, equivariant homotopy theory), Aaron Mazel-Gee (CalTech, factorization homology), Maggie Miller (Stanford, low dimensional topology), and Jiayin Pan (Fields Institute, global Riemannian geometry). The conference website is https://gstgc22.math.gatech.edu/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
