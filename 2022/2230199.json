The workshop will be hosted at the Ohio State University on June 27-28, 2022. This Project Scoping Workshop will provide a forum for the U.S. Quantum Information, Science, Engineering, and Technology (QISET) community to take stock of recent scientific advancements, identify current challenges, discuss opportunities to overcome those challenges, and map a way forward for Accelerating Progress Towards Practical Quantum Advantage. The workshop participants will discuss opportunities for goal-oriented, use-inspired translational research that brings together a convergence of the physical sciences, engineering, technology, computer science, and software engineering. If successful, such activities will give rise to new industries and must engage all Americans \u2013 regardless of background or location \u2013 and lead to new career opportunities in QISET. This project advances the goals of the National Quantum Initiative Act.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
