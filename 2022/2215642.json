 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Berry College is acquiring a bio-layer interferometry (BLI) spectrometer to support the research of Professor Dominic Qualley and colleagues Angela Poole, Alice Suroviec, and Mark Turlington. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of macromolecular binding kinetics and real-time biomolecular interactions. BLI is an optical method that measures interference patterns of white light that are reflected from a surface coated in biomolecules to reveal real-time binding interactions. As a result, macromolecular interactions, affinity, and kinetics can be quantified. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students in many departments as well as provides accessibility for local middle and high school students. Research and research training in the areas of biotechnology and sustainability are targeted. The instrument is also leveraged in upper division laboratory undergraduate courses and in outreach activities for middle and high school students.\r\n\r\nThe award of the BLI spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as protein structure and function, bioanalytical and medicinal chemistry, and functional biology. Research focuses on understanding the structure and function of proteins involved in viral assembly. In addition, kinetics studies are performed for characterizing the bovine leukemia virus RNA packaging processes and the assembly mechanics of the West Nile virus as well as for elucidating parameters that are effective proteolysis targeting chimeras. It also assists with exploring protein-protein interactions for biosensor development and for investigating interactions associated with reproductive technologies in animal systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
