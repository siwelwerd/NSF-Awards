 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geological field expeditions in polar regions are logistically difficult, financially expensive, and can have a significant environmental impact on pristine regions. The scarcity of exposed rock outcrop in Antarctica, which is 98% ice-covered, makes previously collected rock samples very valuable to the science community in disciplines like long term climate change, planetary science, paleontology, geology, marine science, and more. The U.S. Polar Rock Repository was established at the Ohio State University in 2003 to meet the need for preserving rock, dredge, and terrestrial core samples from polar areas. The Polar Rock Repository seeks out, accepts, and curates geological samples collected primarily from Antarctica and the southern oceans. The existence of the Polar Rock Repository allows samples collected at a high financial cost to be used to their full scientific potential. Currently more than 55,000 samples are available as no-cost loans for research, education, and museum exhibits. In addition to the physical samples, the repository archives supporting materials from the collector, such as images of the samples, field maps, air photos, thin sections, and any associated bibliography/Digital Object Identifiers. Scientists, graduate students, and undergraduate students routinely use samples from the Polar Rock Repository for their research projects. The Polar Rock Repository also freely loans an educational 'rock box' that contains representative rock, fossil and mineral samples, books and activities about geology and Antarctica to pre-college teachers from across the United States.  The Polar Rock Repository recently developed a \u201cvirtual rock box\u201d to allow similar activities to occur outside of the classroom.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Polar Rock Repository (PRR) provides stewardship of polar rock sample collections and metadata. It is one of the few lending rock repositories to allow destructive research techniques to be used on samples. The PRR website and in-house digital metadata archive provides for global dissemination of data and a unique resource for pilot studies, proposal preparation and field logistics planning. The PRR provides free, full and open access to metadata and collections. Over the course of this award, the PRR will work proactively with the research community to acquire scientifically valuable rock collections and supplementary materials that will enhance the PRR collection. Samples will be cataloged following standard curatorial practices and will be made discoverable through the public facing portion of the Collections Management system developed at the Byrd Polar Climate and Research Center. The preservation of these physical samples, along with archiving of associated metadata, and inclusion of Digital Object Identifiers in a discoverable online database, allows for transparency and reproducibility in polar earth science research. The Collections Management System will continue to be updated and improved. The Curator will continue to advance the discoverability of the PRR by attending meetings, creating a webinar and contacting scientists about new collections at the facility. The PRR will continue to fulfill loans of samples and enhance the links with other repositories and data management entities to better enable interdisciplinary research. Educational outreach to pre-college schools will continue with the 'polar rock box' being freely available to schools with in the United States.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
