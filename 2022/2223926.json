 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genomic revolution has ushered in a new era of biological research. Genomes have been sequenced for not only humans and traditional laboratory animal models such as mice and fruit flies, but thousands of diverse organisms. However, to turn this data into a deep understanding of how genes function, scientists need the ability to manipulate these genes in the newly sequenced species. Recent years have seen dramatic technological improvements to genome editing in several of these species, enabling direct tests. An NSF-funded symposium at the Society for Integrative Biology (SICB) in Austin, TX in January 2023 will shine a spotlight on research in diverse species to reveal new principles of biological function. Work presented aims to accelerate development of these tools in additional species by gathering gene editing experts to teach their methods to others. Using tools like CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, speakers have modified the genomes of species from jellyfish to mammals and many species in between. Studying many of the unique model organisms represented at SICB may have broad impacts including transformative knowledge advances, an understanding of ecologically important species, or medical insights. This symposium will help democratize gene editing tools to many species and advance knowledge of fundamental biological principles. \r\n\r\nThe advent of genetic manipulations has enabled incredible insights into genetic mechanisms that control biological processes. However, it has also promoted the consolidation of research into a limited number of species (eg, fruit fly, mouse, zebrafish, C. elegans). As a result, the genetic regulation of a tremendous variety of evolutionary adaptations across species have been understudied at a mechanistic level. The development of CRISPR/Cas genome editing, in particular, enables an expansion of the number of species in which genetic experiments can be performed. Some progress has been made in using gene-edited species to understand organismal biology in ways inaccessible with traditional model organisms. The goal of this symposium is to catalyze the transfer of knowledge and skills from researchers who have applied these technologies in new model organisms to scientists who would like to bring these approaches to their own research programs. A symposium at the 2023 Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) conference, which will feature talks, discussions, and a workshop. The speakers (who span institution types, locations, genders, along a spectrum of career stages) have modified species from jellyfish to mammals and many species in between. There will also be an educational event in which speakers from the symposium provide small-group consultations plus a panel discussion. To disseminate this work, all speakers have agreed to publish data presented at SICB in Integrative and Comparative Biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
