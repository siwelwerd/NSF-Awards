 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support community and technical colleges and their faculty to submit proposals to, and maximize their benefit from, funding through the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Program. ATE grants increase faculty ability and institutional capacity to address the need for a skilled technical workforce. The persistent need for highly skilled technicians is recognized and well-documented, but educational programs have been upended by disrupters like COVID. Virtual instruction has become essential across all disciplines, and overall enrollments have declined, as have college budgets. Meanwhile, the critical and growing need for technicians in advanced technology industries remains. Although the ATE Program is uniquely positioned to help colleges address technician education challenges, colleges must develop and submit grant proposals to access this funding. For the ATE Program to impact two-year institutions of higher education (2-yr IHEs) and educate the skilled technical workers needed by industry, barriers to becoming an ATE grantee must be mitigated. Prior awards have made strides toward reducing barriers, engaging more two-year college technician educators, developing STEM faculty leaders, expanding mentoring capacity, and increasing impacts of the ATE Program. Even so, there are still many two-year colleges that have not yet benefited from the ATE Program.\r\n\r\nMentor-Connect Forward: Leadership Development and Outreach for ATE (M-C Forward) will: 1) advance technician education in new and proven ways by expanding engagement of geographically and demographically diverse 2-yr IHEs and STEM faculty with the ATE Program; 2) stimulate use of ATE-developed resources; 3) encourage and support the submission of proposals by new and previous grantee institutions; 4) develop leaders and mentors among those who receive ATE funding; and 5) support and guide new principal investigators (PIs) to help them become successful grantees. The project builds on successes and lessons learned from prior projects and leverages the work of other funded mentoring projects. Peer mentoring and technical assistance will leverage problem-based learning to engage college teams in sustainable, faculty-lead improvement of technician education courses and programs. ATE Program information and grant proposal instructions and development strategies will be provided via workshops, webinars, online resources, and a help desk. A Mentor Fellows internship program will build mentoring capacity in the ATE Program. An existing Resource Repository will be enhanced by a new intake, review, and user support system, and will benefit from contributions from other ATE-funded mentoring initiatives. New instructional resources and support to guide first-time PIs, PI 101, will promote leadership development, reduce the learning curve, support improved project outcomes, and encourage development of subsequent proposals. Mentor-Connect will be responsive to, and continuously improved by, rigorous evaluation of all project activities. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
