 "awd_abstract_narration": "University of Louisville (UL) is part of a multi-institution Industry University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) for Efficient Vehicles and Sustainable Transportation Systems (EVSTS) that supports the U.S. automotive industry\u2019s effort to meet demanding federal regulations governing vehicle fuel economy and emissions, and society\u2019s expectations for improved sustainability. Achieving environmental sustainability is a generational problem that represents one of the most critical technological challenge of our time. Electricity generation (31%) and transportation (27%) are the largest contributors to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Wheeled ground vehicles, in turn, generate most of the transportation emissions and have an increasing impact on emissions from electricity generation. Solutions must address vehicle sustainability without unduly disrupting an industry that is central to the nation\u2019s economic health and its citizens\u2019 lifestyles. The EVSTS Center engages the automotive industry\u2019s critical stakeholders - vehicle manufacturers, component and system suppliers, fleet operators, ground transportation infrastructure providers, and state / local governments - in yielding transformational improvements in the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability of ground vehicles. Scope of the work encompasses passenger cars, trucks, and motorized non-road equipment, as well as vehicle-level technologies and transportation system infrastructure, reflecting the complexity and global nature of the automotive and ground transportation industries.\r\n\r\nThe EVSTS center leverages collaborations among corporate, government, and academic partners to conduct and disseminate industry-relevant research on technologies and tools that facilitate the design, manufacture, deployment, and operation of energy efficient, environmentally sustainable ground vehicles. Research is conducted in five technical focus areas: 1) electrified vehicle powertrains, 2) conventional powertrains and alternative fuels, 3) non-powertrain vehicle systems optimization, 4) efficient / sustainable autonomous vehicles, and 5) transportation systems and infrastructure. Specifically, UL\u2019s site research focus is on realizing sustainable ground vehicles. Site-specific topic areas are include 1) advancement and modernizing of batteries for extending lifetime/durability/safety, 2) vehicle/battery optimization using data-driven machine learning, and 3) development of new and lightweight materials for cost-reduction and fuel efficiency. Thermal management, analysis of battery degradation, and development of high safety solid-state batteries are the main priorities in the UL site regarding improving the energy source of electric vehicles. Additional research efforts are directed at predictive maintenance and diagnosis using machine learning, intelligent motor control, and optimal design of human-vehicle interface to increase vehicle efficiency and safety.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
