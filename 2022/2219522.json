 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (RISE) program, Jackson State University will provide opportunities for underrepresented minority (URM) participants to become next generation STEM innovators through research and education on design of materials. The purposes of this project are to (a) significantly improve and expand the institution's research and educational capability on the 3D printing of nanocomposites and (b) to increase the number of URM students that join the next generation of US scientists. The project will provide minority participants from Jackson State University and other local K-12 schools the opportunity to acquire a comprehensive STEM education with components ranging from STEM research experiences to formal and informal lessons and conferences. \r\n\r\nJackson State University interdisciplinary faculty mentors will collaborate on a research project pertaining to the rational design of 3D printable nanocomposites, which will provide tremendous benefit for society in terms of deploying next-generation devices. The research activities will include (i) designing new strategies for the development of next generation nanocomposite materials using nature-inspired peptides and (ii) development of 3D printed nature-inspired nanocomposites. The goals of this project also align well within the ongoing developmental plan of Jackson State University to become one of the region\u2019s foremost centers on nanostructured materials manufacturing. The CREST HBCU-RISE awards support the development of research capability at Historically Black Colleges and Universities that offer doctoral degrees in science and engineering disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
