 "awd_abstract_narration": "By studying chemistry in the gas and dust that pervades the Milky Way, astronomers are able to better understand the birth of stars and planets and the way the galaxy changes over time. A team from the University of Virginia will continue their research on how large molecules are formed in dense regions where stars like our sun are born. This theoretical work may even lead to a better understanding of how life began on Earth. The proposers will also continue outreach and teaching efforts through their association with various university programs, most of which are committed to bringing people of all backgrounds and life experiences into scientific research. Graduate and undergraduate students will also participate in the research being proposed.\r\n\r\nThis project aims at modelling the formation of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the hot, inner regions of low-mass star forming cores. These so-called \u201cHot Corinos\u201d harbor molecules that are of prebiotic interest. Hot Corinos are therefore of great value as we develop a better understanding of the origins of life on Earth (and perhaps elsewhere). The project will combine chemical, radiative and magneto-hydrodynamical (RHD and MHD) models to explore the time- and spatially-dependent chemistry occurring in these sources during core collapse and the formation of a circumstellar disk, jet and protostar. The coupled models will seek to distinguish between heating mechanisms and will probe the influence of protostellar UV on the chemistry of the outflow cavity walls. The study will be of relevance to existing and future ALMA observations as well as upcoming observations of solid-phase molecules using the James Webb Space Telescope.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
