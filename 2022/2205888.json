 "awd_abstract_narration": "Principal Investigators Metcalfe and van Saders will take polarized spectra of a sample of stars to assess the strength and complexity of their magnetic fields.  For stars like our Sun, the stellar wind slowly escapes along the star\u2019s magnetic field lines and slows down the rate at which the star rotates over a period of billions of years. This process is called magnetic braking. Slowing rotation leads to a mid-life crisis and the magnetic field generation starts to fail. Stars switch from periods of activity (strong magnetic field with many flares, sunspots, and outbursts) to in-activity (weaker more complex magnetic field with reduced activity). Determining when and how these switches occur will improve our understanding of how stars age. To broaden participation the team plan to lead a 15-week \"Survival Skills for Scientists\" seminar at the University of Colorado and a summer Research Experience for Teachers at the University of Hawaii.\r\n\r\nThe team will observe 12 stars using the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI) at the Large Binocular Telescope combined with contemporaneous spectra using Las Cumbres Observatory's Network of Robotic Echelle Spectrographs (NRES) to determine the level of activity. Follow-up detailed magnetic field maps will be obtained using the Echelle SpectroPolarimetric Device for the Observation of Stars (ESPaDOnS) on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). The resulting constraints on how the properties of stellar magnetism depend on rotation and mass beyond middle-age will have implications for theoretical models of angular momentum loss from magnetized stellar winds, the use of gyrochronology as a technique for inferring stellar ages, and will inform predictions of long term \"space weather\" for the Sun and other planetary systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
