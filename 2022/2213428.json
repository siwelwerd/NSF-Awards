 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a virtual display technology for media, science education and other industries. This technology may have applications beyond traditional display markets, and include volumetric mobile platforms,  telepresence solutions in autonomous vehicles, and educators using immersive classroom experiences. Three-dimensional images and media cannot currently be projected onto a screen at large distances. The proposed technology projects 3D media and augmented reality without goggles, telepresence without screens, and large images from small devices. The proposed optical trap display may make it possible for scientists, designers, and engineers to customize designs for 3D visualization at lower costs. Democratizing this technology may accelerate the pace and diversity of augmented reality projects. Through these efforts, humans can interact with digital data as a physical part of the world around them.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a display that creates full-color, projected 3D images that can be seen from every angle. The technology can make images larger than currently available.  The projected images can wrap around the user without use of imaging goggles and can be generated with relatively low bandwidths compared to other 3D display technologies. This technology seeks to create free-space volumetric display. This solution uses a nearly invisible laser to move a micron-scale particle where it is illuminated by red, green, blue light to form an aerial 3D image. This technology is automatic and reusable. A prototype has been adapted for both experienced and novice designers and engineers. This technology can be applied to several industries and may become a valuable research tool to advance science.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
