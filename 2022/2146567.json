This project studies the effect of acoustic waves on the electrical and optical properties of atomically thin materials. These acoustic waves allow in-situ dynamic control of the properties of the materials. The goal of the project is to advance our knowledge of quantum properties in low-dimensional systems which is the key to developing new technologies, computers, and devices. The project strongly integrates education with research, to provide quantum research training for graduate and undergraduate students. The educational activities include the development of new coursework focused on cutting-edge quantum research and the introduction of new quantum physics experiments in the classroom. The outcome of these educational activities will also be disseminated in Spanish to reach out to the Hispanic community. Outreach activities, such as high school summer camps, laboratory visits, and public lectures have a special focus on science communication to the general public and the media. Recruiting efforts focuses on the integration of women, and underrepresented minorities, into the scientific community.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION\r\nThis CAREER project aims at creating a reconfigurable solid-state simulator of quantum many-body systems by developing a new and effective method to manipulate the dynamics of electrons and excitons in situ in atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures. The electrical and optical properties of different 2D materials and heterostructures under acoustically created dynamic strain patterns are investigated. This approach enables the creation of non-equilibrium quantum states and long-sought oblique spacetime crystals. This work can open up a new branch in condensed matter and optical physics of acoustic-driven phase transitions and acoustic control of quantum objects that will pave the way towards the creation of a solid-state quantum simulator and other quantum acousto-electric devices. The research outcome of this project will provide a foundation for educational activities focused on training graduate and undergraduate students of diverse backgrounds in quantum sciences. Several initiatives are implemented to foster the participation of underrepresented minorities and women in quantum sciences. These activities include multiple approaches to increasing public engagement in the sciences, including a high school science summer program, the inclusion of quantum experiments in the classroom, and the development of quantum-focused summer research programs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
