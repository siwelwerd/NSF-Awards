 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Luisa Whittaker-Brooks of the University of Utah is developing one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures for all solid-state electrochemical energy storage.  While electrochemical systems can store significant amounts of energy, the charging and discharging cycles lead to irreversible changes in the structure and composition of the electrode and electrolyte, degrading performance. Dr. Whittaker-Brooks and her students will use magnetic fields to make electrochemical systems more resistant to irreversible changes, and their discoveries could lead to batteries that store more energy and degrade more slowly. The project will also contribute to the development of a National STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce by providing research opportunities for postdoctoral scholars, graduate, and undergraduate students, as well as high school students, and the team will develop science demonstrations to introduce the concepts and research results to K-12 students at local schools. \r\n\r\nUnder this award, Luisa Whittaker-Brooks at the University of Utah will use non-covalent interactions to interface TiS2 (electrode) nanowires, Li10GeP2S12 (solid-state electrolyte), and self-doped perylene diimide organic small molecules (solid-electrolyte interphase modifier and magnetic moment inducers) to enable the design of magnetic moment-induced (non-metallic) vertically oriented 1D electrochemical systems where their electrochemical properties can be tuned under an applied magnetic field. The studies will integrate: (i) the synthesis and characterization of organic-inorganic heterostructures with tunable interfaces; (ii) elucidation of the electrochemical properties of heterostructures with an emphasis on interfacial charge/spin dynamics correlated to compositional and morphological characteristics; and (iii) the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and magnetometry to investigate and control heterogeneities, tailor interphases, and guide ion/charge transport in model systems under a magnetic field.  The studies could shed light on both materials design and modulation of fundamental physical phenomena by carefully elucidating the role of interfaces and solid-state crystal chemistries on the properties of organic-inorganic 1D heterostructures to promote adaptability, self-healing, control of the complex interphase region formed at dynamic interfaces, and the elimination of detrimental chemistries to extend the lifetime and improve the safety of electrochemical energy storage systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
