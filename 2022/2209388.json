 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2022, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways.  Differences in the DNA sequence of genes between individuals are known as genetic variants.  Scientists currently have unprecedented knowledge of human genetic variants due to advances in DNA sequencing.  Genetic variants can cause the physical differences we can see between individuals, known as phenotypes.  However, the mechanisms for how they do so are not completely understood.\r\nThis research investigates how genetic variants impact molecules called messenger RNAs (mRNAs).  mRNAs are instructions for making proteins that are copied from DNA and read by protein-making machinery.  Recently, scientists discovered that some gene sequences make it harder for protein-making making machinery to read mRNAs, causing the cell to destroy the mRNA.  This research seeks to identify genetic variants in humans that cause the mRNA to be destroyed in this way, ultimately causing phenotypes we observe.  The overall goal of this research is to understand how genetic variants cause phenotypes by altering the properties of mRNAs.   This knowledge will increase scientist\u2019s ability to predict how genetic variants will affect individuals.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal, the fellow will use a combination of high-throughput experimental and computational approaches to define the mechanism of missense mutations in regulating mRNA stability. Towards this goal, the research will identify amino acid motifs that alter mRNA stability by combining a novel massively parallel knock-in assay in cell culture and a machine learning model. The fellow will then define critical amino acid residues in the newly-translated protein chain and the ribosome that are essential for ribosome stalling using systematic mutations.  Finally, the fellow will apply the predictive models and mechanistic insights to define human genetic variants that drive phenotypic changes by altering translation and mRNA stability.  The proposed research will define a novel mechanism by which missense variants alter gene expression and lead to molecular, cellular and organismal phenotypes. It will provide a framework for predicting the functional relevance of single nucleotide variants in the human genome. Additionally, the fellow will gain training in state-of-the art techniques in DNA sequencing and machine learning.  Further, the fellow will mentor undergraduate interns, and will teach a graduate course module in computational biology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
