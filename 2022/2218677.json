 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern computing systems have moved beyond single-core\r\nsingle-processor devices to more modern multicore processors operating\r\nin networked systems and available in warehouse-scale clouds\r\npopularized by companies such as Amazon or Google. Future advances in\r\ncomputing power will likely come not mainly from faster devices, but\r\nby processing in inherently parallel and distributed environments, and\r\nby understanding how to exploit the parallelism inherent in many\r\nalgorithmic problems. Simultaneously, the world has entered the era of\r\n``big data'' with large data sets on which previously unthinkable\r\nsized problems with great economic and social impact need to be\r\nsolved. This new parallel, interconnected, big-data world specially\r\nrequires fundamental research on their algorithms, which are both\r\nparallel and distributed.The algorithms in this project address this\r\nimportant research challenge by building and developing new general\r\nframeworks for massively parallel computation.\r\n\r\nAs the main thrust of this project, the investigators will design\r\nfundamental and efficient algorithms for core massively parallel\r\ncomputations especially in the practical Massively Parallel\r\nComputation (MPC) framework. In particular, they will consider methods\r\nfor reducing the number of rounds in the MPC model as well as\r\ntradeoffs between rounds, memory, number of machines, and\r\ncommunication time. They seek to find new MPC algorithms for basic\r\ngraph problems such as connectivity, matching, vertex cover, maximal\r\nindependent set, as well as other basic string matching problems such\r\nas suffix trees, edit distance, and longest common\r\nsubsequence. Another focus is dynamic algorithms for massively\r\nparallel computation, which modify the output efficiently in a\r\nparallel/distributed setting based on frequent modifications of the\r\ninput and with direct applications in evolving social networks, the\r\nWorld Wide Web, road networks, scheduling systems among others. The\r\ninvestigators will augmenting current parallel\r\nenvironments/architectures with better data structures and\r\nabstractions to allow simplified and fast implementations of the\r\ncurrent fundamental algorithms that can be used in practice\r\nvia open-source codes.  The discoveries in this project will be\r\nintegrated into existing and new courses and books about parallel\r\nalgorithms, distributed algorithms, and foundations of big data.  The\r\nwealth of attractive open problems in these areas will provide both\r\nchallenging research topics and intuitive accessible problems to\r\ninspire students to enter research in computer science and\r\nmathematics. In particular the project will involve Ph.D. students and\r\npost-docs, undergraduate students, and even high-school students\r\n(especially students among minorities and women), many of whom will\r\ncontinue their research at other academic institutions and research\r\ncenters, further broadening the impact of this research.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
