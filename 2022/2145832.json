Past research has heavily focused on ion conductors with perfect prototype structures. As a result, further materials discovery was limited to incremental improvement and a narrow range of chemistry. In this project, with support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the principle investigator investigates structurally-disordered ion conductors with compositional flexibility that can potentially alleviate the industry\u2019s reliance on any single critical metal source which has broad societal impact. The project also integrates education and research to increase enrollment, diversity, and retention of STEM students, creating America\u2019s future STEM workforce. In pursuit of these goals, the PI creates demonstration kits for college teaching and K-12 outreach, a crystal growth course with hands-on research-based activities, and a novel augmented reality experience for interactive crystallography pedagogy. The PI collaborates with the Utah STEM Action Center to reach students from backgrounds underrepresented in STEM and school districts historically underperforming in STEM and deliver them the kits and demonstrations. \r\n\r\nTechnical Summary: The facile transport of ions in crystalline materials enables key functionality in various devices, such as batteries, membranes, and fuel cells. The structural characterization of these materials, however, presents an outstanding challenge. Their crystal structures often exhibit short-range order, whereas traditional diffraction-based techniques are only sensitive to long-range periodic features. As a result, past research either had to ignore it for lack of instrument sensitivity or avoided it completely for fear of complexity and unpredictability. This CAREER project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research,  overcomes these difficulties by performing state-of-the-art synchrotron and neutron scattering on judiciously selected ion conductors, to precisely characterize these structural subtleties in both the mobile ion and the framework sublattices. The project also systematically modifies the chemistry and synthesis variables and correlate these parameters with structural observations and property measurements to reveal previously overlooked structure-property relationships. These insights enable the design of disruptively new materials with fast ion transport and excellent economic sustainability. The PI also engages in a series of education and outreach activities by taking an approach centering on research-based, hands-on activities, to reinforce cognitive knowledge and retention and stimulate students\u2019 interest in higher STEM education and careers. Specific efforts include: (1) outreach to middle and high schools with STEM activity kits; (2) expansion of the hands-on lab sessions in a crystal growth course; and (3) creation of an augmented reality app for interactive crystallography pedagogy.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
