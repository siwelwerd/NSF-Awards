 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the lens of archaeological science, geochemical datasets can produce specific and accurate descriptions of where people lived and migrated, raw material provisioning, object biographies, technological trends, and socioeconomic and cultural exchange. Such data advance current theoretical understandings of cultural evolution and adaptations, and can inform modern studies of population movements, resource exploitation, social networks, and land-use patterns. To this end, the Archaeometry Laboratory at the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) specializes in the provenance and compositional analysis of archaeological materials including ceramics, chert, obsidian, pigments, and metals. The long-term success of the Archaeometry Laboratory has resulted in an unparalleled database of artifact and raw material chemical compositions that enhance the explanatory power of future analytical studies as well as provide the raw material for large-scale research projects using existing data. The laboratory supports a wide variety of projects, trains students, graduate interns, researchers, and visiting scholars every year, and contributes to knowledge diffusion through close scientific collaborations between MURR staff and outside researchers, student education, and professional publications.\r\n\r\nThe MURR Archaeometry Laboratory focuses on elemental and isotopic analysis in order to examine the production, exchange, and movement of a broad variety of artifacts using neutron activation analysis (NAA), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) including a laser ablation system and a multi-collector. The laboratory also supports geochemical research on the petrogenesis of various igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. Broader impacts of the Archaeometry Laboratory at MURR include: (1) availability of affordable chemical and isotopic analyses for students and faculty from academic departments and non-profit research organizations in the US; (2) training of undergraduate and graduate students in the selection and use of laboratory methods of analysis; (3) advice in project design, statistical analysis, and interpretation of the chemical and isotopic data; and (4) public access by archaeologists, geologists, and scientists from many disciplines to the compositional database.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
