 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to serve the national need of preparing high-quality mathematics teachers who have the knowledge and skills to improve mathematical outcomes for all middle and high school students. Current approaches to preparing prospective secondary mathematics teachers, such as building an equity mindset, implementing culturally relevant pedagogy, and developing academic literacy are typically pursued in silos. This project aims to transform a traditional teacher credential program into a subject matter-driven integrated program in which prospective mathematics teachers simultaneously undertake mathematics content and mathematics specific pedagogy while also learning evidence-based intervention strategies both for typically developing students and students with mild to moderate disabilities. This approach has the potential to revolutionize mathematics teaching and learning in high-need urban schools. Considering the reported number of students who do not meet standards in mathematics, especially students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and with disabilities, this project's innovative approach to mathematics teacher preparation is critical to disrupting the status quo. This project will support 30 mathematics majors over a period of five years who will develop, implement, and refine integrated instructional practices as they complete a B.A. in Mathematics with a minor in special education and a single subject credential in mathematics. \r\n\r\nThis project at San Jose State University includes partnerships with East Side Union High School District and Campbell Union School District. Three goals guide this project. First, the project will produce 30 new secondary mathematics teachers over five years with deep integrated instructional skills to serve the needs of all students. Second, the project will establish a STEM content-driven and integrated-by-design teacher preparation program. Third, the investigators will identify integrated strategies and examine outcomes of these strategies for effectively implementing mathematical literacy-driven instructional practices using culturally-relevant and social-justice oriented performance tasks. The underlying theoretical framework for organizing prospective mathematics teacher learning incorporates a formative-assessment design teaching cycle process along with the research-derived Pathway to Equitable Math Instruction resource guide and toolkit for supporting all learners. The project will advance knowledge of how to prepare 21st century secondary mathematics teachers who possess the mindset, skills, and knowledge to create and support high-impact mathematical literacy-driven instruction and learning in inclusive mathematics classrooms. Formative evaluation including surveys and interviews will provide ongoing feedback for continuous improvement in the following areas: how well the project attracts participants; how well prospective mathematics teachers are prepared for the work of teaching in high need schools; and how well the project is able to retain beginning teachers in high-need schools. The project team, Advisory Board, and external evaluation team will generate summative assessments, gauge success, identify concerns, and provide recommendations for implementing timely change. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM mentor teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the retention and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
