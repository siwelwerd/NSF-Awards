This workshop is a satellite conference of the virtual 2022 International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) for Section 7 (Lie Theory and Generalizations). Several invited speakers will be delivering their ICM lectures at the meeting. The ICM Emmy Noether Lecture will also be delivered at this meeting. The objectives of this workshop are to present and discuss the latest research results in representation theory, one of the fundamental branches of mathematics, as well as their interactions and applications in other domains, such as number theory, analysis, mathematical physics. It will provide participants the opportunity to share points of view and ideas and to begin or strengthen collaborations. It will also give graduate students and early-career researchers the opportunity to interact with experts in the field. \r\n\r\nThe scientific focus of the workshop is the theory of representations of reductive groups over local fields. The workshop will put special emphasis on characters and matrix coefficients, in connection with the recent developments of representation theory, especially those related to the theta correspondence for the Weil representation and those related to general branching problems for representations. The conference webpage is https://ims.nus.edu.sg/events/representations-and-characters-revisiting-some-aspects-of-the-works-of-harish-chandra-and-weil/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
