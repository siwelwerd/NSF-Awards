 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gulf Stream current in the North Atlantic Ocean transports a large amount of warm water from south to north. Much of this heat is lost to the atmosphere as cold winds blow over the ocean. This heat loss causes local changes in the solubility of carbon dioxide in seawater and increases mixing of the upper ocean. Both of these impacts affect the ocean\u2019s ability to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Knowledge of the ocean\u2019s carbon uptake in this region is important for our ability to understand and predict the global carbon cycle that determines atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Conditions in the Gulf Stream region change rapidly and are hard to sample, however. In this project, investigators will deploy a robotic glider for several weeks to measure temperature and salinity in the upper 1000 meters of the Gulf Stream region. The glider will overlap with other robotic vehicles called Saildrones that take measurements of surface waters and the atmosphere. Together these vehicles will produce a picture of ocean conditions and carbon uptake that is not possible with short-term sampling from ships. This project will support an early career scientist, a postdoctoral scholar, and a graduate student.\r\n\r\nIn this project, the Principal Investigators (PIs) will deploy one autonomous glider during the late spring-early summer of 2022 that will measure subsurface ocean properties in upper 1000 m of the Gulf Stream region. This glider will target the waters around three Saildrones that are deployed in this area through an independent project funded by Google.org.  Uncrewed surface vehicles such as Saildrone autonomously measure surface oceanic and atmospheric variables at high temporal resolution but generally lack subsurface observations.  The water column data from the glider and the surface data from the Saildrones will allow the PIs to test the effectiveness of the synergy of the glider-Saildrone combination as a method to holistically characterize the ocean variability on the scale of tens of kilometers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe strong currents found along the western edge of all the major oceanic basins in the world have a significant impact on how the ocean absorbs and stores heat and carbon dioxide, thus influencing the global climate of our planet. Despite this importance, our current understanding of the processes that drive the exchange of carbon between the surface ocean, the deep ocean, and the atmosphere in these turbulent currents is limited, hindering our ability to accurately predict the future evolution of the climate system. One major reason why these regions are so poorly understood is the lack of in situ observations at the relevant scales in space and time. To help address this gap in scientific knowledge, this study collected unique subsurface observations using an autonomous underwater vehicle in the region near the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe field campaign funded by this project consisted of preparing, deploying, piloting, and recovering a Seaglider during the spring of 2022. Seagliders are underwater vehicles that change their buoyancy to move up and down through the water and change their pitch and roll to move horizontally. Our study was particularly novel in that the underwater glider sampled for over 3 months in the same approximate location as two Saildrone vehicles which were continuously collecting data in the lower atmosphere and surface ocean. Saildrones are uncrewed, wind-driven surface vehicles that are piloted by a shore-based team via satellite communications. Furthermore, during this project, our collaborators gathered a research vessel (the R/V Endeavor) with the glider and Saildrone vehicles to make high resolution vertical profiles in a transect from the New England shelf to just north of the Gulf Stream. Data from the glider is available to the public at https://gandalf.gcoos.org/; Saildrone data has been uploaded to Global Telecommunications Systems, which is assimilated into weather prediction systems. A significant outcome of this project was improved understanding of the advantages and challenges of co-locating multiple different observing assets in turbulent oceanic regions in order to obtain optimal data return. This knowledge will ultimately enable deeper understanding of the air-sea interactions that impact the oceans ability to take up and store carbon dioxide.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to supporting the novel data collection activities described above, this project benefited the career development of an early career scientist. A University of Washington graduate student received training on autonomous ocean glider data collection, processing, and quality control and has submitted a manuscript detailing machine-learning methods she developed to synthesize observations collected by multiple autonomous platforms. In addition this graduate student participated in the R/V Endeavor cruise when all observing assets were gathered in one location north of the Gulf Stream.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AlisonGray\n"
