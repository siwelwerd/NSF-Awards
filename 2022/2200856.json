 "awd_abstract_narration": "The international conference \"Bundles and Conformal Blocks with a Twist\" will take place June 13-17 2022 at the International Center for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, Scotland. The aim of this event is to bring together a diverse group of researchers, from a mixture of fields and in different stages of their careers, to disseminate recent work, to foster collaborations, and to develop future connections. It is the first conference on the subject and this grant provides support for US-based participants. The conference website is at https://twistedcb.wixsite.com/conferenceicms. \r\n \r\nThe main research foci of the conference are geometric representation theory, differential and algebraic geometry, and cohomological/topological field theory. In particular the conference will focus on three interconnected topics: (a) parahoric torsors and their moduli spaces, (b) twisted conformal blocks, their properties and relations with moduli spaces of parahoric torsors, (c) topological and cohomological field theories and their generalizations which arise from (twisted) conformal blocks. The conference will follow the usual format with research talks and an introductory lecture series that the organizers hope will be a fundamental review article for the subject.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
