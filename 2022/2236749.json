 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) program supports a broad spectrum of investigators advancing computational understanding of nervous system structure and function, mechanisms underlying nervous system disorders, and computational strategies used by the nervous system. The goal of this meeting of CRCNS Principal Investigators is to foster interaction and collaboration across this vibrant community, highlighting the intellectual advances and broader impacts of CRCNS awardees. The meeting, scheduled for Oct. 27-28, 2022 in Atlanta, GA, is co-hosted by Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology and includes poster presentations, talks, and plenary lectures, covering all areas of computational neuroscience represented by funded projects in the program. This international meeting will include projects involving researchers from the United States, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, and Spain, sponsored by NSF and eight other partner agencies.\r\n\r\nThis international meeting should have a significant impact on the participants and the future of the CRCNS program. The meeting results are likely to include new research directions that will be publicized to the research community through publications and the meeting website. The results dissemination should inform and the CRCNS research community in their transdisciplinary collaboration, educational activities, and spur other innovative research directions. The broader impacts of the meeting are to facilitate progress in the field and stimulate conversations, connections, and collaborations that will lead toward better informed and effective CRCNS research and resulting technologies for the broadest possible user populations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
