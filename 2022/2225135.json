 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports research that generates new knowledge of how humans and virtual reality systems interact to help learn motor skills for physical rehabilitation.   When humans put on a virtual reality headset, they are transported into an immersive digital world that can be anything or anywhere. Recent advancements of virtual reality systems make it so that these digital worlds closely mimic the real-world -- opening up many possibilities to train rehabilitative skills. However, in order for this potential to be fully realized, a better understanding of the components of immersive virtual environments that translate to real-world motor skill development is needed. Correspondingly, this award supports the fundamental research of human movements and experiences linked to learning in virtual reality environments that best fit their learning needs. Findings from the current study will benefit the U.S. economy and society as many schools and workplaces are using virtual reality systems to provide people with scalable training of complex motor skills. To properly examine the complexities of motor learning in virtual worlds, this project involves researchers from several disciplines including mechanical engineering, kinesiology, psychology, and vision science. Moreover, the multi-disciplinary approach of this project helps broaden participation of underrepresented groups, along with aids to bridge gaps between engineering and social science research fields.  \r\n\r\nThe multidisciplinary research team in this project will develop two dynamic human-virtual reality interaction systems\u2014one involving walking through a virtual world while avoiding obstacles, and the other controlling a prosthetic arm and hand with a foot controller. Each system includes a virtual reality headset with strategically designed adaptive environments that scale to the skill level of the user, and other subsystems to record vital user data such as gait, eye gaze behaviors, and toe tapping events (while controlling the prosthesis). The developed systems rely on various sensors, such as eye trackers, 3D motion capture systems, foot controller insoles, that can fully capture the biomechanics of the users and their strategies in performing the assigned tasks. Analyzing the collected data will lead to clearer understanding of the bidirectional relationships between humans and the virtual reality systems during motor learning or rehabilitation tasks\u2014humans enhancing their skills, and the VR system adapting to the user needs. This research will fill a knowledge gap in the human-virtual reality interaction research by demonstrating the potential of virtual reality to improve learning and rehabilitation through the designed systems.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
