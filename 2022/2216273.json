 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.  Grinnell College is acquiring an upgraded console for a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer with a diffusion probe to support the research of Professor Andrew Mobley and colleagues Erick Leggans, Leslie Lyons, Molly MacInnes, and Stephen Sieck.  This instrument facilitates research in the areas of organic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, natural products, and material science.  In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of students at all levels in many departments at Grinnell College as well as provides accessibility for use at nearby institutions.  The instrument also enables the research groups to work actively to recruit students from a diverse background and broaden the representation of minoritized groups in the sciences.\r\n\r\nThe award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing the research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as organic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, natural products, and material science. The instrument impacts research focused on advancing the understanding of heterobimetallic complexes and ion transport in electrolytes and graphitic networks. Specifically, the instrument will be used in a wide spectrum of projects such as: 1) heteronuclear NOE and NMR-relaxation studies of Sn hydride complexes of W and Pt, 2) detailed variable temperature structural studies of the conformational behavior of the natural product lugdunin, 3) structural determination of the interaction between solvent and metal ions in electrolytes for Li-ion and Na batteries, 4) self-diffusion studies of Li, Na, and Ln ions in graphitic suspensions, and 5) J-coupling studies to determine the configuration and solution state conformation of novel chalcones. The research projects to be enabled by the 400MHz NMR spectrometer could lead to impacts in the fields such as energy storage and biotechnology.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
