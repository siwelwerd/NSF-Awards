 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of synthetic mucins (analogs of mucus) to impact the skincare, healthcare, and materials industries. Initially, the synthetic mucus will be explored as anti-aging, moisturizing skincare ingredients, and will replace natural mucins derived from animals. Importantly, the synthetic methods may allow for the synthesis of diverse mucin analogs, with varying material and biological properties. Following the development of synthetic mucins for skincare, the team will develop materials for transdermal delivery, biocompatible lubrication, and surgical adhesives. The synthetic analogs of mucus can aid in understanding the role of mucus in digestive, respiratory, and immune systems. The additional broader impacts include launching a new US-based, high-tech material manufacturing company, creating new markets for mucins, and providing nontoxic skincare, healthcare, and biomedical solutions, where no other adequate alternative exists.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of synthetic materials that mimic the structures and properties of animal mucus. Animals secrete different mucus for a variety of functions, including lubrication, hydration, and adhesion. The team has recently developed a synthetic analog of snail mucin that is a substitute for the snail mucus filtrate currently used in hydrating skincare products. The synthetic mucin is a water-soluble glycosylated polypeptide that can be produced on the kilogram scale. Currently, synthetic mucins are only produced on the milligram scale or have chemical compositions that do not fully mimic the composition or properties of the natural mucins. The proposed technology reresenets a scalable synthesis of a glycosylated polypeptide that re-creates all the salient structural and physical characteristics of snail mucins.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
