 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V Blue Heron, an 86-foot Coastal research vessel owned by the University of Minnesota and operated by the Large Lakes Observatory as part of the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF). Built in 1985 for fishing on the Grand Banks, the Blue Heron was purchased by the University of Minnesota in 1997. The vessel is outfitted with state-of-the-art research equipment, has berthing for 11 crew and scientists, and can operate 24 hours per day for up to 21 days in between port calls. The Blue Heron is part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) and is available for charter by research scientists on any of the Great Lakes. In 2021, the vessel completed 51 funded days, 31 of these (61%) were for NSF. In 2022, the vessel is scheduled for 69 days, 53 of which (77%) will be for NSF.\r\n\r\nOceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:\r\n1)\tAcoustic Releases with links\t$77,752\r\n2)\tCarousel Water Sampler with bottles\t$56,999\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$134,751\r\nBroader Impacts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe University of Minnesota Duluth purchased five acoustic releases, a back-up Carousel water sampler, and 14 8L water bottles for the equipment pool for the research vessel Blue Heron using funds provided by the National Science Foundation award OCE#2218074 \"University of Minnesota/RV Blue Heron 2022 Oceanographic Instrumentation\". The acoustic releases, back-up Carousel water sampler, and 14 8L water bottles will allow the vessel to better serve the researchers who use the vessel.\n\n\n\n\n\nRV Blue Heron deploys scientific mooring throughout the Great Lakes and recovers the moorings using acoustic releases. The releases we currently have on hand are between 13 and 20 years old. Adding newer units ensures that we will be able to successfully deploy and recover scientific moorings into the future. Our CTD/Carousel and water sampling bottle system is over 20 years old and is the most heavily used piece of scientific equipment we have on board the vessel. By replacing the Carousel and water sampling bottles we not only ensured that we would be able to continue to collect water samples for researchers but allows us to use the older unit as a spare in case the equipment fails.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new equipment is available to all users of R/V Blue Heron, including the three National Science Foundation funded projects that are using the vessel in 2024. Besides the NSF funded projects, we are supporting several other science projects in 2024: three cruises funded by the Legislative-Citizens Commission on Minnesota Resources, several Sea Grant cruises, a State of Minnesota Department of Natural Resources cruise, and multiple research and educational cruises funded by the University of Minnesota. Regarding the educational cruises, the University of Minnesota is funding nine cruises in 2024 which will expose close to 200 undergraduates to scientific research on the Great Lakes.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/13/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RichardDRicketts\n"
