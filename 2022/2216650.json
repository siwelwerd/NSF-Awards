 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current plant research and conservation workforce is not adequate to meet the major environmental challenges of the coming decades that include biodiversity loss, climate change, food insecurity, and environmental degradation. The United States is facing severe shortages of botanically trained scientists, now and in the near future, as well as a decline in degree programs and course offerings in botany and plant science in universities which also threatens the management of our nation\u2019s resources. There is an urgent need for major advances in broadening participation in the sciences from historically marginalized groups, including engagement in plant research and conservation. In order to address this major training gap, the Rare Plant RaMP Network, a collaborative team, will be assembled from four botanical gardens: the Atlanta Botanical Garden, California Botanic Garden, the Morton Arboretum, and the San Diego Botanic Garden. These organizations will train postbaccalaureate mentees in conservation, genetics, ecology, economic botany, and biogeography of rare plants. The Rare Plant RaMP Network will consist of researchers, scientists, and conservation professionals at each institution who will serve as mentors and co-mentors and engage three cohorts of eight mentees each with each participating institution serving two mentees per year. Recruitment practices will include participants from groups underrepresented in STEM; these baccalaureates will then engage in Broader Impacts activities that will support them during the program. \r\n\r\nThe five objectives of the Rare Plant RaMP Network are to 1) provide career guidance and professional development to post-baccalaureate mentees; 2) broaden participation in botanical sciences and conservation; 3) empower mentees to perform independent and collaborative research that will strengthen their ability to communicate science to other researchers, policymakers, and the general public; 4) form a cohort of peers whose lasting bonds/relationships will provide opportunities for collaborative work in the years to come; and 5) improve the mentoring skills and capacities of researchers in botanical science organizations. To improve mentee experiences, mentors and co-mentors will be trained in inclusive mentoring practices. Mentees and co-mentors will take part in bi-weekly meetings focusing on professional development topics, an annual symposium at one of the participating institutions, and one national conference per year. The network will be collaborative, exchange ideas, and foster long-term relationships among participants and collaborating organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
