 "awd_abstract_narration": "As we move deeper into the era of personalized devices that perform with minimal human active input and vast data from mutually interactive devices, the rapid and intelligible display of relevant, sufficient, and precise data is critical. Next-generation personal wearable electronics, such as smartwatches and augmented-reality glasses, will have versatile, although miniature, display panels for communications, social media, navigation, imaging, health monitoring, eye tracking, gesture recognition, etc. The U.S. needs to regain leadership in handling data in diverse and rapidly changing display formats, all the more so because developments in numerous other technologies are affected and promoted by display technology. A 16-graduate-student cohort from the U.S. will visit two different Taiwanese institutions during two consecutive summers for intensive training through two Advanced Studies Institutes (ASI) in display technology and display manufacturing. Along with a cohort of 16 Taiwanese graduate students, the cohort from the U.S. will be immersed in a series of short courses and laboratory projects on various aspects of cutting edge display technologies, novel applications, and wearable devices/systems, as well as key display manufacturing knowledge. The selected students will become natural leaders as public transport systems, personalized vehicles, healthcare, food production, education, and other fields incorporate advanced display systems for monitoring data and controlling operations. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to nucleate a scientific workforce to design and manufacture next-generation display products in the U.S. Advancement of future display technologies and technical capabilities has necessitated a collaborative effort between globally engaged researchers in both academia and industry. A cohort of 16 U.S. graduate-students will participate in a week-long Advanced Studies Institutes (ASIs) in Taiwan for two consecutive years devoted to disruptive techniques in display materials and device architectures. This will help to greatly improve American expertise for producing existing display products at reasonable cost as well as for conceiving novel display products for long-term benefits to industry and society in future. Taiwan is a global manufacturing leader in optics and electronics. The ASIs will be hosted by two Taiwanese universities, National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT) and National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU). Grouped among the top three research institutions in photonics and electronics in Taiwan, and having produced industry leaders and entrepreneurs in display technologies, both hosting universities will leverage their manufacturing connections to organize industrial visits for the American students. The first-year ASI hosted by NTUT will cover innovative materials and structures for next-generation display technology, while the second year ASI hosted by NYCU will focus on advanced display devices and systems in the era of wearable electronics. Along with a cohort of 16 Taiwanese graduate students, the American students will be immersed in a series of 41 hours of lectures and 24 hours of laboratory projects on various aspects of cutting-edge display technologies, novel applications, and wearable devices/systems, as well as key display manufacturing knowledge. The Organizating  Committee comprises professors from The Pennsylvania State University, University of Dayton, NTUT, and NYCU, as well as personnel from industries in Taiwan and the U.S. Progress towards project goals will be evaluated with a focus on the effectiveness of student recruitment and retention across the two years, professional development, and cross-cultural experiences and competencies developed between students from the two countries.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
