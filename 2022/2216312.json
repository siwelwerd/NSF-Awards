 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award supports the acquisition of a class 1, pico-second laser and a complementary reverse-pulse electroplating system for North Carolina State University (NC State). These tools will greatly enhance the fabrication capabilities of the university which also serves researchers from nearby universities, colleges, high schools, and industry. The equipment will find immediate use in a wide range of research activities led by the PI, 3 co-PIs, and 16 senior personnel in the areas of electronics, materials engineering, and biology. Moreover, the instruments will be located in the Nanofabrication Facility (NNF), a shared facility and part of the Research Triangle Nanotechnology Network (RTNN), which will ensure easy access to a rich variety of users from NC State, local universities and industry. This will create technological impact by enabling new strategies for processing materials, synthesizing unconventional nano/micro materials, and fabricating devices while stimulating new inter and intra-university research and strengthen NC State\u2019s relationships with industry. The proposed instruments are uniquely suited for training next generation researchers with a low learning curve since the tool accepts standard computer aided design files and includes an intuitive user interface. This creates the opportunity to involve and educate undergraduates, graduates, and high school students, as well as teachers from nearby high schools and community colleges through existing outreach programs. The tools will therefore be useful for various advanced research and training purposes. \r\n\r\nThe pico-second laser will allow cutting/patterning of features as small as 20 microns and can process a wide range of materials (soft, hard, organic, inorganic, metallic) for applications ranging from energy to inorganics, electronics, biomedical systems, and soft materials. The tool is especially useful in processing materials that are either incompatible and/or result in poor resolution when patterned using conventional tools such as standard lithography, printing, or carbon dioxide lasers. The laser is particularly useful in heterogenous fabrication crucial for realizing next-generation devices that are not easily achievable through conventional techniques. The PI/co-PIs and senior personnel intend to  process numerous materials such as polymers, carbon nanomaterials, metals, inorganics, glass, silicon, paper, and textiles for 1) tissue-integrated sensors; 2) organic, semiconducting, and self-folding electronics; 3) robotics and actuators; 4) opto-electronic materials; and 5) microfluidics.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
