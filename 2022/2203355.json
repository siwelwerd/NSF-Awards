 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to have maximal impact on mathematics at all levels. At the research level, the project introduces new geometric points of view to our understanding of 4-dimensional spaces. These spaces arise whenever 4 parameters arise, for example keeping track of the 3-dimensional position of an airplane together with the time it is at that position. The project will develop new methods to understand symmetries of these spaces, starting with ``K3 manifolds'', a fundamental example arising in physics. The project will also lead to the training of several PhD students; continue the PI's public outreach in the media; and contribute to work for diversity in mathematics by continuing the PI's work with the Math Alliance.\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes to introduce the Thurstonian point-of-view into the study of mapping class groups of K3 surfaces. Specific goals include: Thurston trichotomy; Thurston normal form; Nielsen (non)realization; new beautiful examples/constructions.  In a second direction, the PI proposes a guiding principle, motivated by the miraculous constructions of algebraic geometry, that produces many natural, motivated problems and conjectures in geometric group theory, topology and algebraic geometry, concerning various forms of rigidity for many different moduli spaces. The PI will also train graduate students and conduct outreach as part of broader impacts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
