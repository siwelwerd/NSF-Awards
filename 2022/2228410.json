 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the potential development of a tissue-engineered intervertebral disc that may treat intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. IVD degeneration is one of the leading causes of disability among Americans. Currently, chronic back pain due to intervertebral disc degeneration costs US $100 billion per year. In addition, up to 60% of discs in 70-year-old patients have severely degenerated, and 20% of discs in 20-year-old patients have mild signs of degeneration. With the rapid increase in the global median age, a greater number of people could suffer debilitating pain related to IVD degeneration. Currently, there are two surgical intervention techniques available for IVD degeneration, discectomy and spinal fusion. However, these two techniques may not treat the underlying cause of the disease, and research indicates that these approaches lead to the degeneration of adjacent IVDs. The proposed technology may benefit both patients and orthopedic/neurosurgeons. Patients may be alleviated from the debilitating pain and the economic burden. Surgeons may benefit from simplified surgical procedures, ultimately reducing operative time and costs. \r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of a tissue-engineered (TE) intervertebral disc (IVD) with a 3-D printed biodegradable cage to potentially treat intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. The IVD is an candidate for the TE solution, as the disc tissue has innate limitations to its regenerative capabilities. The proposed technology is a TE IVD construct to regenerate the function of the native tissue. Recent animal study results have shown its efficacy to potentially treat damaged IVDs. However, replicating the mechanical properties of the native tissue remains a challenge. In the early stages of implantation, TE IVD constructs do not have sufficient mechanical properties to withstand in vivo loads. Such a lack of mechanical robustness causes dislocation and collapse of the tissue. However, TE IVD constructs that survived the early implantation stage were successfully integrated in vivo. To provide extra mechanical support, the proposed technology includes a 3-D printed biodegradable cage that may protect the soft TE IVD constructs until integration with the host tissue is achieved and the constructs can withstand in vivo loads.  In addition, to best match the anatomical geometry of individual patients, a finite element model has been developed to potentially predict the structural response in vivo and optimize the topology of the cage.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
