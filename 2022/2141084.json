 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation - Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to design gas sensing applications for farming and industrial operations.  The National Academy of Engineering has identified \u201cManaging the Nutrients\u201d as a Grand Challenge.  The proposed project will develop a field-deployable and portable gas sensing system for reliable and affordable assessment of farm health and safety, improving the real-time monitoring of environmental impacts. The gas sensor has commercial applications in industries such as steel, cement, and chemical manufacturing. The project will also train a new generation of workforce trained towards environmental hazard monitoring and taking research to practice.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will advance a novel fiber-optic, field-deployable, wireless, multiplexed gas sensing system for monitoring field/farm and industrial emissions. This project will develop a first-of-a-kind optical sensing system capable of detecting field-released potent greenhouse gases CH4 and CO2, and farm-emitted health hazards NH3 and H2S, which are produced in agriculture/animal-farming operation as well as in industrial setting. Unlike the existing sensing methodologies (e.g., gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, electrochemical sensors, commercial artificial noses, and existing state-of-the-art optical gas detection technologies), the proposed sensing system is low-cost and provides the ppm-level limit-of-detection required of the target gases. The intellectual merit includes: (1) an integrated and reusable gas sensing system with higher selectivity through a 2-tiered approach of target specific functionalization together with coupled design-diversity and data-analytics for cross-sensitivity reduction and sensitivity/specificity improvement, and (2) Data analytics for dynamic runtime calibration together with time-division multiplexing to support continuous monitoring.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
