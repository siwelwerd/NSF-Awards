 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the potential development of a field-testing regimen and a long-term, on-site health monitor for highway structures. This technology seeks to develop a smart and secured data gateway to integrate the data from emerging, heterogeneous cyberphysical systems and provide a seamless dashboard for transportation officials to make quick and informed actions. As a service, this technology could provide real-time traffic information such as vehicle counts, vehicle/pedestrian/wildlife classifications, and a combination of strategic alliances with private transportation agencies that are contracted to create safe traffic intersections and roundabouts. The proposed technology could also scale existing software to provide analytics such as bike and pedestrian detection, near misses, real-time asset monitoring, and the ability to provide computer-based modeling.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the potential development of a robust, yet adaptive smart data gateway to monitor the health of highway infrastructture.  The gateway must be capable of supporting the diverse data formats used in heterogeneous cyberphysical systems. The ability to connect  nearby cyberphysical systems to historical data in each location is challenging; The smart data gateway should connect and continuously stream data between the heterogeneous cyberphysical systems. In addition, the gateway should process the incoming data in real-time, detect the correct data format, check for any malicious data points, process the data using artificial intelligence (AI) models to prioritize the data, derive patterns, display the relevant data in the dashboard, and relay proper responses to the corresponding systems.  As a service, this technology could provide real-time traffic information to create safer traffic intersections and roundabouts.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
