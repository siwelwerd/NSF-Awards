 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is jointly supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Programs. Tulane University is acquiring a 600 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with a helium-cooled probe to support the research of Professor Bruce Gibb and colleagues Nathalie Busschaert, Stassi DiMaggio, and Janarthanan Jayawickramarajah. This instrument facilitates research in the areas of structural biology, supramolecular chemistry, polymer chemistry, and organic chemistry. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The cryogenic probe provides a significant increase in sensitivity relative to standard NMR probes. This instrument enhances the educational, research, and teaching efforts of a diverse population of students at all levels.  This instrument enables these activities for over 16 research groups from Tulane University and regional institutions in the New Orleans, southeast Louisiana, and southern Mississippi regions including Xavier University and Loyola University of New Orleans. \r\n\r\nThe award of the 600 MHz NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as synthetic polymers, superconductors, membrane structures, inorganic complexes, and host guest interactions. This instrument enables research in a variety of projects including the synthesis of polymer architectures, supramolecular chemistry at membranes, characterization of nano-material platforms for drug-delivery, and the identification and characterization of inorganic complexes.  It also assists in the study of abiotic and biotic aqueous supramolecular chemistry, polymer design for drug delivery, and the structure of functionalized synthetic DNA-based assemblies. Further investigations include designing agents for cancer cell imaging, studying polypeptiod interactions with lipid bilayers, conformational flexibility in CD4+ T-cell epitope processing, the synthesis of low-coordinate, low-valent metal complexes, and the NMR detection of small molecule binding to target proteins.  Additionally, the instrument facilitates the understanding of the unusual structure and bonding in complex aromatic molecules, the development of novel organic superconductors, transition metal complex chromophores and light harvesting ensembles, catalysis with porous materials, and new rhodamine dyes as chiral sensors.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
