 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a combined Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Physical Virology: Viruses at multiple levels of complexity and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), to be held Jan 22-27, 2023 in Lucca (Barga), Italy. The biennial GRC aims to transform the study of these processes by establishing Physical Virology as a paradigm for the intersection of fundamental physical laws and emergent biological function. The meeting brings together researchers with scientific expertise in virology, chemistry, materials science, mathematics, physics, and engineering who share a common desire to (1) understand the physical mechanisms that enable and regulate viral lifecycles, (2) use this knowledge to develop and engineer novel nanotechnology platforms based on viral particles or other self -assembling structures, with applications including biomimetic materials and optoelectronics, and (3) broaden physical virology to leverage recent advances in cell biology and protein design. The associated GRS workshop is a school that takes place immediately prior to the main (GRC) conference. The GRS is organized by a graduate student and a postdoc. The school will feature 11 talks by students and postdocs; a career and mentorship panel discussion comprised of individuals invited from industry, academia, and science communication. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for these cross-disciplinary approaches to understand viral biology, predict global spread and impact, and generate the fundamental knowledge that provides the foundation for developing new treatments.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this award include fostering interdisciplinary science, increasing the diversity, equity, and inclusivity (DEI) of the Physical Virology community, and the training and career development for early career researchers.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
