 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ADVANCEGeo Partnership for transforming workplace climate aims to enact interventions at the individual and collective level through behavior change education and organizationally through implementation of ethical codes of conduct that frame harassment, bullying, and discrimination as scientific misconduct. The project will develop: (1) a workplace climate intervention program for academic departments and future faculty training programs; (2) a train-the-trainers\u2019 certification and capacity-building program to engage and activate a diverse team of STEM leaders; (3) online public scaffolded resources for broader engagement in workplace climate interventions; and (4) a plan for sustained national impact across STEM through our extended partnerships and new collaborations. The project leverages collaborations with professional associations for nationwide impact and builds on prior work (NSF 1725879) with professional societies. The enhanced network of partners and collaborators aims to engage and support a diverse cohort of trainers and expand the program\u2019s reach into multiple STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nWhile hostile STEM workplace environments have disproportionate impacts on individuals that are members of historically excluded groups, everyone in STEM benefits from thriving, inclusive, just, and equitable research and educational environment. The strategic impacts of the project include: (1) Empowering STEM departments and programs to intentionally reduce the prevalence and impact of hostile workplace climates through community engagement and responsibility; (2) Activating a broader community of faculty, staff and scientists in the work to create thriving research and training environments; and (3) Increasing retention of faculty in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.  Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate.  ADVANCE \"Partnership\" awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based strategies to academic, non-profit institutions of higher education and non-academic, non-profit organizations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
