 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description: This project will use NSF support to increase student participation and enhance technical training at the 80th Device Research Conference (DRC), which brings together researchers from around the world to share their latest findings in the areas of electronic, opto-electronic, and quantum-based semiconductor devices. The 2022 DRC will be held from June 26-29 at the Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. While in-person attendance is strongly encouraged, the 2022 DRC will be available in a partial hybrid format for those unable to travel. The DRC offers unique training and networking opportunities, particularly to its student and young investigator attendees, helping them advance their careers in materials science, semiconductor technology, and device engineering. In addition, the DRC is committed to fostering greater diversity and equity for all attendees and at all levels. By stimulating an open and frank discussion of recent breakthroughs and advances in electronic and photonic devices, the DRC will remove barriers for underrepresented minority groups and support the NSF\u2019s Diversity Mission related to \u201cpreparing a diverse, globally engaged science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce.\u201d \r\n\r\nTechnical Description: The 2022 DRC will feature three plenary talks from world-renowned researchers in quantum photonic devices, ferroelectric devices, and electronics for extreme application environments. The conference will include presentations on devices for IoT, spintronic devices, memory devices, RF and terahertz devices, thin-film devices, and heterogeneous integration. In addition to plenary talks and oral presentations, the 2022 DRC will offer a half-day technical short course in \u201cCryogenic Computing Devices\u201d taught by prominent experts from academia and industry. The 2022 DRC will also feature two concurrent rump sessions titled \u201cThe Intersection of Industry and Academia: Training Future Researchers\u201d and \u201cWhat Should Be the Role of Computational Physics and Modeling in Enabling Next Generation Devices?\u201d to engage the audience in a vigorous and open discussion on these important topics. To encourage student engagement, the DRC gives awards every year for the Best Student Paper and the Best Student Poster. The conference program, including the rump session and the short course, will enhance the professional knowledge of all attendees. The information will be disseminated widely through conference proceedings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
