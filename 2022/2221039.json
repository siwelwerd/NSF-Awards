 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacteria, which often live in complex multi-species communities, are not limited to acquiring\r\ntheir genes from prior generations. Using a process called natural transformation, bacteria can\r\nalso acquire new genetic elements from neighbors and even from free DNA in the environment.\r\nIt is currently unknown which genetic sequences are most readily transferred via transformation.\r\nUnderstanding natural transformation at the genome and community scale requires development\r\nand application of novel algorithms to address this previously unexplored space. This project will\r\ndevelop computational methods to identify and predict which genetic functions are likely to spread\r\nthrough bacterial populations by natural transformation. Application of these computational\r\nmethods will help fill a void in understanding genetic evolution in bacterial communities which may\r\nbe overlooked by taxonomic identification. This in turn can lead to better assessment of risks or\r\nbenefits associated with bacterial community members and improved planning of synthetic\r\nbacterial communities. The project workflow will enable new capstone research experiences for\r\nundergraduates from multiple STEM majors on campus.\r\n\r\nThe connections between molecular and biological parameters that drive genome-wide gene\r\ntransfer preferences during bacterial natural transformation have been unexplored due to lack of\r\ngenome level experimental and computational analyses. The PI\u2019s laboratory has developed\r\nexperimental molecular genetic tools to collect and map natural transformation gene transfer sites\r\nacross diverse pairs of donor and recipient bacteria. However, the computational methods to\r\nquantify the driving functional parameters and ultimately to predict gene transfer dynamics\r\nassociated with natural transformation do not yet exist. Collaboration with the partner will use the\r\nexperimental data to generate genome scale statistical algorithms and computational tools for (i)\r\nglobal analysis of molecular and biological parameters governing gene transfer events, and (ii)\r\nprediction of gene transfer events that result specifically from natural transformation. This project\r\nwill enable expansion of the work beyond current molecular genetic analysis of natural\r\ntransformation to the genome and community scale.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
