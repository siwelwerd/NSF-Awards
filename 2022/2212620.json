 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the attendance of US-based researchers at the Nineteenth Latin American Symposium on Mathematical Logic (the Simposio Latino Americano de L\u00f3gica Matem\u00e1tica, or SLALM) at the Universidad de Costa Rica in San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica, on July 26-30, 2022.  The SLALM series meetings have been held intermittently since the 1960's, usually every two to four years, always in Latin America.  These meetings have been instrumental in the growth of the discipline of logic in the region during that time and in encouraging cooperation between the logic communities in North and South America, as researchers from the US and Canada frequently attend the SLALM.  With the expansion of this contact has come fruitful exchange:  the very top ranks of logicians in the U.S. include researchers born in Brazil and Uruguay, while U.S.-born logicians have taken permanent jobs in countries such as Colombia, and a substantial further number of researchers have traveled between the regions for postdoctoral positions. \r\n\r\nThis award supports the participation of as many as eighteen US-based logicians at the 2022 SLALM, with an emphasis on students and junior researchers, and with preference for researchers from groups underrepresented in mathematics.  The award is administered by the Association for Symbolic Logic, which has supported the SLALM series since its inception.  The 2022 SLALM includes plenary talks, four mini-courses, and five thematic sessions: computability; model theory; non-classical logics; philosophy of logic (with philosophical logic); and set theory.  The special sessions include prominent invited speakers and contributed talks in which younger researchers will have the opportunity to present their work.\r\n\r\nSLALM website: https://paginas.cimpa.ucr.ac.cr/slalm/index.php/en/\r\nASL website: https://aslonline.org/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis grant supported the participation of thirteen American researchers in the Latin American Mathematical Logic Symposium (Simposio Latino Americano de Logica Matematica, or SLALM) at the Universidad de Costa Rica in San Jose, the capital city of Costa Rica, in July 2022. The SLALM, held every two to three years, is the premier research conference in logic in Central and South America, and brings together experts in the subject from the entire length of the Americas. It is an official meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, the worldwide professional society for research in logic, bridging mathematics, philosophy, and computer science. With this grant, the US was able to send these scholars to represent our country at this meeting.\r\n\n\nThe thirteen researchers included four senior scholars, one postdoctoral researcher, and eight doctoral students (all from US universities, all across the nation, from Berkeley to Kansas State and Iowa State, to Penn State and the City University of New York, among others). Eight of them gave talks at the SLALM describing various aspects of their research. The students, of course, are currently developing their own research programs, so five of them did not yet have talks to offer, but all of them got to meet and work with key figures in their areas from many other countries.\r\n\n\nWe are gratified to report that four of the thirteen participants from the US were women: one senior researcher, who gave a two-part tutorial presentation, and three students. Many Latin American countries have made strides of their own recently in encouraging women in philosophy and STEM fields, but in general this movement began later in these countries than in the US. Our contingent helped illustrate the excellent work being done by many women in this area in the US, and we hope that this will encourage young female researchers across the Americas to emulate them. Additionally, four of our eight student participants are natives of Latin America, and their presence and advice is particularly likely to have encouraged local undergraduate students interested in logic to consider applying to graduate programs in the US.\r\n\n\n\nShortly before the SLALM began, two other US-based students who had planned to attend it found themselves unable to do so. With their funding going unused, we requested and obtained a no-cost extension of this grant from the NSF, which allowed us to use the remaining funds to support three US-based researchers at the next SLALM, in Montevideo, Uruguay in July 2024. Once again, one of them gave a tutorial presentation, while the other two both gave talks in special sessions. These were not the only US-based researchers who attended this meeting, but without the support from the NSF, US attendance would have been lower and our nation would not have been as well represented.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/20/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: RussellGMiller\n"
