 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whole genome sequencing across the tree of life has shown that new genes arise frequently in evolution. However, relatively little is known about the function or evolutionary importance of these genes in the derivation of novel phenotypes. This project will recruit postbaccalaureate trainees to engage in a cohort project to describe the genomes of species that are not well studied and to identify potentially new  genes in these genomes. In addition, trainees will engage in individual projects in a network of labs to characterize the function of novel genomic elements and their potential links to new traits in diverse taxa. These research projects will promote integrated research opportunities in molecular and computational biology. The program will support the training of a diverse set of 30 postbaccalaureate mentees, enriched for members from groups underrepresented in biology, for future success in STEM. Integral to the program are the broader impacts that include mentor training for PIs and co-mentors; training, mentoring, and networking opportunities; public outreach about genomes; and connections across departments, institutions, and industry. \r\n\r\nA major challenge in biology is determining how information encoded in the genome generates individual phenotypes and thus how differences in that information lead to unique phenotypic outcomes. Comparative genomic studies identified a highly conserved \u2018toolkit\u2019 of developmental genes that predates the diversification of major clades. One way that morphological novelty originates is through regulatory tinkering with these ancient toolkit genes. More recently, comparative studies have identified a profusion of new \u2018taxon-restricted genes,\u2019 which may also be important in the origin of phenotypic novelty. The functional characterization of genomic novelty in diverse taxa and diverse subfields of biology will be leveraged as the intellectual focal point for a new postbaccalaureate research training program. Individual research projects will address specific questions about the function of new genes in diverse taxa. Collectively, these projects address broader question about the role of new genes in evolution and development. Sequencing, assembly, and annotation of genomes will be done in collaboration with researchers at regional partner institutions. This project will help build a cross-institutional research network, provide trainees with bioinformatics training, and disseminate training materials for genomics. The training program will deploy individualized mentoring networks, cohort training workshops, professional development and networking opportunities, and interactions with PIs, mentors, peers and near-peers to help trainees identify and meet their professional goals.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
