 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the reduction of food waste and improved nutrition. Each year, more than 30% of fresh produce is wasted. The value of this wasted produce is estimated at more than $60 billion globally. This project\u2019s main goal is to extend the shelf life of perishable foods with an edible coating that regulates the rate of both transpiration to slow moisture loss and respiration to delay ripening. The project aims to enable produce growers and distributors to preserve the freshness and quality of fruits and vegetables. Consumers could benefit by having access to fresher, tastier, and more appealing produce. This technology may also promote healthier food choices, especially in currently underserved food deserts. Packers would benefit by being able to offer a high-quality product that will last longer and that can better withstand the rigors of various types of transport. Extended shelf life also extends the market reach of U.S. exports in global markets.\r\n\r\nThe core innovation underlying this project is the creation of stable Zein colloids that employ only edible, plant-based ingredients, are non-flammable, non-corrosive, and meet most global food regulations. These colloids will be initially developed as coatings for fresh whole or minimally processed foods, root crops, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.  The coating will not impede the delivery of nutrients, flavors, and other functional ingredients that make foods appealing, improve their quality, and encourage consumption.  The technology will also reduce food spoilage and improving food safety. Experimental work will be focused on further improving the stability of Zein dispersions and demonstrating the ability to adjust the film properties (water vapor, oxygen, and carbon dioxide permeances) to respond to the physiology of a broad range of crops. This technology will also be piloted at various packing plants to evaluate its operational fitness with existing operations. This research will also enable related applications, such as for compostable coatings on food packaging and pharmaceutical and nutraceutical coatings.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
