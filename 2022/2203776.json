 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of US-based researchers in the 2022 Workshop on Symmetries in Graphs, Maps, and Polytopes (SIGMAP) held at the University of Alaska Fairbanks July 10-16, 2022. Symmetry has motivated many important questions in mathematics, beginning with the study of the Platonic solids in antiquity. Symmetric discrete geometric objects, such as polyhedra or graphs, have a wide variety of applications, from understanding the structure of crystals and the shapes of viruses, to computer-aided modeling and optimization in networks. The workshop will bring together researchers from all over the world to discuss recent advances in the study of symmetries of discrete geometric objects, explore open problems, form new collaborations, and advance existing ones.\r\n\r\nThe major topic to be addressed at the workshop is the relation of symmetry, both combinatorial and geometric, to the study of graphs, maps, convex and abstract polytopes, and related algebraic and geometric structures. Established researchers in these areas will present recent work to their colleagues, advancing the state of knowledge in the field. The structure of the workshop will facilitate collaborations between current and new researchers in the area through active discussion of open problems and work sessions. Results from the workshop and related research will be disseminated through a special issue of The Art of Discrete and Applied Mathematics focused on Symmetries of Graphs, Maps, and Polytopes. More information about the workshop, including pre-registration forms and opportunities for travel support for US residents, is available at https://www.alaska.edu/sigmap.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
