 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global climate change and associated extreme weather events are increasingly impacting marine communities at all trophic levels and leading to shifts in the timing of life history events. This project is investigating the annual restart of the spring zooplankton community in the Gulf of Alaska in order to determine the timing of species-specific recruitment and growth. Zooplankton are small pelagic animals that are a critical link between microalgae and protozoans and higher levels in the food web including economically important fishes, birds and marine mammals. While their abundances and species composition have been documented over part of the annual cycle between late spring and fall, this project focuses on winter and early spring. The project integrates traditional methods with modern molecular approaches to characterize the diversity, development, feeding and physiology of zooplankton, especially the early developmental stages of copepods (small crustaceans). The goal is to determine which species are there, how many are present and where they are in the water column, and to reveal indicators of their health. Broader impacts include research training for three graduate students and at least four undergraduates in biological oceanography and physiological ecology. Outreach activities are focusing on broadening the public\u2019s understanding of plankton ecology. An illustrated zooplankton guide for the Gulf of Alaska and plankton module for school teachers and students is being produced in collaboration with the Center for Alaskan Coastal Studies. Other plans include sponsorship of nature-drawing workshops on zooplankton and the production of an Art & Science traveling exhibit. \r\n\r\nThis project is tracking zooplankton population abundances, species composition and developmental stages through the spring restart in a high-latitude fjord in the northern Gulf of Alaska. While the entire zooplankton community is being characterized, the main focus is on the difficult-to-assess early developmental stages of copepods, which dominate the late spring biomass in the region. Three central hypotheses guide the research: 1) high abundances of copepod nauplii are present before any measurable increases in food in surface waters;  2) species diversity increases between winter and spring, with nauplii from large lipid-rich capital-breeding species appearing first, followed by those from income- and hybrid-strategy species and finally nauplii that emerge from dormant eggs; 3) prior to the appearance of food resources, nauplii from capital-breeding species conserve resources by delaying development and entering a state of dormancy in the second and third naupliar stages. The project entails intensive depth-stratified field sampling to characterize the wild community, in combination with laboratory experiments on nauplii to determine their responsiveness to food. The prey are being characterized by measuring chlorophyll a, dietary and prey community DNA sequencing and flow cytometry to establish diversity and abundances. Size-fractionated zooplankton samples are being analyzed using microscopy and community DNA sequencing to ascertain species diversity, developmental stage distribution and abundances. Feeding activity is being measured using dietary DNA sequencing of nauplii followed by comparisons with the prey field. Dormancy in nauplii is being determined by differential gene expression of target genes (RT-qPCR) and high-throughput sequencing of mRNA of individuals (transcriptomics) and community samples (meta-transcriptomics). Short-term and long-term effects of food availability on dormancy, development and growth are being quantified in laboratory experiments. Broader impacts are focused on training of students in interdisciplinary research and state-of-art techniques, and public outreach to introduce plankton ecology to broader audiences.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
