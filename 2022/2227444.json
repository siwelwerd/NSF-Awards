 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical separations are of immense and increasing importance in the modern world. Separation steps are involved in producing every chemical product. Unfortunately, the research communities working on chemical separations above typically work in isolation. This conference, which will be the second in the series, will bring together chemists, materials scientists and chemical engineers working with a wide range of separations technologies. The ability for attendees to hear from experts in a diverse range of applications domains will be attractive to both seasoned researchers and early career professionals. The conference program includes 21 invited speakers and 9 discussion leaders, representing both chemical engineering and chemistry research. The invited speakers come from academia, national labs and industry.\r\n\r\nThis conference responds directly to issues highlighted in the 2019 National Academies report \u201cA Research Agenda for Transforming Separation Science\u201d. A key recommendation of that report is that \u201cThe chemistry and chemical-engineering separation communities should seek opportunities for substantive interactions that will inspire creativity and the integration of concepts in research and education.\u201d The GRC format achieves precisely this goal, and does so under the aegis of one of the world\u2019s most respected scientific conference organizations. Chemical Separations is one of the four major research areas in the Chemical Process Systems Cluster in the Interfacial Engineering Program at NSF. The conference will contribute to advancing the forefront of science and engineering by having presentation and discussion of the latest fundamental discoveries and innovations.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
