 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interactions between foragers and agriculturalists are widely recognized as pivotal processes of cultural, technological, linguistic, and genetic changes worldwide. This doctoral dissertation research assesses the responses of hunter-gatherer groups to the first introduction of farmers and their products. This is not only significant to understanding the nature of these interactions, but also for reconstructing watershed moments of change for modern descendant populations. Outputs from this project will be used to develop new interpretive materials for heritage organizations at the state and federal levels, especially the National Park Service. Additionally, the researchers will provide training on basic animal identification and analyses at the State Historical Society of North Dakota to the public and Indigenous community members. These outputs will increase scientific literacy and engagement. This research involves the formulation of a collaboration plan with members of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation, with planned lectures and/or curriculum development for tribal schools.  As such, a broader impact will be increased partnership between academia, public heritage organizations, and Indigenous nations.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates the nature of contact between hunter-gatherers and farmers on the North American Great Plains using isotopic and ancient DNA analysis of dog remains from 17 previously excavated sites spanning from BC 6450 to AD 1880.  It will do so by tracking the use of maize by communities, before, during, and after the first introduction of farming by using dog diet as a proxy for maize presence. Ancient DNA analyses will differentiate dogs from wolves and coyotes, and stable isotope analyses will determine the degree of maize in the dogs\u2019 diets. Dogs are found in almost all archaeological assemblages on the northern Plains and consumed food and waste produced by their owners just as they do today. These datasets, when used in concert with archaeological data, will help illustrate the nature of forager-farmer interactions, mainly rejection, economic exchange, adoption. Specifically, this research addresses how and when these relationships originally formed, and how they changed over time. This project uses the Canine Surrogacy Approach as a new tool for identifying these interactions. Although dogs were crucial to the livelihoods of many different historic North American Indigenous groups, ancient DNA research of dogs from the Great Plains is limited. Ancient DNA, while used primarily in this research to identify dog remains from wild coyotes and wolves, will also contribute to the greater understanding of the variability of dogs in the Americas and potentially shed light on the timing of breeding with non-indigenous breeds from Europe.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
