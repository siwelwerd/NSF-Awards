 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by identifying factors that contribute to college engineering major choice and degree attainment. The overarching goal of the project is to address disparities in engineering degree attainment and to strengthen the scientific and technological workforce development in the U.S. This project will help advance the understanding of participation in engineering based on the analysis of factors at the individual, familial, high school, neighborhood, and community levels that contribute to college going, engineering major choice, and engineering degree attainment. By applying an asset-based framework to the examination of multiple dimensions of students\u2019 experiences over time, this project can contribute to reframing conversations and reinvigorating the development of strategies that may have the greatest potential in increasing participation in engineering and enhancing engineering workforce talent development. Outcomes of this project may provide important context and information for various applications, such as policy formation, development of strategies and interventions to promote access and recruitment, strengthening partnerships between K-12 and postsecondary educational institutions, and promoting a competitive scientific and technological workforce.  \r\n\r\nThis project emphasizes credible identification of the patterns and mechanisms associated with the academic trajectories of students through a mixed methods research design. This project leverages nationally representative data from the High School Longitudinal Study and the Education Longitudinal Study to examine the pathways of students from high school through college engineering using econometric methods. Moreover, individual interviews with students and their parents/guardians across three different institutions provide opportunities to uncover students\u2019 experiences and counter stories. The quantitative and qualitative findings will be integrated to develop a longitudinal conceptual model to illustrate the important factors that affect engineering major choice and degree attainment. This project focuses on critical transition points between K-12 and postsecondary education, such that research findings have the potential to advance foundational knowledge to help key stakeholders make informed decisions in promoting engineering at both the K-12 and early college levels. The project scope has the potential for broad and meaningful impact across disciplines and communities given the comprehensive dissemination strategy, which is intended to reach practitioners, policy makers, and the educational research community including engineering education, education policy, and economics. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
