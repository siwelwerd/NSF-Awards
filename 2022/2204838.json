 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. Tuskegee University seeks to develop bimodal teachable units based on backward design that will allow seamless switching between online and in-person teaching modes, to be implemented in selected undergraduate physics courses to help achieve equity and promote student learning outcomes regardless of gender, race, and economic background.\r\n\r\nThe research will be driven by two overarching questions: (1) How can teachable units and materials be structured for a seamless switch between in-person and online instruction and culturally tailored to a) reduce misconceptions in science and technology subjects, and b) improve student motivation to pursue Physics and other science majors at Historically Black Institutions? (2) Do culturally tailored bimodal teachable units with diversity components enhance a) students\u2019 ability to connect concepts, b) confidence in tackling science problems, and c) the faculty\u2019s adaptation of scientific teaching methodologies? The project will be implemented in three different physics lectures and their corresponding laboratories in two phases. In phase I, teachable units will be implemented in a hybrid setup. During phase II, diverse assessments will be used as a learning tool. The teachable units rooted in scientific teaching principles will provide feedback to instructors and students about learning, design activities, and assessments to help diverse students create and achieve learning goals representing the nature of science. The instructional materials and activities, including characters from underrepresented communities and familiar examples, are expected to motivate the students to pursue physics and other fundamental science majors. The assessment and survey data from this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the delivery and assessment types that maximize knowledge retention among diverse students. The project will create awareness and foster self-examination among instructors regarding the need to include culturally relevant and diverse instructional materials during course content creation for student success.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
