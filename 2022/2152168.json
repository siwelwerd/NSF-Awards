 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum networks enable more efficient information processing, promising functionality that is faster and more secure than the classical networks that undergird current communication technologies. Research on quantum networks has the potential to contribute to fundamental discoveries in quantum science as well as key applications in cybersecurity, quantum sensors, and quantum computing. However, to realize the promised advantages of a quantum Internet, many fundamental science and engineering challenges must be overcome. Tackling these challenges will require a convergence of expertise from science and engineering disciplines and the development of a well-trained, interdisciplinary quantum networks workforce. The overarching goal of this NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) project is to advance the design and development of components and applications of quantum networks, and to establish the first comprehensive, interdisciplinary quantum information science and engineering (QISE) training program in the Southeast. Representing a collaboration between the University of Georgia and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, this training program is expected to serve fifty-four masters and doctoral students, including thirty-four funded trainees in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis project will carry out quantum networks research in three key areas. The first centers on quantum network building blocks: single photon emitters, qubit realization, quantum photon measurement, quantum information theory, and cybersecurity. The second encompasses quantum devices: networked quantum computing, networked quantum sensors, and materials for quantum network components. The third area considers scientific and engineering applications: space-based entangled photon sources, quantum random number generators, the power grid, quantum resource estimation, and on-chip technology. These three research thrusts will be bridged by three cross-disciplinary research perspectives: experimentation, simulation, and engineering. The training program and workforce development will significantly contribute to fulfilling the pressing need for a skilled QISE workforce in academia, national laboratories, and industry. It will include components uniquely designed to increase the involvement of diverse students in QISE. It will strengthen existing ties that the two collaborating institutions have with historically black colleges and universities, and the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Leadership and Academic Enhancement Program, for robust recruitment, mentoring, and retention of women and minority students from groups underrepresented in the field. In addition, it will engage potential undergraduate recruits with QISE topics via introductory QISE courses that can be taken for credit across institutions. This traineeship model will create an interdisciplinary, workforce-aligned program integrating experimental, simulational, and engineering experiential learning to galvanize a diverse community of graduate students toward careers in QISE.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
