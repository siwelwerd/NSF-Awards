 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research-practice partnership project is studying the impacts of and impediments to a district-wide diffusion of an equity-centered computer science curriculum in 32 elementary schools. The partnership is employing a teacher-co-designed  curriculum that integrates the concepts and practices defined in the Massachusetts Digital Literacy and Computer Science framework with other standards-based elementary English language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies curricula. The project is using a phased approach for adapting and fully implementing the curriculum in three cohorts of ten to eleven  schools each year, including updating and improving on the curriculum, ensuring the  curriculum is taught to all students, connecting to student identities and critical perspectives, and preparing elementary students to enter pathways ready to achieve the goals of the district for its graduates.\r\n\r\nThe project uses a Diffusion of Innovation theory framework in its research and evaluation to guide the diffusion of computer science knowledge, instructional skills, and diversity, equity, and inclusion practices within every school towards a sustainable model for integrated elementary-level computer science learning. The project focuses on curriculum implementation/revision, professional learning communities, and coaching. Surveys, other data collection, and case study observations in classrooms and schools will examine student learning, teacher uptake and efficacy, professional learning community structures, and fidelity to the curriculum and to included culturally responsive pedagogies. Research outcomes will inform a continuous curriculum revision and implementation process throughout project and afterwards. The project will determine how equity-centered and integrated computer science and computational thinking instruction diffuses over time in the target elementary schools, how these diffusion activities affect the depth and rate teachers become aware, adopt, initiate, and routinize integrated computer science and computational thinking instruction, and how we may understand the cultural and system factors influence the diffusion of the computer science and computational thinking curricula. This project is funded through the CS for All: Research and RPPs program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
