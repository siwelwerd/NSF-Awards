 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Jeffrey White of Oklahoma State University and Steven Crossley, Daniel Resasco and Bin Wang of University of Oklahoma will carry out an interdisciplinary study of new zeolite catalysts. The need for robust but sustainable catalysts that can convert molecules derived from a variety of sources, including traditional hydrocarbons, waste streams, and plant-based feedstocks into energy carriers and building blocks for consumable and durable goods requires fundamental understanding of catalyst design variables, resulting function, and environmental impacts.  Solid-acid catalysts, including the important class of materials known as zeolites, are attractive for the processing of new feedstocks as well as reducing harmful byproducts in conversion of traditional hydrocarbons, due to the variety of designable structures and topologies.  These catalysts are environmentally benign and do not require use of precious metals. The team will be engaged in a research collaboration to identify new catalyst materials that meet the challenges posed by unconventional and water-rich feeds, as well as reduce environmental footprints.  The collaborative team will train students at all college levels, including undergraduate, graduate, and under-represented groups, to be active contributors to the national STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) infrastructure. Through publication outlets and local, state, national, and international meetings, the team will increase awareness of how fundamental catalysis research impacts economically important industries, both present and future, and will attract attention from industrial partners.\r\n\r\nThe collaborative team will use an interdisciplinary synthesis, characterization, simulation, and reaction analysis approach to create and characterize new zeolite catalysts where the distribution of isolated, paired, proximate, and synergistic active sites are controlled. Drs. White, Resasco, Wang and Crossley will be engaged in tailored synthesis of zeolites, post-synthetic modifications of zeolites, in-situ spectroscopic NMR measurements, and reactor studies at varying temperature and pressure to determine how catalyst active site placement, distribution, and temporal behavior respond in key reactions involving both traditional and non-traditional feedstocks.  Goals include reduction of unwanted chemical byproducts, which ultimately lead to increased CO2 emissions, and control of reversible vs. irreversible active site degradation pathways. The team will endeavor to advance inclusion of underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines through programs on each campus, and increase public awareness of the benefit of catalysis through public media outlets at the university and state level.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
