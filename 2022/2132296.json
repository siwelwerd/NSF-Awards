 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (PRF) proposal focuses on developing a better process-level understanding of the chemistry of organic nitrates in the atmosphere. This project includes laboratory, field, and modeling work that will provide fundamental experimental and observational constraints on the photolytic, oxidative, and heterogeneous degradation pathways of organic nitrates. This research is expected to greatly improve model parameterizations of the fate of organic nitrates in the atmosphere, important for resolving the atmospheric nitrogen budget. \r\n\r\nThe research will: (1) synthesize a series of authentic monoterpene-derived organic nitrates (RONO2), (2) systematically evaluate the kinetics, products, and mechanisms of their photolysis, oxidation, and hydrolysis in targeted laboratory experiments using advanced mass spectrometric techniques, (3) incorporate experimental findings into a state-of-the-science global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem), and (4) use the experiments and updated model framework to interpret measurements of monoterpenes, O3, NOx, and speciated RONO2 that will be collected as part of the NSF GreaterNY Oxidant, Trace Gas, Halogen, and Aerosol Airborne Mission (GOTHAAM).\r\n\r\nThe PI will work with the Stony Brook University Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science to provide information to the public on better understanding issues associated with air quality and climate.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
