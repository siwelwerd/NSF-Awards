 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) will hold a 3-day workshop on \u201cA Transformational Africa-US STEM University Partnership\". The workshop will bring together 30-40 senior public officials, and leaders from university, and the private sector from both Africa and the US. The Workshop will review experiences, achievements, and best practices of recent large-scale initiatives to build STEM research and education capacity in materials research and other related fields such as food security; energy; mining, minerals, and climate change on the continent and to promote collaboration with US counterparts. The workshop will also identify priorities for joint work and innovative modalities for collaboration between US and African universities. The proceedings will be published by the National Academies Press and disseminated. The workshop will include a diverse group of attendees, including underrepresented minorities and early career professionals. The Workshop is supported by the Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, the Directorate for Geosciences, and the Office of International Sciences and Engineering.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
