 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will collect and analyze perishable data on historical buildings. The Blue Heron Paper Mill Site located by the Willamette Falls in Oregon City, Oregon, has a very intriguing history and was recently purchased by the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde with the intent to restore the falls to their natural state and preserve some of the oldest structures. The site presents a unique opportunity to perform rapid investigations to collect and analyze perishable data on these historical buildings and develop new knowledge in the area of building assessments in corrosive environments. This industrial site contains a wide range of structure types (steel frames, concrete frames, timber frames, masonry walls and massive concrete walls) that were built over a period of 150 years and that employ many construction details that are common in older structures. The data collected and the results of the research will be applicable to many buildings in coastal communities throughout the country.\r\n\r\nLidar data sets collected from these buildings will support the development of new methods to analyze and synthesize large data sets as well as integrate visual observations and material testing to quantify structural deterioration damages. The challenge in developing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to find and quantify damage in structural systems using lidar data is the need to train the methods on existing data sets that show a wide range of damage states. The data to be collected from this site will provide an extensive training data set relevant to structural components common to older buildings. Development of such AI technologies for fast identification and quantification of damage would be transformative for the natural hazards research community and would expand the ability to learn from archived lidar datasets. The collected dataset will be available to researchers to serve as high quality training data in algorithm development.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

This 23-acre historic site has a very intriguing history such as serving as a sacred fishing site for the tribal community, a mill to provide food for the pioneer settlements at the end of the historic Oregon Trail, a major paper mill employing a significant portion of the local community for decades, and a site where many popular movies and TV shows have been filmed.</p>\n<p>Given the historical and cultural impact, the research team at Oregon State University (OSU) partnering with CTGR deployed state-of-the-art geomatics equipment to perform rigorous control survey, terrestrial laser scanning, drone surveying (photogrammetry and lidar), and hydrographic surveying to collect such perishable data and produce high-quality 3D models as a way to digitally preserve the historical site. During the project period, the OSU geomatics team collected over 1,500 scans and dozens of UAS flights to caputre both indoor and outdoor space of the site including complex underground space and tunnels. The 3D point cloud data with precise geolocation provide centimeter level coverage of the entire site and thanks to the rigorous control, the absolute georeferencing accuracy is in few centimeters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the data collection period, the research team also invited graduate students, faculty, and professionals to the site to learn about history about the site as well have hands-on training and expereince with the reality capture equipment. Aside from digital preservation, the data products have also been leveraged by the tribes in multiple occasions to overcome engineering challenges. For example, planning the demolition of a few structures on the site became a challenge due to the underground space built in a different era with different materials. The comprehensive 3D model enables engineers to perform virtual survey by making measurements to plan the demolition. Another example is an on-going effort of utilizing the georeferenced 3D datasets along with the high water marks with the precise elevation captured to conduct floodplain analysis.</p>\n<p>The data also enables new methodology development and testing for structural analysis such as leveraging the detailed geometric information of the structure under corrosive environments provided in the 3D point cloud in finite element analysis. For example, the research team developed a framwork utilizing laser scanning data to extract information for generating finite element models to achieve seismic structural assessments on a system level. Then with the similar concept, the team further performed bukling analysis on member level including uncertainty quantification. The proposed framework was demonstrated to be effective to use the geometric information extracted from the lidar point cloud data in both system-level (e.g., 1st mode period, inter-story drifts, and seismic base shear of the corroded steel structure) and memeber-level (e.g., axial compressive capacity) structural analysis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most of the datasets have been published on design-safe:&nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.17603/ds2-etqp-j708\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.17603/ds2-etqp-j708</a>&nbsp;.
