 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the 2022 Biology and Medicine through Mathematics (BAMM) conference, held May 18-20, 2022, at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia. The aim of the conference is to highlight recent developments in the fields of mathematical biology and medicine. The meeting will: i) provide a regional biomathematics conference that promotes junior investigators (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty); ii) give visibility to a range of applications and methods in mathematical biology; and iii) provide a good environment for networking between junior and senior researchers.  The conference will host approximately 100 attendees. The conference will be a mix of plenary talks, break-out sessions, and a poster session.  Travel support will increase the accessibility of the conference by junior researchers.\r\n\r\nJunior researchers (undergraduates and graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and early career faculty) will benefit from participating in this meeting. BAMM will provide an intimate conference environment with opportunities to present a poster or give a talk for researchers at all levels. Student researchers new to the field will have excellent opportunities to attend talks from many sub-fields. Participation of women and members of minorities underrepresented in mathematics and science will be encouraged and supported. The participant demographics from the 2019 conference indicate that travel awards have a positive contribution to the diversity of the participants. The organizers anticipate a similar, positive impact on this year's event.\r\n\r\nConference web site: https://siam.vcu.edu/bamm/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
