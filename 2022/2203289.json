 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program in the National Science Foundation Division of Chemistry, and partial co-funding from the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, Professor Anyin Li\u2019s group at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) is exploring the fundamental processes underlying electrospray ionization mass spectrometry - one of the most important analytical methods used for characterization of organic, biological, and biochemical systems, including drug discovery and quality control. The methods being developed target improved analytical figures of merit, providing new opportunities to solve fundamental problems as well as to enhance UNH\u2019s interaction with local industry and education partners. The research activities train graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, thereby increasing the talent pool for a stronger STEM workforce. K-12 science teacher participation produces contemporary science teaching materials to engage student interest. The research group is also hosting summer workshops for broad dissemination of science and technology.\r\n\r\nExisting electrospray ionization (ESI) methods have onset ionization currents on the order of nanoamps, much higher than needed by most mass analyzers. They are often plagued by non-uniform ionization efficiency, formation of nonspecific adducts, and (for small emitters) clogging. To address these issues, the Li group is advancing and characterizing ESI in the femtoamp range, with flow rates on the order of picoliters/minute. The developed methods can extend the linear dynamic range to both lower and higher concentrations, while improving spectral quality and reducing matrix interferences and variations in ionization efficiency.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
