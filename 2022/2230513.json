 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2022 ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC) is a premier international conference for presenting research results, problem solutions, and insights on the design and use of parallel and distributed systems for high end computing, collaboration, data analysis, and other innovative applications. The conference brings together researchers, developers and users from academia, industry, and national laboratories to discuss recent advances and trends in many areas related to parallel and distributed computing.  The conference will be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, from June 27 - July 1, 2022. The project will fund students to participate in the conference, to engage deeply with the HPDC research community.  The students will improve their overall research skills and many of them will be presenting posters and papers. The project serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission, to promote the progress of science as it provides a forum to disseminate research efforts, connect researchers, and train the next generation of scholars.\r\n\r\nThe student program committee for the conference is recruiting students with an emphasis on diversity and inclusion of underrepresented groups and from a diverse set of institutions.  To ensure that funded students are actively participating in the conference, they will be required to submit a written report summarizing their experience at the conference, including what papers and posters they found interesting and how those papers and posters are related to their current research. The conference travel grant committee will also meet with the funded students at the beginning of the conference, to provide advice to students on how to interact with conference speakers and to set up connections with senior conference attendees.  The funding provided by NSF will have a significant impact on the careers of the future generation of researchers in high performance parallel and distributed computing, while encouraging diversity in the field.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
