 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the potential development of methods to characterize quantum devices and other materials at ultra-low temperatures.  Many advanced materials for critical next-generation technologies are interesting to study but can only be tested at very low temperatures. These include quantum materials and devices used for quantum computing, magnets, superconductors, batteries, and more. The proposed technology may allow for structural characterization of these devices at or near their operating temperatures. More broadly, some material specimens such as polymers, battery electrolytes, and biological matter are highly sensitive to conditions found inside an electron microscope and are easily damaged or destroyed during imaging. Cooling these specimens may preserve their structure by slowing or arresting pathways to degradation and allow for sustained structural characterization using real-space imaging. The proposed technology may enable useful atomic resolution imaging for a variety of applications in a wide range of industries.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the development of an atomically stable specimen holder for use within transmission electron microscopes (TEM) that enables extreme low-temperature cryogenic imaging of materials at atomic resolution. Existing technological attempts have been unable to provide low-temperature imaging of materials due to excessive vibrations and instability introduced by traditional cooling methods. Advancement also has been challenged by limited physical space that makes the introduction of cryogens and other stimuli difficult. The proposed technology focuses on designs to potentially overcome space constraints imposed by electron microscopes and reduce vibration to enable stable imaging. This project will evaluate the commercial impact of atomic resolution low-temperature electron microscopy on the quantum device, semiconductor, and soft biological, and chemical material industries to enable next-generation computational and electronic technologies.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
