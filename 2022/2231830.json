 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of low-cost sprayable, fast-acting enzymes/microorganisms that degrade organophosphonate into environmentally-friendly intermediates or final products, reducing envirionmental pollution from these agrochemicals. The increased use of phosphonates (as cleaning agents, coolants, and pesticides, etc.) is problemmatic due to their slow degradability and resultant  accumulation in the environment. The proposed technology seeks to selectively degrade organophosphonates including glyphosate herbicides.  The proposed project will support the development of strategies for safe and effective use of agrochemicals and household chemicals for various essential applications.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project is based on the productio of three phosphonatases by overexpressing them heterogously in fast-growing cyanobacterial strains. These enzymes can be used for the removal of phosphonate contaminants in soil and water systems. Thermophilic cyanobacteria species from Hot Springs, Arkansas are also identified as strains expressing these enzymes in high levels. This projects seeks use the novel mechanisms of organophosphonate degradation and to help clean the environment. Several cyanobacterial species may be able to survive on organophosphonate as the only source of phosphorus, breaking down organophosphonates.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
