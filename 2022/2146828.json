 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops testing and intervention (quarantine) methods in the presence of a pandemic. COVID-19 has revealed the key role of  epidemiological models and testing in the fight against disease spreading. For any new virus or variant of the existing ones, society will always need to be able to expeditiously deploy strategies that allow efficient testing of populations and empower targeted interventions.  Group testing is a method that has recently attracted attention for efficient testing, as it allows to identify the infected individuals in a population with many fewer tests than the ones needed to test everyone individually. A main new observation in this project is that viral diseases like SARS-CoV-2 are governed by community spread, and taking into account (even partial) knowledge of  the community structure in an epidemics model (e.g., the distribution of students in classes of a school) can make such testing much more efficient and effective.\r\nPreliminary results indicate that it is possible to estimate the infection spread and evaluate the impact of interventions using a much smaller number of tests than  traditional techniques.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the goal of the project is to leverage community structure and epidemic dynamics to enable real-time estimation of infection and intervention with the following attributes: (i) it is robust to model uncertainties; (ii) it offers provable theoretical performance guarantees and (iii) it achieves low complexity of operation. To do so, the proposal combines tools from coding theory and control, and proceeds in two steps. First, assuming complete and perfect knowledge of the true underlying dynamical model, it derives test designs and intervention strategies, as well as fundamental bounds on the number of tests and amount of intervention, for both a static and state-estimation problem formulation. Building on this first step, the proposal then considers approximations to the dynamic models either because the exact dynamics are not perfectly known, or for complexity-reduction reasons. In particular, the proposal develops approximations on the evolution of marginal probabilities for popular epidemic models, derives and analyzes discretized models, explores the effect of parameter uncertainty and investigate decomposable community models; in all cases, the goal is to understand how these approximations provably affect the associated fundamental bounds, test designs, and intervention strategies to contain the disease.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
