Qubits and novel quantum devices such as quantum emitters lie at the center of the ongoing quantum information revolution that is expected to transform science and society in previously unimaginable ways. Quantum defects, such as missing atoms or impurities, in two-dimensional materials offer a new paradigm for the realization of patterned fabrication and operation of quantum functionality components. By incorporating symmetry-guided design principles and data-driven approaches, the PI and his team will facilitate breakthroughs for the discovery and design of novel quantum defects with unique electronic structures for quantum information science and technologies. The research will pave the path toward the creation of a quantum defect design platform.\r\n\r\nThe research project will be integrated with educational activities through the incorporation of numerical simulations and machine learning modules, as well as outreach activities to K-12 students. Quantum materials, machine learning, and numerical simulation modules will be incorporated in undergraduate and graduate courses. The construction of an interdisciplinary research environment will allow multi-level students to acquire a complete set of skills and grasp a big picture of quantum information science. The PI will participate in scientific outreach by developing activity kits and demos in collaboration with local science museums including the Franklin Institute. Educational modules for middle school and high school students will be developed to introduce quantum physics and artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research activities to develop and utilize first-principles computations and data-driven approaches to provide insights into the quantum phenomena in technologically important defect-based two-dimensional (2D) quantum systems. Quantum defects are characterized by local symmetries and complex interactions with their host materials. The research will advance fundamental understanding of quantum defects in 2D materials as spin qubits and quantum emitters by revealing the interplay of local symmetry and host environment. By harnessing symmetry information and adopting state-of-the-art learning architectures, the PI and his team will develop a novel machine learning framework to enable the use of deep learning for defect property predictions. The ultimate outcome of this project will be to provide fundamental understanding and symmetry-based design principles for targeted quantum defect functionalities in 2D materials and beyond. This will open a new data-driven pathway for quantum information science and technologies based on quantum defects in 2D solid-state systems.\r\n\r\nThe research project will be integrated with educational activities through the incorporation of numerical simulations and machine learning modules, as well as outreach activities to K-12 students.
