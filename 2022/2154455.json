 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 38th annual Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM 38) will be held on the campus of the University of Florida, Gainesville Florida, March 5-7, 2022. SEAM is a leading national venue for mathematical analysis and its applications. The meeting promotes and encourages research and education in the field of analysis and the dissemination and exchange of the latest ideas and developments in operator theory and function theory and related subjects while encouraging the participation and professional development of both junior members of the analysis research community and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. Its mission includes promoting interaction and collaboration between researchers at all career stages.\r\n\r\nSEAM brings together senior researchers, early-career faculty, postdocs, and graduate students to discuss recent work and advances in Function Theoretic Operator Theory \u2014 the mathematics at the intersection of Operator Theory, Classical Complex Analysis, Harmonic Analysis, and Several Complex Variables \u2014 and related areas and fields of application, including Operator Algebras, Spaces, and Systems; Systems and Scattering theory; Control Theory; and Partial Differential Equations (PDE), to name a few.  The scientific program consists of plenary talks, by leaders both senior and junior, and twenty minute contributed talks open to all participants. Professional development activities for early career researchers is also part of the program. The plenary talks are on topics such as as optimal polynomial approximation; multiplication operators on Hilbert spaces of analytic functions; Foundational aspects of Operator Theory and Operator Algebras; Operator systems and Quantum information; PDE and harmonic maps; and applications of Harmonic Analysis to sampling and signal processing. The meeting website is hosted at:  https://people.clas.ufl.edu/sam/seam-38/\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
