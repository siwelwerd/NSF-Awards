 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to serve the national interest by developing a quantum information science and technology curriculum with experiential learning for undergraduate STEM students. Emerging quantum technologies promise to revolutionize computing, communication, networking, and sensing in unconventional ways and with information security. This has created a need for a new generation of engineers, scientists, and programmers who can apply quantum science and technology principles in the STEM workforce. The multidisciplinary nature of quantum technologies poses challenges to providing a comprehensive education for students from different degree programs who may lack the technical background in some areas. This project aims to lower entry barriers for students, to develop transferable skillsets for quantum computing and engineering, to generate knowledge about conditions for creative teaching and effective student learning in this multidisciplinary field, and to prepare students for entering this rapidly emerging field. The success of this project should lead to large numbers of undergraduate engineering and science students equipped with essential quantum knowledge and skills and a new quantum education program adaptable for undergraduate STEM students at other institutions.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to advance knowledge of the learning process for undergraduate students from multiple STEM disciplines in studying quantum information science and technology, and then to develop new online modules and a scalable learning paradigm for effectively teaching quantum fundamentals. The scope includes both software and hardware aspects and encompasses related engineering and science disciplines. The project team plans to study the technical and cognitive entry barriers to quantum science and engineering, create modules for teaching quantum fundamentals, develop experiential learning tools, and seamlessly integrate new tools and modules into existing undergraduate engineering curricula. The research team will investigate the conditions under which improved student learning of quantum science and engineering occurs and further study the effectiveness of the created tools and approaches. The new quantum engineering learning platform and curriculum developed in this project should advance engineering and science education and workforce development in this emerging technology frontier. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
