 "awd_abstract_narration": "How people use language is a topic of study in a variety of fields, including linguistics, literature, law, and\r\nlanguage education. Extensive descriptions about many languages already exist in natural language itself\r\n(e.g., grammar textbooks, writing advice, and linguistics articles). Descriptions in (for example) English\r\nmay include example sentences supplemented with technical terminology and formal notation. This\r\nproject will develop natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to process and mine these textual\r\nresources so that language analysts can better detect and synthesize patterns of interest. First, algorithms\r\nwill be developed to recognize where a piece of text is commenting on the meaning of a word, or giving\r\nan example of how it could be used. Second, algorithms for enriching text with technical descriptions will\r\nbe improved to report better estimates of their own strengths and weaknesses. Finally, capabilities for\r\nretrieving specific uses of an ambiguous word in a large text collection will be developed to aid analysts.\r\nThe algorithmic contributions in this project are expected to have direct application to technologies in\r\nvarious fields where close analysis of language in text collections is crucial, including law and linguistics.\r\nOn a wider scale, these capabilities have the potential to be transformative for artificial intelligence (AI),\r\nallowing humans and machines to teach each other explicitly about how language works, to deftly access\r\nscholarly work about language, and to give and interpret language advice (e.g., writing assistance).\r\n\r\nThis project develops algorithms and tasks with an eye toward technologies that would enable humans to\r\nmore efficiently and accurately conduct metalinguistic inquiries about text. Key challenges to be\r\naddressed are: (1) Detecting textual metalanguage: This project will formulate tasks and algorithms to\r\nrecognize metalinguistic descriptions (such as the use/mention distinction, definitions, linguistic\r\nexamples) in text, focusing on three genres where they are abundant: law, language discussion forums,\r\nand linguistics. A new benchmark dataset and shared task will be developed to compare metalinguistic\r\ntaggers. (2) Improving model confidence calibration, focusing on taggers with long-tail tagsets. Better\r\nprobability estimates will enable analysts to make informed decisions about how to balance automatic and\r\nmanual processing and can anticipate rates of different types of errors. (3) Query-by-example algorithms\r\nwill be developed for retrieving specific usages of an ambiguous word or phrase from a large text\r\ncollection. Tools leveraging such algorithms would open the way to new kinds of corpus-based\r\ninvestigations by linguists, lexicographers, language teachers, and literary scholars.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
