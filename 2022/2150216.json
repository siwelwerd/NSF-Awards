 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to Rice University, located in Houston, TX sponsors the preparation of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2022-2024. In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry and the Department of Defense ASSURE program, students participate in research projects focused on advancing Chemical Nanoscale Science and Technology.  As part of the program, the students are exposed to a variety of professional development and leadership training activities in addition to personal mentoring in their individual projects. The combination of strategic recruitment, research, professional development, and leadership activities allows this REU site to support education and diversity to prepare the new generation of leaders in STEM.\r\n \r\nThe participating students work on individual projects related to different subareas in Chemical Nanosciences including, Nano Materials, Nano Medicine, Nano Organic, Nano Theory/Computation, Nano Physical, and Nano Imaging.  In addition, the students partake in professional leadership training in collaboration with the Doerr Institute for New Leaders, professional development activities in partnership with the Rice Center for Career Development, and the Rice Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies, and scientific literacy activities organized by the PI team.  The long-term objective of this REU site is to enhance the preparation, number, and diversity of students pursuing graduate degrees and careers in STEM. Appropriate representation is ensured by recruiting students through established partnerships with minority-serving institutions and primarily undergraduate institutions.\r\n\r\nThis site is supported by the Department of Defense ASSURE program in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
