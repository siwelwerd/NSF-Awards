 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, conducted by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, investigates an approach for dynamically sharing the electromagnetic (radio-frequency) spectrum. The project goal is to help radio astronomy facilities observe successfully in the presence of transmissions by low-earth-orbit satellites, and to help satellite operators by potentially enabling them to transmit in all channels of the satellite transmission band. (Currently some satellite transmission bands are left unused to protect radio telescope observation in adjacent bands.) The project includes design and modeling of the spectrum sharing mechanism and prototyping of a data portal for information sharing between astronomy facilities and satellite operators. Supporting project activities include measurement and analysis of spectrum use near the Jansky Very Large Array in New Mexico. Field tests include collaboration with Space Exploration Technologies Corp. Collaboration is also being explored with OneWeb, another leading satellite network provider. By enhancing spectrum access for radio astronomy, the project supports better scientific return from observatory investments. By enhancing spectrum access for satellite transmissions, the project enhances the social and economic benefits that come from increasing the amount of wireless communications supported by the limited available spectrum, particularly in rural locations. The project will support the development of a low RFI museum display prototype, involve undergraduates in summer projects related to this work, develop a Citizen Science RFI project with affiliated academic institutions, and devise a graduate certificate curriculum in spectrum-related work. \r\n\r\nThe spectrum sharing concept relies on cooperation between the astronomy facility and satellite operators. Groups of channels in the satellite transmission band are agreed upon in advance. The observatory provides a data portal for satellite operators to access the current operating status of observatory instruments. Satellites pointing transmission beams towards or near the astronomy facility at times when observatory instruments are using the band transmit in only one of the channel groups. The channel group in use changes over time, enabling the radio astronomy instruments to observe in all channels of the satellite transmission band over time. The supporting project activities include full analysis and characterization of historical and current RFI in the 10.7-12.7 GHz band at the Very Large Array in New Mexico and the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia; enhancing the current spectrum monitoring device with multi-sensor networking, improved direction finding, and new capabilities developed through machine learning techniques; and planning for future spectrum monitoring device improvements and cost reductions. The investigation of machine learning techniques for spectrum monitoring will be carried out in collaboration with the National Research Council of Canada Herzberg Astronomy & Astrophysics Research Centre.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
